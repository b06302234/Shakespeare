riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
then plainly know my heart's dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet.
as mine on hers, so hers is set on mine, and all combined, save what thou must combine by holy marriage.
when and where and how we met, we wooed and made exchange of vow, i'll tell thee as we pass, but this i pray: that thou consent to marry us today.
holy saint francis, what a change is here!
is rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, so soon forsaken?
young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears.
lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not washed off yet.
if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, thou and these woes were all for rosaline.
and art thou changed?
pronounce this sentence then: women may fall when there's no strength in men.
thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline.
and badest me bury love.
not in a grave, to lay one in, another out to have.
i pray thee, chide not.
oh, she knew well thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
but come, young waverer, come, go with me, in one respect i'll thy assistant be, for this alliance may so happy prove to turn your households' rancor to pure love.
oh, let us hence.
i stand on sudden haste.
wisely and slow.
they stumble that run fast.
came he not home tonight?
not to his father's.
i spoke with his man.
why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that rosaline, torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
tybalt, the kinsman to old capulet, hath sent a letter to his father's house.
nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
alas, poor romeo!
and is he a man to encounter tybalt?
the slip, sir, the slip.
can you not conceive?
come between us, good benvolio.
my wits faints.
switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or i'll cry a match.
nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, i am done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, i am sure, i have in my whole five.
nay, good goose, bite not.
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting.
it is a most sharp sauce.
and is it not well served into a sweet goose?
oh, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!
i stretch it out for that word "broad," which, added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
now art thou sociable.
now art thou romeo.
oh, thou art deceived.
i would have made it short, for i was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
here's goodly gear.
two, two-a shirt and a smock.
anon!
god ye good e'en, fair gentlewoman.
is it good e'en?
tis no less, i tell you, for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.
what a man are you?
one, gentlewoman, that god hath made, himself to mar.
by my troth, it is well said.
for himself to mar," quoth he?
i can tell you, but young romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him.
very well took, i' faith, wisely, wisely.
romeo, will you come to your father's?
we'll to dinner, thither.
a gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
an he speak any thing against me, i'll take him down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks.
and if i cannot, i'll find those that shall.
i am none of his flirt-gills.
i am none of his skains-mates.
i saw no man use you at his pleasure.
if i had, my weapon should quickly have been out, i warrant you.
i dare draw as soon as another man if i see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side.
scurvy knave!
i protest unto thee- good heart, and i' faith, i will tell her as much.
lord, lord, she will be a joyful woman.
what wilt thou tell her, nurse?
and there she shall at friar lawrence' cell be shrived and married.
and stay, good nurse.
behind the abbey wall within this hour my man shall be with thee and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, which to the high top-gallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night.
be trusty, and i'll quit thy pains.
commend me to thy mistress.
what sayst thou, my dear nurse?
did you ne'er hear say, "two may keep counsel, putting one away"?
warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.-lord, lord!
when 'twas a little prating thing.-oh, there is a nobleman in town, one paris, that would fain lay knife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him.
i anger her sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer man.
but, i'll warrant you, when i say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world.
doth not  ay, nurse, what of that?
both with an  ah, mocker, that's the dog's name.
ay, a thousand times.-peter!
anon!
before and apace.
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse.
that's not so.
oh, she is lame!
love's heralds should be thoughts, which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams, driving back shadows over louring hills.
now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve is three long hours, yet she is not come.
had she affections and warm youthful blood, she would be as swift in motion as a ball.
my words would bandy her to my sweet love, and his to me.
but old folks, many feign as they were dead, unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
o god, she comes.-o honey nurse, what news?
now, good sweet nurse- o lord, why look'st thou sad?
though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.
if good, thou shamest the music of sweet news by playing it to me with so sour a face.
i am aweary.
give me leave awhile.
fie, how my bones ache!
i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news.
is thy news good, or bad?
say either, and i'll stay the circumstance.
let me be satisfied.
is 't good or bad?
well, you have made a simple choice.
you know not how to choose a man.
no, not he, though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare.
he is not the flower of courtesy, but, i'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.
go thy ways, wench.
serve god.
what, have you dined at home?
no, no.
but all this did i know before.
my back a' t' other side.
ah, my back, my back!
i' faith, i am sorry that thou art not well.
sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, i warrant, a virtuous- where is your mother?
how oddly thou repliest!
your love says, like an honest gentleman, 'where is your mother?
o god's lady dear, are you so hot?
marry, come up, i trow.
is this the poultice for my aching bones?
here's such a coil.
have you got leave to go to shrift today?
then hie you hence to friar lawrence's cell.
there stays a husband to make you a wife.
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks.
they'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
hie you to church.
i must another way to fetch a ladder, by the which your love must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
go.
i'll to dinner.
hie you to the cell.
what, drawn, and talk of peace?
i hate the word, as i hate hell, all montagues, and thee.
beat them down!
old montague is come, and flourishes his blade in spite of me.
thou villain capulet!
honest nurse, farewell.
amen, amen.
therefore love moderately.
long love doth so.
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
here comes the lady.
oh, so light a foot will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
ah, juliet, if the measure of thy joy be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more to blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath this neighbor air, and let rich music's tongue unfold the imagined happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter.
conceit, more rich in matter than in words, brags of his substance, not of ornament.
come, come with me, and we will make short work.
i pray thee, good mercutio, let's retire.
thou art like one of those fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says "god send me no need of thee!" and, by the operation of the second cup, draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need.
come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
thou, why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes.
what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling.
thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter?
with another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?
and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling!
by my head, here comes the capulets.
couple it with something.
make it a word and a blow.
mercutio, thou consort'st with romeo.
either withdraw unto some private place, and reason coldly of your grievances, or else depart.
here all eyes gaze on us.
men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze.
i will not budge for no man's pleasure, i.
but i'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
therefore, farewell.
i see thou know'st me not.
boy, this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me.
therefore turn and draw.
and so, good capulet-which name i tender as dearly as my own-be satisfied.
o calm dishonourable, vile submission!
what wouldst thou have with me?
will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?
away, tybalt.
i am hurt.
a plague o' both your houses!
marry, 'tis enough.
where is my page?-go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
courage, man.
the hurt cannot be much.
no, 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door, but 'tis enough, 'twill serve.
ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.
a plague o' both your houses!
zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat to scratch a man to death!
a braggart, a rogue, a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic!
a plague o' both your houses!
they have made worms' meat of me.
o romeo, romeo, brave mercutio is dead!
alive in triumph-and mercutio slain!
thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here shalt with him hence.
stand not amazed.
which way ran he that killed mercutio?
speak, nephew.
were you by when it began?
o noble prince, i can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
o my brother's child!
romeo, he cries aloud, "hold, friends!
friends, part!" and, swifter than his tongue, his agile arm beats down their fatal points, and 'twixt them rushes-underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled.
but by and by comes back to romeo, who had but newly entertained revenge, and to 't they go like lightning, for ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain.
and, as he fell, did romeo turn and fly.
he speaks not true.
romeo slew tybalt.
romeo must not live.
his fault concludes but what the law should end, the life of tybalt.
i have an interest in your hearts' proceeding.
but i'll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine.
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses.
nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses, therefore use none.
bear hence this body and attend our will.
mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties, or, if love be blind, it best agrees with night.
come, civil night, thou sober-suited matron, all in black, and learn me how to lose a winning match played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks, with thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold, think true love acted simple modesty.
come, night.
come, romeo.
come, thou day in night, for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
and when i shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.
the cords that romeo bid thee fetch?
ay me, what news?
ah, welladay!
this torture should be roared in dismal hell.
say thou but "ay," and that bare vowel  than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
i am not i if there be such an  or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "ay." if he be slain, say "ay," or if not, "no." brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
to prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty.
vile earth, to earth resign.
o tybalt, tybalt, the best friend i had!
that ever i should live to see thee dead.
is romeo slaughtered, and is tybalt dead?
my dearest cousin and my dearer lord?
tybalt is gone, and romeo banished.
o god, did romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood?
it did, it did.
alas the day, it did.
o serpent heart hid with a flowering face!
dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
o nature, what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
ah, where's my man?-give me some aqua vitae.- these griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
blistered be thy tongue for such a wish!
upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit, for 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned.
sole monarch of the universal earth, oh, what a beast was i to chide at him!
will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
that villain cousin would have killed my husband.
all this is comfort.
wherefore weep i then?
i would forget it fain, but oh, it presses to my memory, like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds.
tybalt is dead, and romeo banished."
that "banished," that one word "banished" hath slain ten thousand tybalts.
tybalt's death was woe enough, if it had ended there.
or, if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be ranked with other griefs, why followed not, when she said "tybalt's dead," "thy father" or "thy mother," nay, or both, which modern lamentations might have moved?
but with a rearward following tybalt's death, "romeo is banished." to speak that word, is father, mother, tybalt, romeo, juliet, all slain, all dead.
romeo is banished." there is no end, no limit, measure, bound, in that word's death.
no words can that woe sound.
where is my father and my mother, nurse?
weeping and wailing over tybalt's corse.
mine shall be spent when theirs are dry, for romeo's banishment.
take up those cords.-poor ropes, you are beguiled, both you and i, for romeo is exiled.
he made you for a highway to my bed, but i, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
and death, not romeo, take my maidenhead!
i'll find romeo to comfort you.
i'll to him.
he is hid at lawrence' cell.
romeo, come forth.
come forth, thou fearful man.
i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
what less than doomsday is the prince's doom?
ha, banishment!
be merciful, say "death," for exile hath more terror in his look, much more than death.
do not say "banishment." hence from verona art thou banished.
there is no world without verona walls but purgatory, torture, hell itself.
hence "banished" is banished from the world, and world's exile is death.
calling death "banishment," thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax and smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
tis torture and not mercy.
more validity, more honorable state, more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo.
flies may do this, but i from this must fly.
they are free men, but i am banished.
and sayst thou yet that exile is not death?
hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife, no sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, but "banished" to kill me?-"banished"!
o friar, the damned use that word in hell.
howling attends it.
how hast thou the heart, being a divine, a ghostly confessor, a sin-absolver, and my friend professed, to mangle me with that word "banished"?
thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
here were the servants of your adversary, and yours, close fighting ere i did approach.
i drew to part them.
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows, came more and more and fought on part and part, till the prince came, who parted either part.
oh, where is romeo?
saw you him today?
towards him i made, but he was 'ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood.
many a morning hath he there been seen, with tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
but all so soon as the all-cheering sun should in the farthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora's bed, away from light steals home my heavy son,
oh, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
oh, then i see that madmen have no ears.
wert thou as young as i, juliet thy love, an hour but married, tybalt murdered, doting like me, and like me banished, then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair and fall upon the ground, as i do now, taking the measure of an unmade grave.
arise.
one knocks.
not i, unless the breath of heartsick groans, mistlike, infold me from the search of eyes.
what's your will?
o holy friar, o, tell me, holy friar, where is my lady's lord?
where's romeo?
oh, he is even in my mistress' case, just in her case.
o woeful sympathy, piteous predicament!
stand, an you be a man.
for juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
why should you fall into so deep an o?
ah sir, ah sir.
death's the end of all.
and how doth she?
and what says my concealed lady to our canceled love?
as if that name, shot from the deadly level of a gun, did murder her, as that name's cursed hand murdered her kinsman.
o, tell me, friar, tell me, in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge?
tell me, that i may sack the hateful mansion.
thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast.
thou hast amazed me.
by my holy order, i thought thy disposition better tempered.
why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit, which, like a usurer, abound'st in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
thy juliet is alive, for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead- there art thou happy.
tybalt would kill thee, but thou slew'st tybalt-there art thou happy.
the law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile-there art thou happy.
a pack of blessings light upon thy back, happiness courts thee in her best array,
but, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.
ascend her chamber, hence, and comfort her.
o lord, i could have stayed here all the night to hear good counsel.
oh, what learning is!
here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
how well my comfort is revived by this!
go hence.
and here stands all your state: either be gone before the watch be set, or by the break of day disguised from hence.
i'll find out your man, and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that chances here.
things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, that we have had no time to move our daughter.
look you, she loved her kinsman tybalt dearly, and so did i.
these times of woe afford no time to woo.
i will, and know her mind early tomorrow.
tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness.
sir paris, i will make a desperate tender of my child's love.
acquaint her here of my son paris' love, and bid her, mark you me, on wednesday next- but, soft!
what day is this?
ha, ha.
we'll keep no great ado, a friend or two.
for, hark you, tybalt being slain so late, it may be thought we held him carelessly, being our kinsman, if we revel much.
therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends, and there an end.
my lord, i would that thursday were tomorrow.
well get you gone.
o' thursday be it, then.- go you to juliet ere you go to bed.
it was the nightingale, and not the lark, that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
yon light is not daylight, i know it, i.
it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torchbearer, and light thee on thy way to mantua.
therefore stay yet.
thou need'st not to be gone.
let me be ta'en.
let me be put to death.
i am content, so thou wilt have it so.
let's talk.
it is not day.
it is, it is.
some say the lark makes sweet division.
this doth not so, for she divideth us.
more light and light it grows.
more light and light, more dark and dark our woes!
madam.
the day is broke.
then, window, let day in and let life out.
farewell, farewell.
one kiss, and i'll descend.
and private in his chamber pens himself, shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, and makes himself an artificial night.
have you importuned him by any means?
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift.-come, madam, let's away.
art thou gone so, love, lord?
oh, by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo.
oh, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
o god, i have an ill-divining soul.
methinks i see thee now, thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
adieu, adieu!
o fortune, fortune!
all men call thee fickle.
be fickle, fortune, for then, i hope, thou wilt not keep him long, but send him back.
who is 't that calls?
is it my lady mother?
what unaccustomed cause procures her hither?
evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
an if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
therefore, have done.
some grief shows much of love, but much of grief shows still some want of wit.
feeling so the loss, cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death, as that the villain lives which slaughtered him.
that same villain, romeo.
would none but i might venge my cousin's death!
i'll send to one in mantua, where that same banished runagate doth live, shall give him such an unaccustomed dram that he shall soon keep tybalt company.
and then, i hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
indeed, i never shall be satisfied with romeo, till i behold him-dead- is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed.
madam, if you could find out but a man to bear a poison, i would temper it, that romeo should, upon receipt thereof, soon sleep in quiet.
to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that slaughtered him!
find thou the means, and i'll find such a man.
but now i'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
what are they, beseech your ladyship?
well, well, thou hast a careful father, child.
madam, in happy time, what day is that?
marry, my child, early next thursday morn, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman, the county paris, at saint peter's church, shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
now, by saint peter's church and peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride.
i wonder at this haste, that i must wed ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
i pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, i will not marry yet.
and when i do, i swear it shall be romeo, whom you know i hate, rather than paris.
a conduit, girl?
what, still in tears, evermore showering?
how, will she none?
doth she not count her blessed, unworthy as she is, that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bride?
how, how, how, how?
chopped logic!
proud," and "i thank you," and "i thank you not," and yet "not proud"?
out, you green sickness, carrion!
you tallow face!
what, are you mad?
good father, i beseech you on my knees, hear me with patience but to speak a word.
speak not.
reply not.
do not answer me.
smatter with your gossips, go.
oh, god 'i' good e'en.
utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl, for here we need it not.
god's bread!
day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, alone, in company, still my care hath been to have her matched.
thursday is near.
lay hand on heart, advise.
an you be mine, i'll give you to my friend.
trust to 't, bethink you.
i'll not be forsworn.
delay this marriage for a month, a week.
or, if you do not, make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies.
talk not to me, for i'll not speak a word.
o god!-o nurse, how shall this be prevented?
how shall that faith return again to earth, unless that husband send it me from heaven by leaving earth?
comfort me.
oh, he's a lovely gentleman.
romeo's a dishclout to him.
beshrew my very heart, i think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first.
or if it did not, your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were, as living here and you no use of him.
speakest thou from thy heart?
well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.
go in, and tell my lady i am gone, having displeased my father, to lawrence's cell to make confession and to be absolved.
marry, i will, and this is wisely done.
i'll to the friar to know his remedy.
if all else fail, myself have power to die.
you say you do not know the lady's mind.
i like it not.
happily met, my lady and my wife.
good morrow, cousin.
not having that which, having, makes them short.
out.
of love?
where shall we dine?-o me!
that "may be" must be, love, on thursday next.
what must be shall be.
that's a certain text.
come you to make confession to this father?
if i do so, it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face.
poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.
my leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.- my lord, we must entreat the time alone.
god shield i should disturb devotion!- juliet, on thursday early will i rouse ye.
o juliet, i already know thy grief.
i hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, on thursday next be married to this county.
tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, unless thou tell me how i may prevent it.
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, do thou but call my resolution wise, and with this knife i'll help it presently.
wednesday is tomorrow.
tomorrow night look that thou lie alone.
let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
no warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.
love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.
farewell, dear father.
you shall have none ill, sir, for i'll try if they can lick their fingers.
go, be gone.
we shall be much unfurnished for this time.
where i have learned me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests, and am enjoined by holy lawrence to fall prostrate here to beg your pardon.
send for the county.
i'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.
i met the youthful lord at lawrence' cell, and gave him what becomed love i might, not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
why, i am glad on 't.
ay, marry, go, i say, and fetch him hither.- now, afore god, this reverend holy friar!
our whole city is much bound to him.
nurse, will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
we'll to church tomorrow.
i'll not to bed tonight.
let me alone.
i'll play the housewife for this once.
ay, those attires are best.
for, i am sure, you have your hands full all in this so sudden business.
farewell!-god knows when we shall meet again.
shall i be married then tomorrow morning?
oh, look!
methinks i see my cousin's ghost seeking out romeo, that did spit his body upon a rapier's point.
romeo, romeo, romeo!
here's drink.
i drink to thee.
why, such is love's transgression.
and if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
tut, i have lost myself.
i am not here.
tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
groan!
why, no.
but sadly, tell me who.
hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
the second cock hath crowed.
the curfew bell hath rung.
spare not for the cost.
go, you cot-quean, go.
get you to bed, faith.
you'll be sick tomorrow for this night's watching.
i have watched ere now all night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time, but i will watch you from such watching now.
now, fellow, what is there?
make haste, make haste, sirrah.
i have a head, sir, that will find out logs, and never trouble peter for the matter.
mass, and well said.
a merry whoreson, ha!
thou shalt be loggerhead.-good faith, 'tis day.
what, ho?
what, nurse, i say!
go waken juliet.
go and trim her up.
i'll go and chat with paris.
hie, make haste, make haste.
the bridegroom he is come already.
make haste, i say.
what, mistress!
juliet!-fast, i warrant her, she.- why, lamb!
why, lady!
why, love, i say.
sweet-heart!
you take your pennyworths now.
how sound is she asleep!
ay, let the county take you in your bed.
he'll fright you up, i' faith.
look, look.
my child, my only life, revive, look up, or i will die with thee!- help, help!
for shame, bring juliet forth.
her lord is come.
she's dead, deceased, she's dead.
alack the day.
she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
ha?
let me see her.
out, alas!
she's cold.
her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.
life and these lips have long been separated.
o woeful time.
come, is the bride ready to go to church?
death is my son-in-law.
death is my heir.
my daughter he hath wedded.
i will die, and leave him all.
life, living, all is death's.
have i thought long to see this morning's face, and doth it give me such a sight as this?
accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
most miserable hour that e'er time saw in lasting labor of his pilgrimage.
but one, poor one, one poor and loving child, but one thing to rejoice and solace in, and cruel death hath catched it from my sight!
o woeful day, o woeful day!
beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
most detestable death, by thee beguiled, by cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown!
not life, but love in death.
despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!
uncomfortable time, why camest thou now to murder, murder our solemnity?
my soul, and not my child!
dead art thou!
confusion's cure lives not in these confusions.
heaven and yourself had part in this fair maid.
now heaven hath all,
and all the better is it for the maid.
the most you sought was her promotion, for 'twas your heaven she should be advanced.
and weep ye now, seeing she is advanced above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
oh, in this love, you love your child so ill that you run mad, seeing that she is well.
she's not well married that lives married long, but she's best married that dies married young.
our instruments to melancholy bells, our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast.
our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change, our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, and all things change them to the contrary.
the heavens do lour upon you for some ill. move them no more by crossing their high will.
not a dump, we.
no money, on my faith, but the gleek.
i will give you the minstrel.
then i will give you the serving creature.
then will i lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate.
then have at you with my wit.
prates too.-what say you, james soundpost?
it is "music with her silver sound" because musicians have no gold for sounding.
what a pestilent knave is this same!
how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
news from verona!-how now, balthasar?
her body sleeps in capels' monument, and her immortal part with angels lives.
i saw her laid low in her kindred's vault and presently took post to tell it you.
a sick man in sadness makes his will, a word ill urged to one that is so ill.
and she's fair i love.
she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, for beauty, starved with her severity, cuts beauty off from all posterity.
be ruled by me.
forget to think of her.
thou know'st my lodging.
get me ink and paper, and hire post horses.
i will hence tonight.
your looks are pale and wild, and do import some misadventure.
tush, thou art deceived.
get thee gone, and hire those horses.
i'll be with thee straight.
well, juliet, i will lie with thee tonight.
let's see for means.
being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
apothecary!
i see that thou art poor.
hold, there is forty ducats.
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, and fear'st to die?
famine is in thy cheeks.
need and oppression starveth in thine eyes.
the world is not thy friend nor the world's law.
the world affords no law to make thee rich.
buy food, and get thyself in flesh.- come, cordial and not poison, go with me to juliet's grave, for there must i use thee.
holy franciscan friar!
brother, ho!
so that my speed to mantua there was stayed.
brother, i'll go and bring it thee.
now must i to the monument alone.
within this three hours will fair juliet wake.
but i will write again to mantua, and keep her at my cell till romeo come.
poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
yet put it out, for i would not be seen.
yet i will adventure.
what cursed foot wanders this way tonight to cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
what with a torch!
muffle me, night, awhile.
good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.
fly hence and leave me.
think upon these gone.
let them affright thee.
stay not, be gone.
live, and hereafter say a madman's mercy bid thee run away.
i do defy thy commination and apprehend thee for a felon here.
open the tomb.
mercutio's kinsman, noble county paris.
what said my man, when my betossed soul did not attend him as we rode?
or did i dream it so?
i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
a grave?
oh, no.
a lantern, slaughtered youth, for here lies juliet, and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light.
death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
thou art not conquered.
o, what more favor can i do to thee, than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy?
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous, and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour?
here, here will i remain with worms that are thy chamber maids.
oh, here will i set up my everlasting rest, and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
eyes, look your last.
arms, take your last embrace.
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows, being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
how oft tonight have my old feet stumbled at graves!-who's there?
here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
as i discern, it burneth in the capels' monument.
i dare not, sir.
stay, then.
i'll go alone.
oh, much i fear some ill unthrifty thing.
romeo!- alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains the stony entrance of the sepulcher?
o comfortable friar!
where is my lord?
lady, come from that nest of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead, and paris too.
come, i'll dispose of thee among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
poison, i see, hath been his timeless end.- o churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after?
haply some poison yet doth hang on them, to make me die with a restorative.
then i'll be brief.
o happy dagger, this is thy sheath.
there rust and let me die.
this is the place.
there, where the torch doth burn.
the ground is bloody.-search about the churchyard.
here lies the county slain, and juliet bleeding, warm and newly dead, who here hath lain these two days buried.- go, tell the prince.
run to the capulets.
raise up the montagues.
some others search.
here's romeo's man.
here is a friar that trembles, sighs and weeps.
we took this mattock and this spade from him as he was coming from this churchyard's side.
a great suspicion.
what misadventure is so early up that calls our person from our morning rest?
what should it be that is so shrieked abroad?
oh, the people in the street cry "romeo," some "juliet," and some "paris," and all run with open outcry toward our monument.
this dagger hath mista'en-for, lo, his house is empty on the back of montague, and it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.
this sight of death is as a bell, that warns my old age to a sepulcher.
alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath.
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring, their head, their true descent, and then will i be general of your woes, and lead you even to death.
meantime forbear, and let mischance be slave to patience.- bring forth the parties of suspicion.
i am the greatest, able to do least, yet most suspected, as the time and place doth make against me, of this direful murder.
and here i stand, both to impeach and purge, myself condemned and myself excused.
meantime i writ to romeo, that he should hither come as this dire night, to help to take her from her borrowed grave, being the time the potion's force should cease.
their course of love, the tidings of her death.
montague!
but saying o'er what i have said before.
my child is yet a stranger in the world.
she hath not seen the change of fourteen years.
and too soon marred are those so early made.
but woo her, gentle paris, get her heart.
this night i hold an old accustomed feast, whereto i have invited many a guest such as i love.
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of star-crossed lovers take their life, whose misadventured piteous overthrows doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
the fearful passage of their death-marked love and the continuance of their parents' rage, which, but their children's end, naught could remove, is now the two hours' traffic of our stage- the which, if you with patient ears attend, what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
such comfort as do lusty young men feel when well-appareled april on the heel of limping winter treads.
even such delight among fresh fennel buds shall you this night inherit at my house.
go, sirrah, trudge about through fair verona.
find them out whose names are written here?
it is written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.
but i am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ.
why romeo, art thou mad?
not mad, but bound more than a madman is, shut up in prison, kept without my food, whipped and tormented and-good e'en, good fellow.
god 'i' good e'en.
but i pray, can you read anything you see?
ay, if i know the letters and the language.
stay, fellow.
i can read.
seigneur martino and his wife and daughters; county anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady widow of vitruvio; seigneur placentio and his lovely nieces; mercutio and his brother valentine; mine uncle capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece rosaline and livia;
seigneur valentio and his cousin tybalt; lucio and the lively helena." a fair assembly.
whither?
to supper?
my master's.
indeed, i should have asked thee that before.
now i'll tell you without asking.
my master is the great rich capulet, and if you be not of the house of montagues, i pray come and crush a cup of wine.
at this same ancient feast of capulet's sups the fair rosaline whom thou so loves with all the admired beauties of verona.
i'll go along, no such sight to be shown, but to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
nurse, where's my daughter?
now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old i bade her come.
how now, who calls?
thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
she's not fourteen.
i'll lay fourteen of my teeth-and yet, to my teen be it spoken, i have but four-she is not fourteen.
susan and she-god rest all christian souls!- were of an age.
well, susan is with god.
she was too good for me.
but, as i said, on lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen.
that shall she.
marry, i remember it well.
tis since the earthquake now eleven years, and she was weaned-i never shall forget it- of all the days of the year, upon that day.
for i had then laid wormwood to my dug, sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
my lord and you were then at mantua.- nay, i do bear a brain.-but, as i said, when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
shake!" quoth the dovehouse.
twas no need, i trow, to bid me trudge.
yea," quoth he, "dost thou fall upon thy face?
and, pretty fool, it stinted and said "ay." enough of this.
i pray thee, hold thy peace.
yes, madam.
yet i cannot choose but laugh to think it should leave crying and say "ay." and yet, i warrant, it had upon its brow a bump as big as a young cockerel's stone, a perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
yea," quoth my husband, "fall'st upon thy face?
thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age.
wilt thou not, jule?" it stinted and said "ay." and stint thou too, i pray thee, nurse, say i.
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nursed.
it is an honor that i dream not of.
younger than you here in verona, ladies of esteem are made already mothers.
verona's summer hath not such a flower.
i'll look to like if looking liking move.
but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
i must hence to wait.
i beseech you, follow straight.
we follow thee.-juliet, the county stays.
go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
but let them measure us by what they will.
give me a torch.
i am not for this ambling.
you have dancing shoes with nimble soles.
i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move.
borrow cupid's wings and soar with them above a common bound.
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers, and so bound, i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
under love's heavy burden do i sink.
i mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
to move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
a dog of that house shall move me to stand.
and to sink in it, should you burthen love- too great oppression for a tender thing.
it is too rough, too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
if love be rough with you, be rough with love.
let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels.
come, we burn daylight, ho!
nay, that's not so.
we waste our lights in vain, like lights by day.
and we mean well in going to this mask, but 'tis no wit to go.
i dreamt a dream tonight.
in bed asleep while they do dream things true.
oh, then, i see queen mab hath been with you.
sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, and then dreams he of smelling out a suit.
and sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep, then he dreams of another benefice.
this is she- ???peace, peace, mercutio, peace!
this wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves.
on, lusty gentlemen.
strike, drum.
where's potpan, that he helps not to take away?
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands, and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in susan grindstone and nell.-antony and potpan!
you are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.
we cannot be here and there too.
cheerly, boys.
be brisk 0awhile, and the longer liver take all.
she that makes dainty, she, i'll swear, hath corns.
am i come near ye now?- welcome, gentlemen!
tis more, 'tis more.
his son is elder, sir.
his son is thirty.
oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
this, by his voice, should be a montague.-   what, dares the slave come hither, covered with an antic face, to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
uncle, this is a montague, our foe, a villain that is hither come in spite to scorn at our solemnity this night.
content thee, gentle coz.
let him alone.
he bears him like a portly gentleman, and, to say truth, verona brags of him to be a virtuous and well-governed youth.
i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement.
therefore be patient.
take no note of him.
you'll not endure him!
why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
go to, go to.
is 't so, indeed?
this trick may chance to scathe you, i know what.
you must contrary me.
i'll make you quiet.-what, cheerly, my hearts!
o, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.
they pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
then move not, while my prayer's effect i take.
thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.
sin from thy lips?
you kiss by th' book.
i nursed her daughter that you talked withal.
i tell you, he that can lay hold of her shall have the chinks.
nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.
we have a trifling foolish banquet towards.- is it e'en so?
i'll to my rest.
the quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
i will show myself a tyrant.
the heads of the maids?
they must take it in sense that feel it.
me they shall feel while i am able to stand, and 'tis known i am a pretty piece of flesh.
tis well thou art not fish.
draw thy tool!
what is yond gentleman?
what's he that now is going out of door?
go ask his name.-if he be married.
what's this?
what's this?
the strangers all are gone.
now romeo is beloved and loves again, alike bewitched by the charm of looks, but to his foe supposed he must complain, and she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
and she as much in love, her means much less to meet her new beloved anywhere.
but passion lends them power, time means, to meet, tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
he ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.
nay, i'll conjure too!
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh!
speak but one rhyme, and i am satisfied.
cry but "ay me!" pronounce but "love" and "dove." speak to my gossip venus one fair word, one nickname for her purblind son and heir, young abraham cupid, he that shot so true when king cophetua loved the beggar maid.- he heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.
my invocation is fair and honest.
now will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone.- o romeo, that she were!
go, then, for 'tis in vain to seek him here that means not to be found.
it is the east, and juliet is the sun.
cast it off!
it is my lady.
oh, it is my love.
oh, that she knew she were!
her eye discourses.
tis not to me she speaks.
her eye in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night.
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
oh, that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek!
wherefore art thou romeo?
tis but thy name that is my enemy.
henceforth i never will be romeo.
what man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, so stumblest on my counsel?
art thou not romeo, and a montague?
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb, and the place death, considering who thou art, if any of my kinsmen find thee here.
therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
if they do see thee they will murder thee.
my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
i know thou wilt say "ay," and i will take thy word.
do not swear at all.
or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, which is the god of my idolatry, and i'll believe thee.
if my heart's dear love- well, do not swear.
although i joy in thee, i have no joy of this contract tonight.
this bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast.
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it, and yet i would it were to give again.
wouldst thou withdraw it?
my bounty is as boundless as the sea, my love as deep.
dear love, adieu.- anon, good nurse!-sweet montague, be true.
stay but a little.
i will come again.
o blessed, blessed night!
i am afeard, being in night, all this is but a dream, too flattering sweet to be substantial.
let us take the law of our sides.
let them begin.
nay, as they dare.
i will bite my thumb at them, which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
tomorrow will i send.
a thousand times the worse to want thy light.
bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud, else would i tear the cave where echo lies, and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, with repetition of "my romeo!" it is my soul that calls upon my name.
how silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, like softest music to attending ears!
my nyas?
what o'clock tomorrow shall i send to thee?
tis twenty year till then.
and i'll still stay, to have thee still forget, forgetting any other home but this.
tis almost morning.
and yet no further than a wanton's bird, that lets it hop a little from his hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, and with a silken thread plucks it back again, so loving-jealous of his liberty.
parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night till it be morrow.
sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
would i were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.
hence will i to my ghostly friar's close cell, his help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
the gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, and fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels.
now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, the day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, i must upfill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
the earth, that's nature's mother, is her tomb.
and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find, many for many virtues excellent, none but for some and yet all different.
oh, mickle is the powerful grace that lies in herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities.
for naught so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give.
virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, and vice sometime by action dignified.
within the infant rind of this small flower poison hath residence and medicine power.
two such opposed kings encamp them still, in man as well as herbs-grace and rude will.
and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
good morrow, father.
benedicite.
care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, and where care lodges, sleep will never lie.
but where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uproused by some distemperature.
or if not so, then here i hit it right: our romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
that last is true.
the sweeter rest was mine.
with rosaline, my ghostly father?
that's my good son.
but where hast thou been, then?
i'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies.
i bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, my intercession likewise steads my foe.
now old desire doth in his deathbed lie, and young affection gapes to be his heir; that fair for which love groan'd for and would die, with tender juliet match'd, is now not fair.
now romeo is belov'd, and loves again, alike bewitched by the charm of looks; but to his foe suppos'd he must complain, and she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
no, for then we should be colliers.
i mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
ay, while you live, draw your neck out of the collar.
a dog of the house of montague moves me.
when i have fought with the men, i will be civil with the maids; i will cut off their heads.
tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor-john.
how?
turn thy back and run?
no, marry.
i fear thee!
let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
no, sir, i do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but i bite my thumb, sir.
but if you do, sir, i am for you.
say 'better.' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
yes, better, sir.
beat them down!
give me my long sword, ho!
a crutch, a crutch!
why call you for a sword?
old montague is come and flourishes his blade in spite of me.
thou villain capulet!-hold me not, let me go.
rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, profaners of this neighbour-stained steel- will they not hear?
three civil brawls, bred of an airy word by thee, old capulet, and montague, have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets and made verona's ancient citizens cast by their grave beseeming ornaments to wield old partisans, in hands as old, canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.
if ever you disturb our streets again, your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
here were the servants of your adversary and yours, close fighting ere i did approach.
o, where is romeo?
saw you him to-day?
i, measuring his affections by my own, which then most sought where most might not be found, being one too many by my weary self- pursu'd my humour, not pursuing his, and gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
have you importun'd him by any means?
both by myself and many other friends; but he, his own affections' counsellor, is to himself-i will not say how true- but to himself so secret and so close, so far from sounding and discovery, as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift.
come, madam, let's away, good morrow, cousin.
ay me!
sad hours seem long.
what sadness lengthens romeo's hours?
not having that, which, having, makes them short.
out- of love?
out of her favour, where i am in love.
alas that love, so gentle in his view, should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
alas that love, whose view is muffled still, should without eyes see pathways to his will!
where shall we dine?
what fray was here?
yet tell me not, for i have heard it all.
o loving hate!
o any thing, of nothing first create!
o heavy lightness!
serious vanity!
misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
this love feel i, that feel no love in this.
dost thou not laugh?
at thy good heart's oppression.
why, such is love's transgression.
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest with more of thine.
this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs; being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
an if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
tut!
tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
groan?
why, no; but sadly tell me who.
i aim'd so near when i suppos'd you lov'd.
and she's fair i love.
she will not stay the siege of loving terms, nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes, nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
o, she's rich in beauty; only poor that, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; for beauty, starv'd with her severity, cuts beauty off from all posterity.
she hath forsworn to love, and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now.
be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
tis the way to call hers, exquisite, in question more.
show me a mistress that is passing fair, what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who pass'd that passing fair?
thou canst not teach me to forget.
i'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
but montague is bound as well as i, in penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, i think, for men so old as we to keep the peace.
of honourable reckoning are you both, and pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
and too soon marr'd are those so early made.
the earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; she is the hopeful lady of my earth.
but woo her, gentle paris, get her heart; my will to her consent is but a part.
this night i hold an old accustom'd feast, whereto i have invited many a guest, such as i love; and you among the store, one more, most welcome, makes my number more.
at my poor house look to behold this night earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
such comfort as do lusty young men feel when well-apparell'd april on the heel of limping winter treads, even such delight among fresh female buds shall you this night inherit at my house.
hear all, all see, and like her most whose merit most shall be; which, amongst view of many, mine, being one, may stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
come, go with me.
it is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but i am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ.
i must to the learned.
in good time!
for your broken shin.
why, romeo, art thou mad?
not mad, but bound more than a madman is; shut up in prison, kept without my food, whipp'd and tormented and- god-eve, good fellow.
but i pray, can you read any thing you see?
ay, if i know the letters and the language.
stay, fellow; i can read.
whither to supper?
my master's.
indeed, i should have ask'd you that before.
now i'll tell you without asking.
my master is the great rich capulet; and if you be not of the house of montagues, i pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
at this same ancient feast of capulet's sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lov'st; with all the admired beauties of verona.
i'll go along, no such sight to be shown, but to rejoice in splendour of my own.
nurse, where's my daughter?
now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old, i bade her come.
what ladybird!
god forbid!
where's this girl?
what, juliet!
this is the matter-nurse, give leave awhile, we must talk in secret.
nurse, come back again; i have remember'd me, thou shalt hear our counsel.
thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
she's not fourteen.
i'll lay fourteen of my teeth- and yet, to my teen be it spoken, i have but four- she is not fourteen.
how long is it now to lammastide?
a fortnight and odd days.
susan and she (god rest all christian souls!
were of an age.
well, susan is with god; she was too good for me.
but, as i said, on lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen; that shall she, marry; i remember it well.
tis since the earthquake now eleven years; and she was wean'd (i never shall forget it), of all the days of the year, upon that day; for i had then laid wormwood to my dug, sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
nay, i do bear a brain.
a' was a merry man) took up the child.
yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
i warrant, an i should live a thousand years, i never should forget it.
yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
peace, i have done.
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nurs'd.
marry, that 'marry' is the very theme i came to talk of.
it is an honour that i dream not of.
younger than you, here in verona, ladies of esteem, are made already mothers.
lady, such a man as all the world- why he's a man of wax.
verona's summer hath not such a flower.
nay, he's a flower, in faith-a very flower.
can you love the gentleman?
the fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride for fair without the fair within to hide.
that book in many's eyes doth share the glory, that in gold clasps locks in the golden story; so shall you share all that he doth possess, by having him making yourself no less.
no less?
nay, bigger!
women grow by men.
speak briefly, can you like of paris' love?
i'll look to like, if looking liking move; but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd, my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and everything in extremity.
we follow thee.
juliet, the county stays.
go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
you have dancing shoes with nimble soles; i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move.
borrow cupid's wings and soar with them above a common bound.
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers; and so bound i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
under love's heavy burden do i sink.
and, to sink in it, should you burden love- too great oppression for a tender thing.
it is too rough, too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
give me a case to put my visage in.
a visor for a visor!
what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities?
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
come, knock and enter; and no sooner in but every man betake him to his legs.
a torch for me!
let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels; for i am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase, i'll be a candle-holder and look on; the game was ne'er so fair, and i am done.
dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
nay, that's not so.
i mean, sir, in delay we waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
take our good meaning, for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits.
and we mean well, in going to this mask; but 'tis no wit to go.
i dreamt a dream to-night.
in bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
o, then i see queen mab hath been with you.
sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, of breaches, ambuscadoes, spanish blades, of healths five fathom deep; and then anon drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, and being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two and sleeps again.
this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, that presses them and learns them first to bear, making them women of good carriage.
true, i talk of dreams; which are the children of an idle brain, begot of nothing but vain fantasy; which is as thin of substance as the air, and more inconstant than the wind, who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
but he, that hath the steerage of my course, direct my sail!
on, lusty gentlemen!
strike, drum.
where's potpan, that he helps not to take away?
he shift a trencher!
he scrape a trencher!
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as thou lovest me, let the porter let in susan grindstone and nell.
you are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and sought for, in the great chamber.
ladies that have their toes unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
ah ha, my mistresses!
which of you all will now deny to dance?
she that makes dainty, she, i'll swear, hath corns.
am i come near ye now?
you are welcome, gentlemen!
come, musicians, play.
a hall, a hall!
give room!
ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
what, man?
tis since the nuptial of lucentio, come pentecost as quickly as it will, some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
tis more, 'tis more!
his son is elder, sir; his son is thirty.
what lady's that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?
o, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an ethiop's ear- beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
the measure done, i'll watch her place of stand and, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
did my heart love till now?
forswear it, sight!
this, by his voice, should be a montague.
fetch me my rapier, boy.
what, dares the slave come hither, cover'd with an antic face, to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
now, by the stock and honour of my kin, to strike him dead i hold it not a sin.
why, how now, kinsman?
uncle, this is a montague, our foe; a villain, that is hither come in spite to scorn at our solemnity this night.
content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
he bears him like a portly gentleman, and, to say truth, verona brags of him to be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
i would not for the wealth of all this town here in my house do him disparagement.
therefore be patient, take no note of him.
it is my will; the which if thou respect, show a fair presence and put off these frowns, an ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
it fits when such a villain is a guest.
what, goodman boy?
am i the master here, or you?
go to!
you'll not endure him?
you will set cock-a-hoop!
you'll be the man!
why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
go to, go to!
is't so, indeed?
you must contrary me!
i'll make you quiet; what!-cheerly, my hearts!
patience perforce with wilful choler meeting makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
i will withdraw; but this intrusion shall, now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.
if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which mannerly devotion shows in this; for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
then move not while my prayer's effect i take.
thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.
sin from my lips?
o trespass sweetly urg'd!
you kiss by th' book.
marry, bachelor, her mother is the lady of the house.
and a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
is she a capulet?
o dear account!
my life is my foe's debt.
away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
ay, so i fear; the more is my unrest.
more torches here!
come on then, let's to bed.
ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late; i'll to my rest.
what is yon gentleman?
what's he that now is going out of door?
what's he that follows there, that would not dance?
his name is romeo, and a montague, the only son of your great enemy.
my only love, sprung from my only hate!
too early seen unknown, and known too late!
prodigious birth of love it is to me that i must love a loathed enemy.
what's this?
what's this?
a rhyme i learn'd even now of one i danc'd withal.
anon, anon!
come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse; in half an hour she promis'd to return.
that's not so.
o, she is lame!
love's heralds should be thoughts, which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love, and therefore hath the wind-swift cupid wings.
now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve is three long hours; yet she is not come.
o god, she comes!
o honey nurse, what news?
now, good sweet nurse-o lord, why look'st thou sad?
what a jaunt have i had!
i would thou hadst my bones, and i thy news.
jesu, what haste!
is thy news good or bad?
say either, and i'll stay the circumstance.
let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
romeo?
he is not the flower of courtesy, but, i'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.
go thy ways, wench; serve god.
what, have you din'd at home?
lord, how my head aches!
what a head have i!
it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
my back o' t' other side,-ah, my back, my back!
beshrew your heart for sending me about to catch my death with jaunting up and down!
i' faith, i am sorry that thou art not well.
sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome; and, i warrant, a virtuous-where is your mother?
how oddly thou reply'st!
your love says, like an honest gentleman, "where is your mother?"' o god's lady dear!
are you so hot?
here's such a coil!
have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
then hie you hence to friar laurence' cell; there stays a husband to make you a wife.
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks: they'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
hie you to church; i must another way, to fetch a ladder, by the which your love must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
i am the drudge, and toil in your delight; but you shall bear the burden soon at night.
go; i'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
honest nurse, farewell.
turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
he ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
nay, i'll conjure too.
humours!
madman!
passion!
lover!
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh; speak but one rhyme, and i am satisfied!
cry but 'ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove'; speak to my gossip venus one fair word, one nickname for her purblind son and heir, young adam cupid, he that shot so trim when king cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
he heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not; the ape is dead, and i must conjure him.
twould anger him to raise a spirit in his mistress' circle of some strange nature, letting it there stand till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
that were some spite; my invocation is fair and honest: in his mistress' name, i conjure only but to raise up him.
come, he hath hid himself among these trees to be consorted with the humorous night.
now will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
romeo, good night.
i'll to my truckle-bed; this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
come, shall we go?
go then, for 'tis in vain 'to seek him here that means not to be found.
he jests at scars that never felt a wound.
but soft!
what light through yonder window breaks?
it is the east, and juliet is the sun!
arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she.
be not her maid, since she is envious.
cast it off.
it is my lady; o, it is my love!
o that she knew she were!
i am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
what if her eyes were there, they in her head?
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night.
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
o that i were a glove upon that hand, that i might touch that cheek!
ay me!
she speaks.
o, speak again, bright angel!
for thou art as glorious to this night, being o'er my head, as is a winged messenger of heaven unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air.
shall i hear more, or shall i speak at this?
o, be some other name!
what's in a name?
that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
so romeo would, were he not romeo call'd, retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title.
romeo, doff thy name; and for that name, which is no part of thee, take all myself.
i take thee at thy word.
call me but love, and i'll be new baptiz'd; henceforth i never will be romeo.
what man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night, so stumblest on my counsel?
my name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee.
had i it written, i would tear the word.
my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words of that tongue's utterance, yet i know the sound.
how cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
if they do see thee, they will murder thee.
alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords!
i have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; and but thou love me, let them find me here.
my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
by whose direction found'st thou out this place?
i am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far as that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea, i would adventure for such merchandise.
thou knowest the mask of night is on my face; else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
fain would i dwell on form, fain, fain deny what i have spoke; but farewell complement!
i know thou wilt say 'ay'; and i will take thy word.
yet, if thou swear'st, thou mayst prove false.
at lovers' perjuries, they say jove laughs.
o gentle romeo, if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
i should have been more strange, i must confess, but that thou overheard'st, ere i was ware, my true love's passion.
therefore pardon me, and not impute this yielding to light love, which the dark night hath so discovered.
lady, by yonder blessed moon i swear, that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops- o, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, that monthly changes in her circled orb, lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
do not swear at all; or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, which is the god of my idolatry, and i'll believe thee.
if my heart's dear love- well, do not swear.
this bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast!
what satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it; and yet i would it were to give again.
would'st thou withdraw it?
my bounty is as boundless as the sea, my love as deep; the more i give to thee, the more i have, for both are infinite.
dear love, adieu!
anon, good nurse!
sweet montague, be true.
stay but a little, i will come again.
o blessed, blessed night!
i am afeard, being in night, all this is but a dream, too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
if that thy bent of love be honourable, thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, by one that i'll procure to come to thee, where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; and all my fortunes at thy foot i'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world.
i come, anon.-but if thou meanest not well, i do beseech thee- madam!
by-and-by, i come.- to cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
to-morrow will i send.
a thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; but love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
romeo, hist!
o for a falconer's voice to lure this tassel-gentle back again!
bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud; else would i tear the cave where echo lies, and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine with repetition of my romeo's name.
it is my soul that calls upon my name.
how silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, like softest music to attending ears!
my dear?
what o'clock to-morrow shall i send to thee?
tis twenty years till then.
i shall forget, to have thee still stand there, remembering how i love thy company.
and i'll still stay, to have thee still forget, forgetting any other home but this.
parting is such sweet sorrow, that i shall say good night till it be morrow.
sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
would i were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
hence will i to my ghostly father's cell, his help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
the grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night, check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light; and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels.
now, ere the sun advance his burning eye the day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, i must up-fill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
the earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
what is her burying grave, that is her womb; and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find; many for many virtues excellent, none but for some, and yet all different.
virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, and vice sometime's by action dignified.
two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs-grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
good morrow, father.
benedicite!
care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, and where care lodges sleep will never lie; but where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature; or if not so, then here i hit it right- our romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
that last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
god pardon sin!
wast thou with rosaline?
with rosaline, my ghostly father?
i have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
i'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
i have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me that's by me wounded.
holy saint francis!
what a change is here!
is rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, so soon forsaken?
young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
how much salt water thrown away in waste, to season love, that of it doth not taste!
if e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, thou and these woes were all for rosaline.
and art thou chang'd?
pronounce this sentence then: women may fall when there's no strength in men.
thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline.
and bad'st me bury love.
not in a grave to lay one in, another out to have.
i pray thee chide not.
she whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
but come, young waverer, come go with me.
wisely, and slow.
they stumble that run fast.
came he not home to-night?
why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad.
tybalt, the kinsman to old capulet, hath sent a letter to his father's house.
nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
alas, poor romeo, he is already dead!
more than prince of cats, i can tell you.
o, he's the courageous captain of compliments.
he fights as you sing pricksong, keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom!
ah, the immortal passado!
the punto reverso!
the hai!
the pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-these new tuners of accent!
by jesu, a very good blade!
a very tall man!
o, their bones, their bones!
there's a french salutation to your french slop.
you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
that's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
meaning, to curtsy.
thou hast most kindly hit it.
a most courteous exposition.
pink for flower.
right.
why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
well said!
follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, solely singular.
o single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
or i'll cry a match.
nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, i am done; for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, i am sure, i have in my whole five.
nay, good goose, bite not!
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
and is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
o, here's a wit of cheverel, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!
i stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
now art thou sociable, now art thou romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
stop there, stop there!
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
here's goodly gear!
a sail, a sail!
anon.
good peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of the two.
god ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
is it good-den?
tis no less, i tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.
what a man are you!
one, gentlewoman, that god hath made for himself to mar.
i can tell you; but young romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him.
if you be he, sir, i desire some confidence with you.
a bawd, a bawd, a bawd!
an old hare hoar, and an old hare hoar, is very good meat in lent; but a hare that is hoar is too much for a score when it hoars ere it be spent.
romeo, will you come to your father's?
we'll to dinner thither.
marry, farewell!
i pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery?
a gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
an' a speak anything against me, i'll take him down, an' a were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if i cannot, i'll find those that shall.
and thou must stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
i dare draw as soon as another man, if i see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.
i pro- test unto thee- good heart, and i' faith i will tell her as much.
what wilt thou tell her, nurse?
bid her devise some means to come to shrift this afternoon; and there she shall at friar laurence' cell be shriv'd and married.
here is for thy pains.
no, truly, sir; not a penny.
this afternoon, sir?
well, she shall be there.
and stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
within this hour my man shall be with thee and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, which to the high topgallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night.
what say'st thou, my dear nurse?
did you ne'er hear say, two may keep counsel, putting one away?
i warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.
lord, lord!
when 'twas a little prating thing-o, there is a nobleman in town, one paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him.
i anger her sometimes, and tell her that paris is the properer man; but i'll warrant you, when i say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world.
doth not rosemary and romeo begin both with a letter?
ay, nurse; what of that?
both with an r. ah, mocker!
that's the dog's name.
ay, a thousand times.
exit romeo.
anon.
peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
so smile the heavens upon this holy act that after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
amen, amen!
do thou but close our hands with holy words, then love-devouring death do what he dare- it is enough i may but call her mine.
these violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die, like fire and powder, which, as they kiss, consume.
the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness and in the taste confounds the appetite.
here comes the lady.
o, so light a foot will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
ah, juliet, if the measure of thy joy be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more to blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath this neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue unfold the imagin'd happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter.
come, come with me, and we will make short work; for, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone till holy church incorporate two in one.
i pray thee, good mercutio, let's retire.
thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says 'god send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
thou!
why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
thy head is as full of quar rels as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling.
thou hast quar rell'd with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.
and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
by my head, here come the capulets.
follow me close, for i will speak to them.
and but one word with one of us?
couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
mercutio, thou consortest with romeo.
but i'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
your worship in that sense may call him man.
therefore farewell.
i see thou knowest me not.
boy, this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
o calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
alla stoccata carries it away.
tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
what would'st thou have with me?
will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears?
come, sir, your passado!
gentlemen, for shame!
forbear this outrage!
tybalt, mercutio, the prince expressly hath forbid this bandying in verona streets.
hold, tybalt!
good mercutio!
where is my page?
go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
no, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve.
ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man.
a plague o' both your houses!
zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death!
a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic!
a plague o' both your houses!
they have made worms' meat of me.
that gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds, which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
away to heaven respective lenity, and fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
now, tybalt, take the 'villain' back again that late thou gavest me; for mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads, staying for thine to keep him company.
thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, shalt with him hence.
stand not amaz'd.
o, i am fortune's fool!
which way ran he that kill'd mercutio?
o my brother's child!
o prince!
o husband!
o, the blood is spill'd of my dear kinsman!
prince, as thou art true, for blood of ours, shed blood of montague.
tybalt, here slain, whom romeo's hand did slay.
romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink how nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal your high displeasure.
romeo he cries aloud, 'hold, friends!
romeo slew tybalt; romeo must not live.
not romeo, prince; he was mercutio's friend; his fault concludes but what the law should end, the life of tybalt.
and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence.
i have an interest in your hate's proceeding, my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding; but i'll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine.
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses; nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
therefore use none.
let romeo hence in haste, else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
bear hence this body, and attend our will.
mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, towards phoebus' lodging!
such a wagoner as phaeton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately.
spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, that runaway eyes may wink, and romeo leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
come, civil night, thou sober-suited matron, all in black, and learn me how to lose a winning match, play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks, with thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold, think true love acted simple modesty.
come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night; give me my romeo; and, when he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.
o, i have bought the mansion of a love, but not possess'd it; and though i am sold, not yet enjoy'd.
so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
what hast thou there?
the cords that romeo bid thee fetch?
ay me!
what news?
ah, well-a-day!
he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
who ever would have thought it?
this torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
say thou but 'i,' and that bare vowel 'i' shall poison more than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
i am not i, if there be such an 'i'; or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'i.' if he be slain, say 'i'; or if not, 'no.' brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
here on his manly breast.
o, break, my heart!
poor bankrout, break at once!
vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here, and thou and romeo press one heavy bier!
o courteous tybalt!
what storm is this that blows so contrary?
is romeo slaught'red, and is tybalt dead?
my dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
for who is living, if those two are gone?
tybalt is gone, and romeo banished; romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
o god!
did romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood?
o serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
beautiful tyrant!
fiend angelical!
dove-feather'd raven!
wolvish-ravening lamb!
despised substance of divinest show!
just opposite to what thou justly seem'st- a damned saint, an honourable villain!
o nature, what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
o, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace!
there's no trust, no faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd, all forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
ah, where's my man?
give me some aqua vitae.
these griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
blister'd be thy tongue for such a wish!
upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit; for 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd sole monarch of the universal earth.
o, what a beast was i to chide at him!
will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband?
ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name when i, thy three-hours' wife, have mangled it?
that villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
your tributary drops belong to woe, which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
my husband lives, that tybalt would have slain; and tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
some word there was, worser than tybalt's death, that murdered me.
i would forget it fain; but o, it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
tybalt is dead, and romeo banished.' that 'banished,' that one word 'banished,' hath slain ten thousand tybalts.
but with a rearward following tybalt's death, 'romeo is banished'- to speak that word is father, mother, tybalt, romeo, juliet, all slain, all dead.
where is my father and my mother, nurse?
weeping and wailing over tybalt's corse.
mine shall be spent, when theirs are dry, for romeo's banishment.
take up those cords.
poor ropes, you are beguil'd, both you and i, for romeo is exil'd.
he made you for a highway to my bed; but i, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
i'll find romeo to comfort you.
i'll to him; he is hid at laurence' cell.
o, find him!
give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell.
romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
affliction is enamour'd of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity.
what is the prince's doom?
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand that i yet know not?
i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
what less than doomsday is the prince's doom?
a gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips- not body's death, but body's banishment.
ha, banishment?
be merciful, say 'death'; for exile hath more terror in his look, much more than death.
do not say 'banishment.' hence from verona art thou banished.
there is no world without verona walls, but purgatory, torture, hell itself.
calling death 'banishment,' thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe and smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, and turn'd that black word death to banishment.
this is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
tis torture, and not mercy.
heaven is here, where juliet lives; and every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy thing, live here in heaven and may look on her; but romeo may not.
more validity, more honourable state, more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo.
this may flies do, when i from this must fly; they are free men, but i am banished.
and sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
o, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
yet 'banished'?
unless philosophy can make a juliet, displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, it helps not, it prevails not.
o, then i see that madmen have no ears.
wert thou as young as i, juliet thy love, an hour but married, tybalt murdered, doting like me, and like me banished, then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, and fall upon the ground, as i do now, taking the measure of an unmade grave.
not i; unless the breath of heartsick groans, mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
hark, how they knock!
who's there?
what's your will?
welcome, then.
there on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
o, he is even in my mistress' case, just in her case!
o woeful sympathy!
piteous predicament!
nurse- ah sir!
ah sir!
well, death's the end of all.
doth not she think me an old murderer, now i have stain'd the childhood of our joy with blood remov'd but little from her own?
and how doth she?
and what says my conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
o, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; and now falls on her bed, and then starts up, and tybalt calls; and then on romeo cries, and then down falls again.
as if that name, shot from the deadly level of a gun, did murder her; as that name's cursed hand murdered her kinsman.
o, tell me, friar, tell me, in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge?
tell me, that i may sack the hateful mansion.
hold thy desperate hand.
or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
thou hast amaz'd me.
by my holy order, i thought thy disposition better temper'd.
wilt thou slay thyself?
and slay thy lady that in thy life lives, by doing damned hate upon thyself?
why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet in thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
thy noble shape is but a form of wax digressing from the valour of a man; thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish; thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, misshapen in the conduct of them both, like powder in a skilless soldier's flask, is set afire by thine own ignorance, and thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
tybalt would kill thee, but thou slewest tybalt.
there art thou happy too.
the law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend and turns it to exile.
there art thou happy.
take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
go get thee to thy love, as was decreed, ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
but look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to mantua, where thou shalt live till we can find a time to blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
go before, nurse.
o lord, i could have stay'd here all the night to hear good counsel.
o, what learning is!
my lord, i'll tell my lady you will come.
here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
how well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
i'll find out your man, and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that chances here.
but that a joy past joy calls out on me, it were a grief so brief to part with thee.
farewell.
things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily that we have had no time to move our daughter.
look you, she lov'd her kinsman tybalt dearly, and so did i.
i promise you, but for your company, i would have been abed an hour ago.
these times of woe afford no tune to woo.
i will, and know her mind early to-morrow; to-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
sir paris, i will make a desperate tender of my child's love.
i think she will be rul'd in all respects by me; nay more, i doubt it not.
what day is this?
ha, ha!
well, wednesday is too soon.
thursday let it be- a thursday, tell her she shall be married to this noble earl.
will you be ready?
we'll keep no great ado- a friend or two; for hark you, tybalt being slain so late, it may be thought we held him carelessly, being our kinsman, if we revel much.
therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends, and there an end.
my lord, i would that thursday were to-morrow.
well, get you gone.
a thursday be it then.
afore me, it is so very very late that we may call it early by-and-by.
good night.
believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
it was the lark, the herald of the morn; no nightingale.
look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
i must be gone and live, or stay and die.
yon light is not daylight; i know it, i.
it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torchbearer and light thee on thy way to mantua.
therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
i'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, 'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow; nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
juliet wills it so.
how is't, my soul?
it is, it is!
some say the lark makes sweet division; this doth not so, for she divideth us.
more light and light-more dark and dark our woes!
then, window, let day in, and let life out.
farewell, farewell!
one kiss, and i'll descend.
i must hear from thee every day in the hour, for in a minute there are many days.
o, by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo!
o, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
i doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our time to come.
methinks i see thee, now thou art below, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
o fortune, fortune!
all men call thee fickle.
if thou art fickle, what dost thou with him that is renown'd for faith?
be fickle, fortune, for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back.
ho, daughter!
are you up?
who is't that calls?
it is my lady mother.
is she not down so late, or up so early?
what unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
an if thou could'st, thou could'st not make him live.
therefore have done.
some grief shows much of love; but much of grief shows still some want of wit.
feeling so the loss, i cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death as that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
that same villain romeo.
villain and he be many miles asunder.
god pardon him!
i do, with all my heart; and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
would none but i might venge my cousin's death!
we will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
i'll send to one in mantua, where that same banish'd runagate doth live, shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram that he shall soon keep tybalt company; and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied.
indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold him- dead - is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
madam, if you could find out but a man to bear a poison, i would temper it; that romeo should, upon receipt thereof, soon sleep in quiet.
o, how my heart abhors to hear him nam'd and cannot come to him, to wreak the love i bore my cousin tybalt upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
find thou the means, and i'll find such a man.
but now i'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
what are they, i beseech your ladyship?
well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; one who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects not, nor i look'd not for.
marry, my child, early next thursday morn the gallant, young, and noble gentleman, the county paris, at saint peter's church, shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew, but for the sunset of my brother's son it rains downright.
a conduit, girl?
what, still in tears?
evermore show'ring?
how now, wife?
take me with you, take me with you, wife.
doth she not count her blest, unworthy as she is, that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
proud can i never be of what i hate, but thankful even for hate that is meant love.
how, how, how, how, choplogic?
out, you green-sickness carrion!
you tallow-face!
what, are you mad?
hang thee, young baggage!
disobedient wretch!
i tell thee what-get thee to church a thursday or never after look me in the face.
speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
my fingers itch.
wife, we scarce thought us blest that god had lent us but this only child; but now i see this one is one too much, and that we have a curse in having her.
utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl, for here we need it not.
god's bread!
graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: an you be mine, i'll give you to my friend; an you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, for, by my soul, i'll ne'er acknowledge thee, nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
trust to't.
bethink you.
i'll not be forsworn.
is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief?
o sweet my mother, cast me not away!
delay this marriage for a month, a week; or if you do not, make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies.
talk not to me, for i'll not speak a word.
how shall that faith return again to earth unless that husband send it me from heaven by leaving earth?
alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself!
what say'st thou?
faith, here it is.
romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you; or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
then, since the case so stands as now it doth, i think it best you married with the county.
o, he's a lovely gentleman!
romeo's a dishclout to him.
beshrew my very heart, i think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead-or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use of him.
speak'st thou this from thy heart?
and from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
go in; and tell my lady i am gone, having displeas'd my father, to laurence' cell, to make confession and to be absolv'd.
marry, i will; and this is wisely done.
ancient damnation!
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath prais'd him with above compare so many thousand times?
i'll to the friar to know his remedy.
if all else fail, myself have power to die.
my father capulet will have it so, and i am nothing slow to slack his haste.
you say you do not know the lady's mind.
uneven is the course; i like it not.
immoderately she weeps for tybalt's death, and therefore have i little talk'd of love; for venus smiles not in a house of tears.
now, sir, her father counts it dangerous that she do give her sorrow so much sway, and in his wisdom hastes our marriage to stop the inundation of her tears, which, too much minded by herself alone, may be put from her by society.
i would i knew not why it should be slow'd.
happily met, my lady and my wife!
that may be must be, love, on thursday next.
come you to make confession to this father?
if i do so, it will be of more price, being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
the tears have got small victory by that, for it was bad enough before their spite.
thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
that is no slander, sir, which is a truth; and what i spake, i spake it to my face.
thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
it may be so, for it is not mine own.
are you at leisure, holy father, now, or shall i come to you at evening mass?
my leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
my lord, we must entreat the time alone.
god shield i should disturb devotion!
juliet, on thursday early will i rouse ye.
till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.
o, shut the door!
i hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, on thursday next be married to this county.
tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, unless thou tell me how i may prevent it.
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife i'll help it presently.
therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time, give me some present counsel; or, behold, 'twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire, arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honour bring.
be not so long to speak.
i long to die if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
hold, daughter.
i do spy a kind of hope, which craves as desperate an execution as that is desperate which we would prevent.
if, rather than to marry county paris, thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, then is it likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame, that cop'st with death himself to scape from it; and, if thou dar'st, i'll give thee remedy.
go home, be merry, give consent to marry paris.
wednesday is to-morrow.
now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
in the mean time, against thou shalt awake, shall romeo by my letters know our drift; and hither shall he come; and he and i will watch thy waking, and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua.
o, tell not me of fear!
hold!
i'll send a friar with speed to mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
love give me strength!
and strength shall help afford.
farewell, dear father.
so many guests invite as here are writ.
sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
you shall have none ill, sir; for i'll try if they can lick their fingers.
marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers.
go, begone.
we shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
what, is my daughter gone to friar laurence?
well, be may chance to do some good on her.
a peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
how now, my headstrong?
where have you been gadding?
where i have learnt me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests, and am enjoin'd by holy laurence to fall prostrate here to beg your pardon.
pardon, i beseech you!
henceforward i am ever rul'd by you.
send for the county.
i'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
i met the youthful lord at laurence' cell and gave him what becomed love i might, not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
why, i am glad on't.
this is as't should be.
let me see the county.
ay, marry, go, i say, and fetch him hither.
now, afore god, this reverend holy friar, all our whole city is much bound to him.
nurse, will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
go, nurse, go with her.
we'll to church to-morrow.
we shall be short in our provision.
they are all forth; well, i will walk myself to county paris, to prepare him up against to-morrow.
my heart is wondrous light, since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
no, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries as are behoveful for our state to-morrow.
so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you; for i am sure you have your hands full all in this so sudden business.
get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
god knows when we shall meet again.
i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life.
i'll call them back again to comfort me.
nurse!- what should she do here?
shall i be married then to-morrow morning?
no, no!
this shall forbid it.
what if it be a poison which the friar subtly hath ministr'd to have me dead, lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd because he married me before to romeo?
i will not entertain so bad a thought.
how if, when i am laid into the tomb, i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me?
there's a fearful point!
shall i not then be stifled in the vault, to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, and there die strangled ere my romeo comes?
o, look!
methinks i see my cousin's ghost seeking out romeo, that did spit his body upon a rapier's point.
romeo, i come!
this do i drink to thee.
hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
the second cock hath crow'd, the curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
look to the bak'd meats, good angelica; spare not for cost.
faith, you'll be sick to-morrow for this night's watching.
no, not a whit.
ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; but i will watch you from such watching now.
now, fellow, what is there?
things for the cook, sir; but i know not what.
make haste, make haste.
sirrah, fetch drier logs.
call peter; he will show thee where they are.
i have a head, sir, that will find out logs and never trouble peter for the matter.
mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
thou shalt be loggerhead.good faith,'tis day.
the county will be here with music straight, for so he said he would.
i hear him near.
what, nurse, i say!
i'll go and chat with paris.
hie, make haste, make haste!
what, mistress!
juliet!
fast, i warrant her, she.
why, lamb!
why, lady!
fie, you slug-abed!
why, love, i say!
madam!
sweetheart!
you take your pennyworths now!
sleep for a week; for the next night, i warrant, the county paris hath set up his rest that you shall rest but little.
god forgive me!
i needs must wake her.
madam, madam, madam!
ay, let the county take you in your bed!
i must needs wake you.
lady!
lady!
lady!
alas, alas!
help, help!
my lady's dead!
o well-a-day that ever i was born!
some aqua-vitae, ho!
my lord!
my lady!
look, look!
my child, my only life!
revive, look up, or i will die with thee!
help, help!
call help.
for shame, bring juliet forth; her lord is come.
she's dead, deceas'd; she's dead!
alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
ha!
let me see her.
out alas!
o woful time!
o son, the night before thy wedding day hath death lain with thy wife.
see, there she lies, flower as she was, deflowered by him.
i will die and leave him all.
life, living, all is death's.
have i thought long to see this morning's face, and doth it give me such a sight as this?
accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
most miserable hour that e'er time saw in lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
but one, poor one, one poor and loving child, but one thing to rejoice and solace in, and cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
most lamentable day, most woeful day that ever ever i did yet behold!
o day!
o day!
o day!
o hateful day!
o woeful day!
o woeful day!
beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
not life, but love in death!
despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now to murder, murder our solemnity?
o child!
o child!
my soul, and not my child!
dead art thou, dead!
alack, my child is dead, and with my child my joys are buried!
confusion's cure lives not in these confusions.
o, in this love, you love your child so ill that you run mad, seeing that she is well.
dry up your tears and stick your rosemary on this fair corse, and, as the custom is, in all her best array bear her to church; for though fond nature bids us all lament, yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; and go, sir paris.
not a dump we!
then will i give you the serving-creature.
then will i lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
i'll re you, i'll fa you.
do you note me?
an you re us and fa us, you note us.
pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
then have at you with my wit!
i will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.
pretty!
what say you, hugh rebeck?
i say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.
pretty too!
what say you, james soundpost?
o, i cry you mercy!
you are the singer.
it is 'music with her silver sound' because musi- cians have no gold for sounding.
then music with her silver sound with speedy help doth lend redress.' what a pestilent knave is this same!
come, we'll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.
my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne, and all this day an unaccustom'd spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead (strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!
and breath'd such life with kisses in my lips that i reviv'd and was an emperor.
how sweet is love itself possess'd, when but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
news from verona!
how now, balthasar?
her body sleeps in capels' monument, and her immortal part with angels lives.
i saw her laid low in her kindred's vault and presently took post to tell it you.
thou knowest my lodging.
get me ink and paper and hire posthorses.
i will hence to-night.
your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
tush, thou art deceiv'd.
get thee gone and hire those horses.
i'll be with thee straight.
well, juliet, i will lie with thee to-night.
let's see for means.
i do remember an apothecary, and hereabouts he dwells, which late i noted in tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows, culling of simples.
meagre were his looks, sharp misery had worn him to the bones; and in his needy shop a tortoise hung, an alligator stuff'd, and other skins of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes, green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
noting this penury, to myself i said, 'an if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua, here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.' o, this same thought did but forerun my need, and this same needy man must sell it me.
being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
apothecary!
let me have a dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the life-weary taker may fall dead, and that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath as violently as hasty powder fir'd doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
such mortal drugs i have; but mantua's law is death to any he that utters them.
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness and fearest to die?
my poverty but not my will consents.
i pay thy poverty and not thy will.
put this in any liquid thing you will and drink it off, and if you had the strength of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
i sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
buy food and get thyself in flesh.
holy franciscan friar, brother, ho!
going to find a barefoot brother out, one of our order, to associate me here in this city visiting the sick, and finding him, the searchers of the town, suspecting that we both were in a house where the infectious pestilence did reign, seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth, so that my speed to mantua there was stay'd.
i could not send it-here it is again- nor get a messenger to bring it thee, so fearful were they of infection.
by my brotherhood, the letter was not nice, but full of charge, of dear import; and the neglecting it may do much danger.
brother, i'll go and bring it thee.
she will beshrew me much that romeo hath had no notice of these accidents; but i will write again to mantua, and keep her at my cell till romeo come- poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!
whistle then to me, as signal that thou hear'st something approach.
i am almost afraid to stand alone here in the churchyard; yet i will adventure.
the obsequies that i for thee will keep nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
what cursed foot wanders this way to-night to cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
what, with a torch?
muffle me, night, a while.
hold, take this letter.
early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father.
why i descend into this bed of death is partly to behold my lady's face, but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring-a ring that i must use in dear employment.
but if thou, jealous, dost return to pry in what i further shall intend to do, by heaven, i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
the time and my intents are savage-wild, more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
for all this same, i'll hide me hereabout.
his looks i fear, and his intents i doubt.
thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth, thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open, and in despite i'll cram thee with more food.
this is that banish'd haughty montague that murdered my love's cousin-with which grief it is supposed the fair creature died- and here is come to do some villanous shame to the dead bodies.
i will apprehend him.
stop thy unhallowed toil, vile montague!
can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
condemned villain, i do apprehend thee.
obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
by heaven, i love thee better than myself, for i come hither arm'd against myself.
live, and hereafter say a madman's mercy bid thee run away.
i do defy thy conjuration and apprehend thee for a felon here.
o, i am slain!
if thou be merciful, open the tomb, lay me with juliet.
in faith, i will.
let me peruse this face.
mercutio's kinsman, noble county paris!
what said my man when my betossed soul did not attend him as we rode?
or did i dream it so?
or am i mad, hearing him talk of juliet to think it was so?
o, give me thy hand, one writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
o, no, a lantern, slaughtr'd youth, for here lies juliet, and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light.
death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry!
which their keepers call a lightning before death.
o, how may i call this a lightning?
o my love!
my wife!
death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
thou art not conquer'd.
beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, and death's pale flag is not advanced there.
tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
o, what more favour can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy?
forgive me, cousin.
ah, dear juliet, why art thou yet so fair?
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous, and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour?
for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again.
here, here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids.
o, here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
eyes, look your last!
arms, take your last embrace!
and, lips, o you the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!
thou desperate pilot, now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
here's to my love!
drinks.
how oft to-night have my old feet stumbled at graves!
who's there?
here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
as i discern, it burneth in the capels' monument.
it doth so, holy sir; and there's my master, one that you love.
stay then; i'll go alone.
o, much i fear some ill unlucky thing.
what mean these masterless and gory swords to lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
o, pale!
who else?
what, paris too?
and steep'd in blood?
ah, what an unkind hour is guilty of this lamentable chance!
the lady stirs.
o comfortable friar!
where is my lord?
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; and paris too.
come, i'll dispose of thee among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
come, go, good juliet.
i dare no longer stay.
go, get thee hence, for i will not away.
what's here?
a cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
poison, i see, hath been his timeless end.
o churl!
drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after?
haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make me die with a restorative.
thy lips are warm!
lead, boy.
which way?
then i'll be brief.
o happy dagger!
go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
here lies the county slain; and juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, who here hath lain this two days buried.
we see the ground whereon these woes do lie, but the true ground of all these piteous woes we cannot without circumstance descry.
here's romeo's man.
here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
we took this mattock and this spade from him as he was coming from this churchyard side.
a great suspicion!
what misadventure is so early up, that calls our person from our morning rest?
what should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
the people in the street cry 'romeo,' some 'juliet,' and some 'paris'; and all run, with open outcry, toward our monument.
what fear is this which startles in our ears?
sovereign, here lies the county paris slain; and romeo dead; and juliet, dead before, warm and new kill'd.
here is a friar, and slaughter'd romeo's man, with instruments upon them fit to open these dead men's tombs.
this dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house is empty on the back of montague, and it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a sepulchre.
come, montague; for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down.
alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
o thou untaught!
what manners is in this, to press before thy father to a grave?
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring, their head, their true descent; and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death.
meantime forbear, and let mischance be slave to patience.
bring forth the parties of suspicion.
i am the greatest, able to do least, yet most suspected, as the time and place doth make against me, of this direful murder; and here i stand, both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excus'd.
romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet; and she, there dead, that romeo's faithful wife.
i married them; and their stol'n marriage day was tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city; for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pin'd.
you, to remove that siege of grief from her, betroth'd and would have married her perforce to county paris.
then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage, or in my cell there would she kill herself.
then gave i her (so tutored by my art) a sleeping potion; which so took effect as i intended, for it wrought on her the form of death.
meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave, being the time the potion's force should cease.
but he which bore my letter, friar john, was stay'd by accident, and yesternight return'd my letter back.
then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred's vault; meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo.
but when i came, some minute ere the time of her awaking, here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead.
we still have known thee for a holy man.
where's romeo's man?
i brought my master news of juliet's death; and then in post he came from mantua to this same place, to this same monument.
this letter he early bid me give his father, and threat'ned me with death, going in the vault, if i departed not and left him there.
give me the letter.
i will look on it.
where is the county's page that rais'd the watch?
sirrah, what made your master in this place?
he came with flowers to strew his lady's grave; and bid me stand aloof, and so i did.
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; and by-and-by my master drew on him; and then i ran away to call the watch.
where be these enemies?
capulet, montage, see what a scourge is laid upon your hate, that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
and i, for winking at you, discords too, have lost a brace of kinsmen.
all are punish'd.
this is my daughter's jointure, for no more can i demand.
as rich shall romeo's by his lady's lie- poor sacrifices of our enmity!
a glooming peace this morning with it brings.
the sun for sorrow will not show his head.
