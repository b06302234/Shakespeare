Enter Cleon , Strato , Lysippus , Diphilus .
The rest are making ready Sir .
So let them , there 's time enough .
You are the brother to the King , my Lord , we 'll take your word .
Strato , thou hast some skill in Poetry , Whatthinkst thou of a Mask ? will it be well ?
As well as Mask can be .
As Mask can be ?
Yes , they must commend their King , and speakin praise of the Assembly , bless the Bride andBridegroom , in person of some God ; th'are tyedto rules of flattery .
See , good my Lord , who is return 'd !
Noble Melantius ! [ Enter Melantius.The Land by me welcomes thy vertues home to Rhodes , thou that with blood abroad buyest us our peace ; thebreath of King is like the breath of Gods ; My brotherwisht thee here , and thou art here ; he will be too kind , and weary thee with often welcomes ; but the time dothgive thee a welcome above this or all the worlds .
My Lord , my thanks ; but these scratcht limbs of mine havespoke my love and truth unto my friends , more than mytongue ere could : my mind 's the same it ever was to you ; where I find worth , I love the keeper , till he let it go , And then I follow it .
Hail worthy brother ! He that rejoyces not at your returnIn safety , is mine enemy for ever .
I thank thee Diphilus : but thou art faulty ; I sent for thee to exercise thine armesWith me at Patria : thou cam'st not Diphilus : 'Twasill .
My noble brother , my excuseIs my King 's strict command , which you my LordCan witness with me .
'T is true Melantius , He might not come till the solemnityOf this great match were past .
Have you heard of it ?
Yes , I have given cause to those thatEnvy my deeds abroad , to call me gamesome ; I have no other business here at Rhodes .
We have a Mask to night , And you must tread a Soldiers measure .
These soft and silken wars are not for me ; The Musick must be shrill , and all confus 'd , That stirs my blood , and then I dance with armes : But is Amintor Wed ?
This day .
All joyes upon him , for he is my friend : Wonder not that I call a man so young my friend , His worth is great ; valiant he is , and temperate , And one that never thinks his life his own , If his friend need it : when he was a boy , As oft as I return 'd ( as without boast ) I brought home conquest , he would gaze upon me , And view me round , to find in what one limbThe vertue lay to do those things he heard : Then would he wish to see my Sword , and feelThe quickness of the edge , and in his handWeigh it ; he oft would make me smile at this ; His youth did promise much , and his ripe yearsWill see it all perform'd. [ Enter Aspatia , passing by .
Hail Maid and Wife ! Thou fair Aspatia , may the holy knotThat thou hast tyed to day , last till the handOf age undo't ; may'st thou bring a raceUnto Amintor that may fill the worldSuccessively with Souldiers .
My hard fortunesDeserve not scorn ; for I was never proudWhen they were good. [ Exit Aspatia .
How 's this ?
You are mistaken , for she is not married .
You said Amintor was .
'T is true ; but
Pardon me , I did receiveLetters at Patria , from my Amintor , That he should marry her .
And so it stood , In all opinion long ; but your arrivalMade me imagine you had heard the change .
Who hath he taken then ?
A Lady Sir , That bears the light above her , and strikes deadWith flashes of her eye ; the fair Evadne yourvertuous Sister .
Peace of heart betwixt them : but this is strange .
The King my brother did itTo honour you ; and these solemnitiesAre at his charge .
'T is Royal , like himself ; But I am sad , my speech bears so unfortunate a soundTo beautiful Aspatia ; there is rageHid in her fathers breast ; CalianaxBent long against me , and he should not think , If I could call it back , that I would takeSo base revenges , as to scorn the stateOf his neglected daughter : holds he still his greatnesswith the King ?
Yes ; but this LadyWalks discontented , with her watry eyesBent on the earth : the unfrequented woodsAre her delight ; and when she sees a bankStuck full of flowers , she with a sigh will tellHer servants what a pretty place it wereTo bury lovers in , and make her maidsPluck'em , and strow her over like a Corse.She carries with her an infectious griefThat strikes all her beholders , she will singThe mournful'st things that ever ear hath heard , And sigh , and sing again , and when the restOf our young Ladies in their wanton blood , Tell mirthful tales in course that fill the roomWith laughter , she will with so sad a lookBring forth a story of the silent deathOf some forsaken Virgin , which her griefWill put in such a phrase , that ere she end , She'l send them weeping one by one away .
She has a brother under my commandLike her , a face as womanish as hers , But with a spirit that hath much out-grownThe number of his years. [ Enter Amintor .
My Lord the Bridegroom !
I might run fiercely , not more hastilyUpon my foe : I love thee well Amintor , My mouth is much too narrow for my heart ; I joy to look upon those eyes of thine ; Thou art my friend , but my disorder 'd speech cuts offmy love .
Thou art Melantius ; All love is spoke in that , a sacrificeTo thank the gods , Melantius is return'dIn safety ; victory sits on his swordAs she was wont ; may she build there and dwell , And may thy Armour be as it hath been , Only thy valour and thy innocence.What endless treasures would our enemies give , That I might hold thee still thus !
I am but poor in words , but credit me young man , Thy Mother could no more but weep , for joy to see theeAfter long absence ; all the wounds I have , Fetch not so much away , nor all the cryesOf Widowed Mothers : but this is peace ; And what was War ?
Pardon thou holy GodOf Marriage bed , and frown not , I am forc'tIn answer of such noble tears as those , To weep upon my Wedding day .
I fear thou art grown too sick ; for I hearA Lady mourns for thee , men say to death , Forsaken of thee , on what terms I know not .
She had my promise , but the King forbad it , And made me make this worthy change , thy SisterAccompanied with graces above her , With whom I long to lose my lusty youth , And grow old in her arms .
Be prosperous. [ Enter Messenger .
My Lord , the Maskers rage for you .
We are gone. Cleon , Strata , Diphilus .
Wee'l all attend you , we shall trouble youWith our solemnities .
Not so Amintor.But if you laugh at my rude carriageIn peace , I'le do as much for you in WarWhen you come thither : yet I have a MistressTo bring to your delights ; rough though I am , I have a Mistress , and she has a heart , She saies , but trust me , it is stone , no better , There is no place that I can challenge in't.But you stand still , and here my way lies. [ Exit .
Diagoras , look to the doors better for shame , you letin all the world , and anon the King will rail at me ; whyvery well said , by Jove the King will have the showi'th ' Court .
Why do you swear so my Lord ? You know he'l have it here .
By this light if he be wise he will not .
And if he will not be wise , you are forsworn .
One may wear his heart out with swearing , and getthanks on no side , I'le be gone , look to't who will .
My Lord , I will never keep them out.Pray stay , your looks will terrifie them .
My looks terrifie them , you Coxcombly Ass you ! I'le be judg 'd by all the company whether thou hast not aworse face than I --
I mean , because they know you and your Office .
Office ! I would I could put it off , I am sure I sweatquite through my Office , I might have made room at myDaughters Wedding , they had near kill 'd her among them.And now I must do service for him that hath forsaken her ; serve that will. [ Exit Calianax .
He 's so humourous since his daughter was forsaken : hark , hark , there , there , so , so , codes , codes.What now ? [ Within. knock within .
Open the door .
Who 's there ?
Melantius .
I hope your Lordship brings no troop with you , for if you do , I must return them. [ Enter Melantius .
None but this Lady Sir. [ And a Lady .
The Ladies are all plac 'd above , save those thatcome in the Kings Troop , the best of Rhodes sit there , and there 's room .
I thank you Sir : when I have seen you plac'dMadam , I must attend the King ; but the Mask done , I'lewait on you again .
Stand back there , room for my Lord Melantius , pray bearback , this is no place for such youths and their Truls , let the doors shut agen ; I , do your heads itch ? I'lescratch them for you : so now thrust and hang : again , who is't now ? I can not blame my Lord Calianax forgoing away ; would he were here , he would run ragingamong them , and break a dozen wiser heads than hisown in the twinkling of an eye : what 's the news now ? [ Within.I pray can you help me to the speech of the Master Cook ?
If I open the door I'le cook some of your Calvesheads.Peace Rogues. -- again , -- who is't ?
Melantius within. Enter Calianax to Melantius .
Let him not in .
O my Lord I must ; make room there for myLord ; is your Lady plac't ?
Yes Sir , I thank you my Lord Calianax : well met , Your causless hate to me I hope is buried .
Yes , I do service for your Sister here , That brings my own poor Child to timeless death ; She loves your friend Amintor , such anotherfalse-hearted Lord as you .
You do me wrong , A most unmanly one , and I am slowIn taking vengeance , but be well advis 'd .
It may be so : who placed the Lady there so nearthe presence of the King ?
I did .
My Lord she must not sit there .
Why ?
The place is kept for women of more worth .
More worth than she ? it mis-becomes your AgeAnd place to be thus womanish ; forbear ; What you have spoke , I am content to thinkThe Palsey shook your tongue to .
Why 't is well if I stand here to place mens wenches .
I shall forget this place , thy Age , my safety , andthrough all , cut that poor sickly week thou hast tolive , away from thee .
Nay , I know you can fight for your Whore .
Bate the King , and be he flesh and blood , He lyes that saies it , thy mother at fifteenWas black and sinful to her .
Good my Lord !
Some god pluck threescore years from that fond man , That I may kill him , and not stain mine honour ; It is the curse of Souldiers , that in peaceThey shall be brain 'd by such ignoble men , As ( if the Land were troubled ) would with tearsAnd knees beg succour from 'em : would that blood ( That sea of blood ) that I have lost in fight , Were running in thy veins , that it might make theeApt to say less , or able to maintain , Shouldst thou say more , -- This Rhodes I see is noughtBut a place priviledg 'd to do men wrong .
I , you may say your pleasure. [ Enter Amintor .
What vilde injuryHas stirr 'd my worthy friend , who is as slowTo fight with words , as he is quick of hand ?
That heap of age which I should reverenceIf it were temperate : but testy yearsAre most contemptible .
Good Sir forbear .
There is just such another as your self .
He will wrong you , or me , or any man , And talk as if he had no life to loseSince this our match : the King is coming in , I would not for more wealth than I enjoy , He should perceive you raging , he did hearYou were at difference now , which hastned him .
Make room there .
Melantius , thou art welcome , and my loveIs with thee still ; but this is not a placeTo brabble in ; Calianax , joyn hands .
He shall not have my hand .
This is no timeTo force you to't , I do love you both:
, you look well to your Office ; And you Melantius are welcome home ; begin the Mask .
Sister , I joy to see you , and your choice , You lookt with my eyes when you took that man ; Be happy in him. [ Recorders .
O my dearest brother ! Your presence is more joyful than this day can be untome .
Our raign is come ; for in the raging SeaThe Sun is drown 'd , and with him fell the day : Bright Cinthia hear my voice , I am the NightFor whom thou bear'st about thy borrowed light ; Appear , no longer thy pale visage shrowd , But strike thy silver horn through a cloud , And send a beam upon my swarthy face , By which I may discover all the placeAnd persons , and how many longing eyesAre come to wait on our solemnities. [ Enter Cinthia.How dull and black am I ! I could not findThis beauty without thee , I am so blind ; Methinks they shew like to those Eastern streaksThat warn us hence before the morning breaks ; Back my pale servant , for these eyes know howTo shoot far more and quicker rayes than thou .
Great Queen , they be a Troop for whom aloneOne of my clearest moons I have put on ; A Troop that looks as if thy self and IHad pluckt our rains in , and our whips laid byTo gaze upon these Mortals , that appearBrighter than we .
Then let us keep 'em here , And never more our Chariots drive away , But hold our places , and out-shine the day .
Great Queen of shadows , you arepleas 'd to speakOf more than may be done ; we may not breakThe gods decrees , but when our time is come , Must drive away and give the day our room.Yet whil'st our raign lasts , let us stretch our powerTo give our servants one contented hour , With such unwonted solemn grace and state , As may for ever after force them hateOur brothers glorious beams , and wish the nightCrown 'd with a thousand stars , and our cold light : For almost all the world their service bendTo Phoebus and in vain my light I lend , Gaz 'd on unto my setting from my riseAlmost of none , but of unquiet eyes .
Then shine at full , fair Queen , and by thy powerProduce a birth to crown this happy hour ; Of Nymphs and Shepherds let their songs discover , Easie and sweet , who is a happy Lover ; Or if thou woot , then call thine own EndymionFrom the sweet flowry bed he lies upon , On Latmus top , thy pale beams drawn away , And of this long night let him make a day .
Thou dream'st dark Queen , that fair boy was not mine , Nor went I down to kiss him ; ease and wineHave bred these bold tales ; Poets when they rage , Turn gods to men , and make an hour an age ; But I will give a greater state and glory , And raise to time a noble memoryOf what these Lovers are ; rise , rise , I say , Thou power of deeps , thy surges laid away,
great King of waters , and by meBe proud to be commanded. [ Neptune rises .
Cinthia , see , Thy word hath fetcht me hither , let me know why Iascend .
Doth this majestick showGive thee no knowledge yet ?
Yes , now I see.Something intended ( Cinthia ) worthy thee ; Go on , I'le be a helper .
Hie thee then , And charge the wind flie from his Rockie Den.Let loose thy subjects , only BoreasToo foul for our intention as he was ; Still keep him fast chain 'd ; we must have none hereBut vernal blasts , and gentle winds appear , Such as blow flowers , and through the glad Boughs singMany soft welcomes to the lusty spring.These are our musick : next , thy watry raceBring on in couples ; we are pleas 'd to graceThis noble night , each in their richest thingsYour own deeps or the broken vessel brings ; Be prodigal , and I shall be as kind , And shine at full upon you .
Ho the windCommanding Eolus ! [ Enter Eolus out of a Rock .
Great Neptune !
He .
What is thy will ?
We do command thee free
and thy milder winds to waitUpon our Cinthia , but tye Boreas straight ; He 's too rebellious .
I shall do it .
Do , great master of the flood , and all below , Thy full command has taken .
Ho ! the main ;
Here .
Boreas has broke his chain , And struggling with the rest , has got away .
Let him alone , I'le take him up at sea ; He will not long be thence ; go once againAnd call out of the bottoms of the Main , Blew Proteus , and the rest ; charge them put onTheir greatest pearls , and the most sparkling stoneThe bearing Rock breeds , till this night is doneBy me a solemn honour to the Moon ; Flie like a full sail .
I am gone .
Great Queen of us and Heaven , Hear what I bring to make this hour a full one , If not her measure .
Speak Seas King .
Thy tunes my Amphitrite joyes to have , When they will dance upon the rising wave , And court me as the sails , my Trytons playMusick to lead a storm , I'le lead the way.Song. Measure.To bed , to bed ; come Hymen , lead the Bride , And lay her by her Husbands side : Bring in the Virgins every oneThat grieve to lie alone : That they may kiss while they may say , a maid , To morrow 'twill be other , kist and said:
be long a shining , Whilst these Lovers are a twining .
Ho ! Neptune !
Eolus !
The Seas go hie,
hath rais 'd a storm ; go and applieThy trident , else I prophesie , ere dayMany a tall ship will be cast away : Descend with all the Gods , and all their power tostrike a cal [ m ] .
A thanks to every one , and to gratulateSo great a service done at my desire , Ye shall have many floods fuller and higherThan you have wisht for ; no Ebb shall dareTo let the day see where your dwellings are : Now back unto your Government in haste , Lest your proud charge should swell above the waste , And win upon the Island .
We obey. [ Neptune descends , and the Sea-gods .
Hold up thy head dead night ; seest thou not day ? The East begins to lighten , I must downAnd give my brother place .
Oh ! I could frownTo see the day , the day that flings his lightUpon my Kingdoms , and contemns old Night ; Let him go on and flame , I hope to seeAnother wild-fire in his Axletree ; And all false drencht ; but I forgot , speak Queen.The day grows on I must no more be seen .
Heave up thy drowsie head agen , and seeA greater light , a greater Majestie , Between our sect and us ; whip up thy team ; The day breaks here , and you some flashing streamShot from the South ; say , which way wilt thou go ?
I'le vanish into mists. [ Exeunt .
I into day. [ Finis Mask .
Take lights there Ladies , get the Bride to bed ; We will not see you laid , good night Amintor , We'l ease you of that tedious ceremony ; Were it [ my ] case , I should think time run slow.If thou beest noble , youth , get me a boy , That may defend my Kingdom from my foes .
All happiness to you .
Good night Melantius. [ Exeunt .
Evadne , Aspatia , Dula , and other Ladies .
Madam , shall we undress you for this fight ? The Wars are nak 'd that you must make to night .
You are very merry Dula .
I should be far merrier Madam , if it were with meas it is with you .
Why how now wench ?
Come Ladies will you help ?
I am soon undone .
And as soon done : Good store of Cloaths will trouble you at both .
Art thou drunk Dula ?
Why here 's none but we .
Thou think'st belike , there is no modestyWhen we are alone .
I by my troth you hit my thoughts aright .
You prick me Lady .
'T is against my will , Anon you must endure more , and lie still.You 're best to practise .
Sure this wench is mad .
No faith , this is a trick that I have hadSince I was fourteen .
'T is high time to leave it .
Nay , now I'le keep it till the trick leave me ; A dozen wanton words put in your head , Will make you lively in your Husbands bed .
Nay faith , then take it .
Take it Madam , where ? We all I hope will take it that are here .
Nay then I'le give you o 're .
So will I makeThe ablest man in Rhodes , or his heart to ake .
Wilt take my place to night ?
I'le hold your Cards against any two I know .
What wilt thou do ?
Madam , we'l do't , and make 'm leave play too .
Aspatia , take her part .
I will refuse it.She will pluck down a side , she does not use it .
Why , do .
You will find the playQuickly , because your head lies well that way .
I thank thee Dula , would thou could'st instillSome of thy mirth into Aspatia : Nothing but sad thoughts in her breast do dwell , Methinks a mean betwixt you would do well .
She is in love , hang me if I were so , But I could run my Country , I love tooTo do those things that people in love do .
It were a timeless smile should prove my cheek , It were a fitter hour for me to laugh , When at the Altar the Religious PriestWere pacifying the offended powersWith sacrifice , than now , this should have beenMy night , and all your hands have been imployedIn giving me a spotless offeringTo young Amintors bed , as we are nowFor you : pardon Evadne , would my worthWere great as yours , or that the King , or he , Or both thought so , perhaps he found me worthless , But till he did so , in these ears of mine , ( These credulous ears ) he pour 'd the sweetest wordsThat Art or Love could frame ; if he were false , Pardon it heaven , and if I did wantVertue , you safely may forgive that too , For I have left none that I had from you .
Nay , leave this sad talk Madam .
Would I could , then should I leave the cause .
See if you have not spoil 'd all Dulas mirth .
Thou think'st thy heart hard , but if thou beestcaught , remember me ; thou shalt perceive a fire shotsuddenly into thee .
That 's not so good , let 'm shoot any thing but fire , Ifear 'm not .
Well wench , thou mayst be taken .
Ladies good night , I'le do the rest my self .
Nay , let your Lord do some .
Lay a Garland on my Hearse of the dismal Yew .
That 's one of your sad songs Madam .
Believe me , 't is a very pretty one .
How is it Madam ? SONG.Asp. Lay a Garland on my Hearse of the dismal yew ; Maidens , Willow branches bear ; say I died true : My Love was false , but I was firm from my hour of birth ; Upon my buried body lay lightly gentle earth .
Fie o n't Madam , the words are so strange , theyare able to make one Dream of Hobgoblins ; I could neverhave the power , Sing that Dula.Dula. I could never have the powerTo love one above an hour , But my heart would prompt mine eyeOn some other man to flie ; Venus , fix mine eyes fast , Or if not , give me all that I shall see at last .
So , leave me now .
Nay , we must see you laid .
Madam good night , may all the marriage joysThat longing Maids imagine in their beds , Prove so unto you ; may no discontentGrow 'twixt your Love and you ; but if there do , Enquire of me , and I will guide your moan , Teach you an artificial way to grieve , To keep your sorrow waking ; love your LordNo worse than I ; but if you love so well , Alas , you may displease him , so did I.This is the last time you shall look on me : Ladies farewel ; as soon as I am dead , Come all and watch one night about my Hearse ; Bring each a mournful story and a tearTo offer at it when I go to earth : With flattering Ivie clasp my Coffin round , Write on my brow my fortune , let my BierBe born by Virgins that shall sing by courseThe truth of maids and perjuries of men .
Alas , I pity thee. [ Exit Evadne .
Madam , goodnight .
Come , we'l let in the Bridegroom .
Where 's my Lord ?
Here take this light. [ Enter Amintor .
You'l find her in the dark .
Your Lady 's scarce a bed yet , you must help her .
Go and be happy in your Ladies love ; May all the wrongs that you have done to me , Be utterly forgotten in my death.I'le trouble you no more , yet I will takeA parting kiss , and will not be denied.You'l come my Lord , and see the Virgins weepWhen I am laid in earth , though you your selfCan know no pity : thus I wind my selfInto this willow Garland , and am prouderThat I was once your Love ( though now refus 'd ) Than to have had another true to me.So with my prayers I leave you , and must trySome yet unpractis 'd way to grieve and die .
Come Ladies , will you go ?
Goodnight my Lord .
Much happiness unto you all .
I did that Lady wrong ; methinks I feelHer grief shoot suddenly through all my veins ; Mine eyes run ; this is strange at such a time.It was the King first mov 'd me to't , but heHas not my will in keeping -- why do IPerplex my self thus ? something whispers me , Go not to bed ; my guilt is not so greatAs mine own conscience ( too sensible ) Would make me think ; I only brake a promise , And 't was the King that forc't me : timorous flesh , Why shak'st thou so ? away my idle fears. [ Enter Evadne.Yonder she is , the lustre of whose eyeCan blot away the sad remembranceOf all these things : Oh my Evadne , spareThat tender body , let it not take cold , The vapours of the night will not fall here.To bed my Love ; Hymen will punish usFor being slack performers of his rites.Cam'st thou to call me ?
No .
Come , come my Love , And let us lose our selves to one another.Why art thou up so long ?
I am not well .
To bed then let me wind thee in these arms , Till I have banisht sickness .
Good my Lord , I can not sleep .
Evadne , we'l watch , I mean no sleeping .
I'le not go to bed .
I prethee do .
I will not for the world .
Why my dear Love ?
Why ? I have sworn I will not .
Sworn !
I .
How ? Sworn Evadne ?
Yes , Sworn Amintor , and will swear againIf you will wish to hear me.0
To whom have you Sworn this ?
If I should name him , the matter were not great .
Come , this is but the coyness of a Bride .
The coyness of a Bride ?
How prettily that frown becomes thee !
Do you like it so ?
Thou canst not dress thy face in such a lookBut I shall like it .
What look likes you best ?
Why do you ask ?
That I may shew you one less pleasing to you .
How 's that ?
That I may shew you one less pleasing to you .
I prethee put thy jests in milder looks.It shews as thou wert angry .
So perhaps I am indeed .
Why , who has done thee wrong ? Name me the man , and by thy self I swear , Thy yet unconquer 'd self , I will revenge thee .
Now I shall try thy truth ; if thou dost love me , Thou weigh'st not any thing compar 'd with me ; Life , Honour , joyes Eternal , all DelightsThis world can yield , or hopeful people feign , Or in the life to come , are light as AirTo a true Lover when his Lady frowns , And bids him do this : wilt thou kill this man ? Swear my Amintor , and I'le kiss the sin off fromthy lips .
I will not swear sweet Love , Till I do know the cause .
I would thou wouldst ; Why , it is thou that wrongest me , I hate thee , Thou shouldst have kill 'd thy self .
If I should know that , I should quickly killThe man you hated .
Know it then , and do't .
Oh no , what look soe 're thou shalt put on , To try my faith , I shall not think thee false ; I can not find one blemish in thy face , Where falsehood should abide : leave and to bed ; If you have sworn to any of the VirginsThat were your old companions , to preserveYour Maidenhead a night , it may be done without thismeans .
A Maidenhead Amintor at my years ?
Sure she raves , this can not beThy natural temper ; shall I call thy maids ? Either thy healthful sleep hath left thee long , Or else some Fever rages in thy blood .
Neither Amintor ; think you I am mad , Because I speak the truth ?
Will you not lie with me to night ?
To night ? you talk as if I would hereafter .
Hereafter ? yes , I do .
You are deceiv 'd , put off amazement , and with patience markWhat I shall utter , for the OracleKnows nothing truer , 't is not for a nightOr two that I forbear thy bed , but for ever .
I dream , -- awake Amintor !
You hear right , I sooner will find out the beds of Snakes , And with my youthful blood warm their cold flesh , Letting them curle themselves about my Limbs , Than sleep one night with thee ; this is not feign 'd , Nor sounds it like the coyness of a Bride .
Is flesh so earthly to endure all this ? Are these the joyes of Marriage ? Hymen keepThis story ( that will make succeeding youthNeglect thy Ceremonies ) from all ears.Let it not rise up for thy shame and mineTo after ages ; we will scorn thy Laws , If thou no better bless them ; touch the heartOf her that thou hast sent me , or the worldShall know there 's not an Altar that will smoakIn praise of thee ; we will adopt us Sons ; Then vertue shall inherit , and not blood : If we do lust , we'l take the next we meet , Serving our selves as other Creatures do , And never take note of the Female more , Nor of her issue. I do rage in vain , She can but jest ; Oh ! pardon me my Love ; So dear the thoughts are that I hold of thee , That I must break forth ; satisfie my fear : It is a pain beyond the hand of death , To be in doubt ; confirm it with an Oath , if this be true .
Do you invent the form : Let there be in it all the binding wordsDevils and Conjurers can put together , And I will take it ; I have sworn before , And here by all things holy do again , Never to be acquainted with thy bed.Is your doubt over now ?
I know too much , would I had doubted still ; Was ever such a marriage night as this ! You powers above , if you did ever meanMan should be us 'd thus , you have thought a wayHow he may bear himself , and save his honour : Instruct me in it ; for to my dull eyesThere is no mean , no moderate course to run , I must live scorn 'd , or be a murderer : Is there a third ? why is this night so calm ? Why does not Heaven speak in Thunder to us , And drown her voice ?
This rage will do no good .
Evadne , hear me , thou hast ta'ne an Oath , But such a rash one , that to keep it , wereWorse than to swear it ; call it back to thee ; Such vows as those never ascend the Heaven ; A tear or two will wash it quite away : Have mercy on my youth , my hopeful youth , If thou be pitiful , for ( without boast ) This Land was proud of me : what Lady was thereThat men call 'd fair and vertuous in this Isle , That would have shun 'd my love ? It is in theeTo make me hold this worth -- Oh ! we vain menThat trust out all our reputation , To rest upon the weak and yielding handOf feeble Women ! but thou art not stone ; Thy flesh is soft , and in thine eyes doth dwellThe spirit of Love , thy heart can not be hard.Come lead me from the bottom of despair , To all the joyes thou hast ; I know thou wilt ; And make me careful , lest the sudden changeO're-come my spirits .
When I call back this Oath , the pains of hell inviron me .
I sleep , and am too temperate ; come to bed , or byThose hairs , which if thou hast a soul like to thy locks , Were threads for Kings to wear about their arms .
Why so perhaps they are .
I'le drag thee to my bed , and make thy tongueUndo this wicked Oath , or on thy fleshI'le print a thousand wounds to let out life .
I fear thee not , do what thou dar'st to me ; Every ill-sounding word , or threatning lookThou shew'st to me , will be reveng 'd at full .
It will not sure Evadne .
Do not you hazard that .
Ha'ye your Champions ?
Alas Amintor , thinkst thou I forbearTo sleep with thee , because I have put onA maidens strictness ? look upon these cheeks , And thou shalt find the hot and rising bloodUnapt for such a vow ; no , in this heartThere dwels as much desire , and as much willTo put that wisht act in practice , as ever yetWas known to woman , and they have been shownBoth ; but it was the folly of thy youth , To think this beauty ( to what Land soe'reIt shall be call 'd ) shall stoop to any second.I do enjoy the best , and in that heightHave sworn to stand or die : you guess the man .
No , let me know the man that wrongs me so , That I may cut his body into motes , And scatter it before the Northern wind .
You dare not strike him .
Do not wrong me so ; Yes , if his body were a poysonous plant , That it were death to touch , I have a soulWill throw me on him .
Why 't is the King .
The King !
What will you do now ?
'T is not the King .
What , did he make this match for dull Amintor ?
Oh ! thou hast nam 'd a word that wipes awayAll thoughts revengeful : in that sacred name , The King , there lies a terror : what frail manDares lift his hand against it ? let the GodsSpeak to him when they please ; Till then let us suffer and wait .
Why should you fill your self so full of heat , And haste so to my bed ? I am no Virgin .
What Devil put it in thy fancy thenTo marry me ?
Alas , I must have oneTo Father Children , and to bear the nameOf Husband to me , that my sin may be more honourable .
What a strange thing am I !
A miserable one ; one that my self am sorry for .
Why shew it then in this , If thou hast pity , though thy love be none , Kill me , and all true Lovers that shall liveIn after ages crost in their desires , Shall bless thy memory , and call thee good , Because such mercy in thy heart was found , To rid a lingring Wretch .
I must have oneTo fill thy room again , if thou wert dead , Else by this night I would : I pity thee .
These strange and sudden injuries have falnSo thick upon me , that I lose all senseOf what they are : methinks I am not wrong 'd , Nor is it ought , if from the censuring WorldI can but hide it -- Reputation , Thou art a word , no more ; but thou hast shownAn impudence so high , that to the WorldI fear thou wilt betray or shame thy self .
To cover shame I took thee , never fearThat I would blaze my self .
Nor let the KingKnow I conceive he wrongs me , then mine honourWill thrust me into action , that my fleshCould bear with patience ; and it is some easeTo me in these extreams , that I knew thisBefore I toucht thee ; else had all the sinsOf mankind stood betwixt me and the King , I had gone through 'em to his heart and thine.I have lost one desire , 't is not his crownShall buy me to thy bed : now I resolveHe has dishonour 'd thee ; give me thy hand , Be careful of thy credit , and sin close , 'T is all I wish ; upon thy Chamber-flooreI'le rest to night , that morning visitersMay think we did as married people use.And prethee smile upon me when they come , And seem to toy , as if thou hadst been pleas'dWith what we did .
Fear not , I will do this .
Come let us practise , and as wantonlyAs ever loving Bride and Bridegroom met , Lets laugh and enter here .
I am content .
Down all the swellings of my troubled heart.When we walk thus intwin 'd , let all eyes seeIf ever Lovers better did agree. [ Exit .
Aspatia , Antiphila and Olympias .
Away , you are not sad , force it no further ; Good Gods , how well you look ! such a full colourYoung bashful Brides put on : sure you are new married .
Yes Madam , to your grief .
Alas ! poor Wenches.Go learn to love first , learn to lose your selves , Learn to be flattered , and believe , and blessThe double tongue that did it ; Make a Faith out of the miracles of Ancient Lovers.Did you ne 're love yet Wenches ? speak Olympias , Such as speak truth and dy 'd i n't , And like me believe all faithful , and be miserable ; Thou hast an easie temper , fit for stamp .
Never .
Nor you Antiphila ?
Nor I .
Of Ariadne , Madam ?
Yes that piece.This should be Theseus , h'as a cousening face , You meant him for a man .
He was so Madam .
Why then 't is well enough , never look back , You have a full wind , and a false heart Theseus ; Does not the story say , his Keel was split , Or his Masts spent , or some kind rock or otherMet with his Vessel ?
Not as I remember .
It should ha ' been so ; could the Gods know this , And not of all their number raise a storm ? But they are all as ill. This false smile was wellexprest ; Just such another caught me ; you shall not goso Antiphila , In this place work a quick-sand , And over it a shallow smiling Water.And his ship ploughing it , and then a fear.Do that fear to the life Wench .
'Twill wrong the story .
'Twill make the story wrong 'd by wanton PoetsLive long and be believ 'd ; but where 's the Lady ?
There Madam .
Fie , you have mist it here Antiphila , You are much mistaken Wench ; These colours are not dull and pale enough , To shew a soul so full of miseryAs this sad Ladies was ; do it by me , Do it again by me the lost Aspatia , And you shall find all true but the wild Island ; I stand upon the Sea breach now , and thinkMine arms thus , and mine hair blown with the wind , Wild as that desart , and let all about meTell that I am forsaken , do my face ( If thou hadst ever feeling of a sorrow ) Thus , thus , Antiphila strive to make me lookLike sorrows monument ; and the trees about me , Let them be dry and leaveless ; let the RocksGroan with continual surges , and behind meMake all a desolation ; look , look Wenches , A miserable life of this poor Picture .
Dear Madam !
I have done , sit down , and let usUpon that point fix all our eyes , that point there ; Make a dull silence till you feel a sudden sadnessGive us new souls. [ Enter Calianax .
The King may do this , and he may not do it ; My child is wrong 'd , disgrac 'd : well , how now Huswives ? What at your ease ? is this a time to sit still ? up youyoungLazie Whores , up or I'le sweng you .
Nay , good my Lord .
You'l lie down shortly , get you in and work ; What are you grown so resty ? you want ears , We shall have some of the Court boys do that Office .
My Lord we do no more than we are charg 'd : It is the Ladies pleasure we be thus in grief ; She is forsaken .
There 's a Rogue too , A young dissembling slave ; well , get you in , I'le have a bout with that boy ; 't is high timeNow to be valiant ; I confess my youthWas never prone that way : what , made an Ass ? A Court stale ? well I will be valiant , And beat some dozen of these Whelps ; I will ; and there'sAnother of 'em , a trim cheating souldier , I'le maul that Rascal , h'as out-brav 'd me twice ; But now I thank the Gods I am valiant ; Go , get you in , I'le take a course with all. [ Exeunt Omnes .
Cleon , Strato , Diphilus .
Your sister is not up yet .
Oh , Brides must take their mornings rest , The night is troublesome .
But not tedious .
What odds , he has not my Sisters maiden-head tonight ?
No , it 's odds against any Bridegroom living , hene 're gets it while he lives .
Y'are merry with my Sister , you'l please to allowme the same freedom with your Mother .
She 's at your service .
Then she 's merry enough of her self , she needsno tickling ; knock at the door .
We shall interrupt them .
No matter , they have the year before them.Good morrow Sister ; spare your self to day , the nightwill come again. [ Enter Amintor .
Who 's there , my Brother ? I am no readier yet , your Sister is but now up .
You look as you had lost your eyes to night ; Ithink you ha ' not slept .
I faith I have not .
You have done better then .
We ventured for a Boy ; when he is Twelve , He shall command against the foes of Rhodes .
You can not , you want sleep. [ Aside .
'T is true ; but sheAs if she had drunk Lethe , or had madeEven with Heaven , did fetch so still a sleep , So sweet and sound .
What 's that ?
Your Sister frets this morning , and does turn hereyes upon me , as people on their headsman ; she doeschafe , and kiss , and chafe again , and clap my cheeks ; she 's in another world .
Then I had lost ; I was about to lay , you had notgot her Maiden-head to night .
Ha ! he does not mock me ; y'ad lost indeed ; I do not use to bungle .
You do deserve her .
I laid my lips to hers , and [ t ] hat wild breathThat was rude and rough to me , last night [ Aside.Was sweet as April ; I'le be guilty too , If these be the effects. [ Enter Melantius .
Good day Amintor , for to me the nameOf Brother is too distant ; we are friends , And that is nearer .
Dear Melantius ! Let me behold thee ; is it possible ?
What sudden gaze is this ?
'T is wonderous strange .
Why does thine eye desire so strict a viewOf that it knows so well ? There 's nothing here that is not thine .
I wonder much Melantius , To see those noble looks that make me thinkHow vertuous thou art ; and on the sudden'Tis strange to me , thou shouldst have worth and honour , Or not be base , and false , and treacherous , And every ill. But --
Stay , stay my Friend , I fear this sound will not become our loves ; no more , embrace me .
Oh mistake me not ; I know thee to be full of all those deedsThat we frail men call good : but by the courseOf nature thou shouldst be as quickly chang'dAs are the winds , dissembling as the Sea , That now wears brows as smooth as Virgins be , Tempting the Merchant to invade his face , And in an hour calls his billows up , And shoots 'em at the Sun , destroying allHe carries on him. O how near am I [ Aside.To utter my sick thoughts !
But why , my Friend , should I be so by Nature ?
I have wed thy Sister , who hath vertuous thoughtsEnough for one whole family , and it is strangeThat you should feel no want .
Believe me , this complement 's too cunning for me .
What should I be then by the course of nature , They having both robb 'd me of so much vertue ?
O call the Bride , my Lord Amintor , that we maysee her blush , and turn her eyes down ; it is theprettiest sport .
Evadne !
My Lord ! [ Within .
Come forth my Love , Your Brothers do attend to wish you joy .
I am not ready yet .
Enough , enough .
They'l mock me .
Faith thou shalt come in. [ Enter Evadne .
Good morrow Sister ; he that understandsWhom you have wed , need not to wish you joy.You have enough , take heed you be not proud .
O Sister , what have you done !
I done ! why , what have I done ?
My Lord Amintor swears you are no Maid now .
Push !
I faith he does .
I knew I should be mockt .
With a truth .
If 'twere to do again , in faith I would not marry .
Not I by Heaven. [ Aside .
Sister , Dula swears she heard you cry two rooms off .
Fie how you talk !
Let 's see you walk .
By my troth y'are spoil 'd .
Amintor !
Ha !
Thou art sad .
Who I ? I thank you for that , shall Diphilus , thou and I sing a catch ?
How !
Prethee let 's .
Nay , that 's too much the other way .
I am so lightned with my happiness : how dostthou Love ? kiss me .
I can not love you , you tell tales of me .
Nothing but what becomes us : Gentlemen , Would you had all such Wives , and all the world , That I might be no wonder ; y'are all sad ; What , do you envie me ? I walk methinksOn water , and ne 're sink , I am so light .
'T is well you are so .
Well ? how can I be other , when she looks thus ? Is there no musick there ? let 's dance .
Why ? this is strange , Amintor !
I do not know my self ; Yet I could wish my joy were less .
I'le marry too , if it will make one thus .
Amintor , hark. [ Aside .
What says my Love ? I must obey .
You do it scurvily , 'twill be perceiv 'd .
My Lord the King is here. [ Enter King and Lysi .
Where ?
And his Brother .
Good morrow all .
joy on , joy fall thick upon thee ! And Madam , you are alter 'd since I saw you , I must salute you ; you are now anothers ; How lik't you your nights rest ?
Ill Sir .
I ! 'deed she took but little .
You'l let her take more , and thank her too shortly .
Amintor , wert thou truly honestTill thou wert Married ?
Yes Sir .
Tell me then , how shews the sport unto thee ?
Why well .
What did you do ?
No more nor less than other couples use ; You know what 't is ; it has but a course name .
But prethee , I should think by her black eye , And her red cheek , she should be quick and stirringIn this same business , ha ?
I can not tell , I ne 're try 'd other Sir , but I perceiveShe is as quick as you delivered .
Well , you'l trust me then Amintor , To choose a Wife for you agen ?
No never Sir .
Why ? like you this so ill ?
So well I like her.For this I bow my knee in thanks to you , And unto Heaven will pay my grateful tributeHourly , and to hope we shall draw outA long contented life together here , And die both full of gray hairs in one day ; For which the thanks is yours ; but if the powersThat rule us , please to call her first away , Without pride spoke , this World holds not a WifeWorthy to take her room .
I do not like this ; all forbear the roomBut you Amintor and your Lady. I have some speech withYou , that may concern your after living well .
He will not tell me that he lies with her : ifhe do , Something Heavenly stay my heart , for I shall be aptTo thrust this arm of mine to acts unlawful .
You will suffer me to talk with her Amintor , And not have a jealous pang !
Sir , I dare trust my WifeWith whom she dares to talk , and not be jealous .
How do you like Amintor ?
As I did Sir .
How 's that !
As one that to fulfil your will and pleasure , I have given leave to call me Wife and Love .
I see there is no lasting Faith in Sin ; They that break word with Heaven , will break againWith all the World , and so dost thou with me .
How Sir ?
This subtile Womans ignoranceWill not excuse you ; thou hast taken OathsSo great , methought they did not well becomeA Womans mouth , that thou wouldst ne 're enjoyA man but me .
I never did swear so ; you do me wrong .
Day and night have heard it .
I swore indeed that I would never loveA man of lower place ; but if your fortuneShould throw you from this height , I bade you trustI would forsake you , and would bend to himThat won your Throne ; I love with my ambition , Not with mine eyes ; but if I ever yetToucht any other , Leprosie light hereUpon my face , which for your Royalty I would not stain .
Why thou dissemblest , and it is in me to punish thee .
Why , it is in me then not to love you , which willMore afflict your body , than your punishment can mine .
But thou hast let Amintor lie with thee .
I ha'not .
Impudence ! he saies himself so .
He lyes .
He does not .
By this light he does , strangely and basely , andI'le prove it so ; I did not shun him for a night , But told him I would never close with him .
Speak lower , 't is false .
I 'm no man to answer with a blow ; Or if I were , you are the King ; but urge me not , 'tismost true .
Do not I know the uncontrouled thoughtsThat youth brings with him , when his bloud is highWith expectation and desires of thatHe long hath waited for ? is not his spirit , Though he be temperate , of a valiant strain , As this our age hath known ? what could he do , If such a sudden speech had met his blood , But ruine thee for ever ? if he had not kill 'd thee , He could not bear it thus ; he is as we , Or any other wrong 'd man .
It is dissembling .
Take him ; farewel ; henceforth I am thy foe ; And what disgraces I can blot thee , look for .
Stay Sir ; Amintor , you shall hear , Amintor .
What my Love ?
Amintor , thou hast an ingenious look , And shouldst be vertuous ; it amazeth me , That thou canst make such base malicious lyes .
What my dear Wife ?
Dear Wife ! I do despise thee ; Why , nothing can be baser , than to sowDissention amongst Lovers .
Lovers ! who ?
The King and me .
O Heaven !
Who should live long , and love without distaste , Were it not for such pickthanks as thy self ! Did you lie with me ? swear now , and be punisht in hellFor this .
The faithless Sin I madeTo fair Aspatia , is not yet reveng 'd , It follows me ; I will not lose a wordTo this wild Woman ; but to you my King , The anguish of my soul thrusts out this truth , Y'are a Tyrant ; and not so much to wrongAn honest man thus , as to take a prideIn talking with him of it .
Now Sir , see how loud this fellow lyed .
You that can know to wrong , should know howMen must right themselves : what punishment is dueFrom me to him that shall abuse my bed ! It is not death ; nor can that satisfie , Unless I send your lives through all the Land , To shew how nobly I have freed my self .
Draw not thy Sword , thou knowest I can not fearA subjects hand ; but thou shalt feel the weight of thisIf thou dost rage .
The weight of that ? If you have any worth , for Heavens sake thinkI fear not Swords ; for as you are meer man , I dare as easily kill you for this deed , As you dare think to do it ; but there isDivinity about you , that strikes deadMy rising passions , as you are my King , I fall before you , and present my SwordTo cut mine own flesh , if it be your will.Alas ! I am nothing but a multitudeOf walking griefs ; yet should I murther you , I might before the world take the excuseOf madness : for compare my injuries , And they will well appear too sad a weightFor reason to endure ; but fall I firstAmongst my sorrows , ere my treacherous handTouch holy things : but why ? I know not whatI have to say ; why did you choose out meTo make thus wretched ? there were thousand foolsEasie to work on , and of state enough within the Island .
I would not have a fool , it were no credit for me .
Worse and worse ! Thou that dar'st talk unto thy Husband thus , Profess thy self a Whore ; and more than so , Resolve to be so still ; it is my fateTo bear and bow beneath a thousand griefs , To keep that little credit with the World.But there were wise ones too , you might have ta'neanother .
No ; for I believe thee honest , as thou wert valiant .
All the happinessBestow 'd upon me , turns into disgrace ; Gods take your honesty again , for IAm loaden with it ; good my Lord the King , be privatein it .
Thou may'st live Amintor , Free as thy King , if thou wilt wink at this , And be a means that we may meet in secret .
A Baud ! hold my breast , a bitter curseSeize me , if I forget not all respectsThat are Religious , on another wordSounded like that , and through a Sea of sinsWill wade to my revenge , though I should callPains here , and after life upon my soul .
Well I am resolute you lay not with her , And so leave you. [ Exit King .
You must be prating , and see what follows .
Prethee vex me not.Leave me , I am afraid some sudden startWill pull a murther on me .
I am gone ; I love my life well. [ Exit Evadne .
I hate mine as much.This 't is to break a troth ; I should be gladIf all this tide of grief would make me mad. [ Exit .
I'le know the cause of all Amintors griefs , Or friendship shall be idle. [ Enter Calianax .
O Melantius , my Daughter will die .
Trust me , I am sorry ; would thou hadst ta'ne her room .
Thou art a slave , a cut-throat slave , a bloody treacherousslave .
Take heed old man , thou wilt be heard to rave , And lose thine Offices .
I am valiant grownAt all these years , and thou art but a slave .
Leave , some company will come , and I respectThy years , not thee so much , that I could wishTo laugh at thee alone .
I'le spoil your mirth , I mean to fight with thee ; There lie my Cloak , this was my Fathers Sword , And he durst fight ; are you prepar 'd ?
Why ? wilt thou doat thy self out of thy life ? Hence get thee to bed , have careful looking to , and eatwarm things , and trouble not me : my head is full ofthoughts more weighty than thy life or death can be .
You have a name in War , when you stand safeAmongst a multitude ; but I will tryWhat you dare do unto a weak old manIn single fight ; you'l ground I fear : Come draw .
I will not draw , unless thou pul'st thy deathUpon thee with a stroke ; there 's no one blowThat thou canst give , hath strength enough to kill me.Tempt me not so far then ; the power of earthShall not redeem thee .
I must let him alone , He 's stout and able ; and to say the truth , However I may set a face , and talk , I am not valiant : when I was a youth , I kept my credit with a testie trick I had , Amongst cowards , but durst never fight .
I will not promise to preserve your life if you do stay .
I would give half my Land that I durst fight withthat proud man a little : if I had men to hold , I wouldbeat him , till he ask me mercy .
Sir , will you be gone ?
I dare not stay , but I will go home , and beat myservants all over for this. [ Exit Calianax .
This old fellow haunts me , But the distracted carriage of mine AmintorTakes deeply on me , I will find the cause ; I fear his Conscience cries , he wrong 'd Aspatia .
Mens eyes are not so subtil to perceiveMy inward misery ; I bear my griefHid from the World ; how art thou wretched then ? For ought I know , all Husbands are like me ; And every one I talk with of his Wife , Is but a well dissembler of his woesAs I am ; would I knew it , for the rareness afflicts menow .
Amintor , We have not enjoy 'd our friendship of late , for we were wont to charge our souls in talk .
Melantius , I can tell thee a good jest of Strato anda Lady the last day .
How wast ?
Why such an odd one .
I have long 'd to speak with you , not of an idle jestthat 's forc 'd , but of matter you are bound to utterto me .
What is that my friend ?
I have observ 'd , your words fall from your tongueWildly ; and all your carriage , Like one that strove to shew his merry mood , When he were ill dispos 'd : you were not wontTo put such scorn into your speech , or wearUpon your face ridiculous jollity : Some sadness sits here , which your cunning wouldCover o 're with smiles , and 'twill not be. What is it ?
A sadness here ! what causeCan fate provide for me , to make me so ? Am I not lov 'd through all this Isle ? the KingRains greatness on me : have I not receivedA Lady to my bed , that in her eyeKeeps mounting fire , and on her tender cheeksInevitable colour , in her heartA prison for all vertue ? are not you , Which is above all joyes , my constant friend ? What sadness can I have ? no , I am light , And feel the courses of my blood more warmAnd stirring than they were ; faith marry too , And you will feel so unexprest a joyIn chast embraces , that you will indeed appear another .
You may shape , Amintor , Causes to cozen the whole world withal , And your self too ; but 't is not like a friend , To hide your soul from me ; 't is not your natureTo be thus idle ; I have seen you standAs you were blasted ; midst of all your mirth , Call thrice aloud , and then start , feigning joySo coldly : World ! what do I here ? a friendIs nothing , Heaven ! I would ha ' told that manMy secret sins ; I'le search an unknown Land , And there plant friendship , all is withered here ; Come with a complement , I would have fought , Or told my friend he ly 'd , ere sooth 'd him so ; Out of my bosom .
But there is nothing .
Worse and worse ; farewel ; From this time have acquaintance , but no friend .
Melantius , stay , you shall know what that is .
See how you play 'd with friendship ; be advis'dHow you give cause unto your self to say , You ha'losta friend .
Forgive what I have done ; For I am so ore-gone with injuriesUnheard of , that I lose considerationOf what I ought to do -- oh -- oh .
Do not weep ; what is't ? May I once but know the manHath turn 'd my friend thus ?
I had spoke at first , but that .
But what ?
I held it most unfitFor you to know ; faith do not know it yet .
Thou seest my love , that will keep companyWith thee in tears ; hide nothing then from me ; For when I know the cause of thy distemper , With mine own armour I'le adorn my self , My resolution , and cut through thy foes , Unto thy quiet , till I place thy heartAs peaceable as spotless innocence. What is it ?
Why , 't is this -- it is too bigTo get out , let my tears make way a while .
Punish me strangely heaven , if he escapeOf life or fame , that brought this youth to this .
Your Sister .
Well said .
You'l wish't unknown , when you have heard it .
No .
Is much to blame , And to the King has given her honour up , And lives in Whoredom with him .
How , this ! Thou art run mad with injury indeed , Thou couldst not utter this else ; speak again , For I forgive it freely ; tell thy griefs .
She 's wanton ; I am loth to say a Whore , Though it be true .
Speak yet again , before mine anger growUp beyond throwing down ; what are thy griefs ?
By all our friendship , these .
What ? am I tame ? After mine actions , shall the name of friendBlot all our family , and strike the brandOf Whore upon my Sister unreveng 'd ? My shaking flesh be thou a Witness for me , With what unwillingness I go to scourgeThis Rayler , whom my folly hath call 'd Friend ; I will not take thee basely ; thy swordHangs near thy hand , draw it , that I may whipThy rashness to repentance ; draw thy sword .
Not on thee , did thine anger swell as highAs the wild surges ; thou shouldst do me easeHere , and Eternally , if thy noble handWould cut me from my sorrows .
This is base and fearful ! they that use to utter lyes , Provide not blows , but words to qualifieThe men they wrong 'd ; thou hast a guilty cause .
Thou pleasest me ; for so much more like this , Will raise my anger up above my griefs , Which is a passion easier to be born , And I shall then be happy .
Take then more to raise thine anger. 'T is meerCowardize makes thee not draw ; and I will leave theedeadHowever ; but if thou art so much prestWith guilt and fear , as not to dare to fight , I'le make thy memory loath 'd , and fix a scandalUpon thy name for ever .
Then I draw , As justly as our Magistrates their Swords , To cut offenders off ; I knew before'Twould grate your ears ; but it was base in youTo urge a weighty secret from your friend , And then rage at it ; I shall be at easeIf I be kill 'd ; and if you fall by me , I shall not long out-live you .
Stay a while.The name of friend is more than family , Or all the world besides ; I was a fool.Thou searching humane nature , that didst wakeTo do me wrong , thou art inquisitive , And thrusts me upon questions that will takeMy sleep away ; would I had died ere knownThis sad dishonour ; pardon me my friend ; If thou wilt strike , here is a faithful heart , Pierce it , for I will never heave my handTo thine ; behold the power thou hast in me ! I do believe my Sister is a Whore , A Leprous one , put up thy sword young man .
How should I bear it then , she being so ? I fear my friend that you will lose me shortly ; And I shall do a foul action my selfThrough these disgraces .
Better half the LandWere buried quick together ; no , Amintor , Thou shalt have ease : O this Adulterous KingThat drew her to't ! where got he the spiritTo wrong me so ?
What is it then to me , If it be wrong to you !
Why , not so much : the credit of our houseIs thrown away ; But from his Iron Den I'le waken death , And hurle him on this King ; my honestyShall steel my sword , and on its horrid pointI'le wear my cause , that shall amaze the eyesOf this proud man , and be too glitteringFor him to look on .
I have quite undone my fame .
Dry up thy watry eyes , And cast a manly look upon my face ; For nothing is so wild as I thy friendTill I have freed thee ; still this swelling breast ; I go thus from thee , and will never ceaseMy vengeance , till I find my heart at peace .
It must not be so ; stay , mine eyes would tellHow loth I am to this ; but love and tearsLeave me a while , for I have hazardedAll this world calls happy ; thou hast wroughtA secret from me under name of Friend , Which Art could ne 're have found , nor torture wrungFrom out my bosom ; give it me agen , For I will find it , wheresoe 're it liesHid in the mortal'st part ; invent a way to give it back .
Why , would you have it back ? I will to death pursue him with revenge .
Therefore I call it back from thee ; for I knowThy blood so high , that thou wilt stir in this , andshame meTo posterity : take to thy Weapon .
Hear thy friend , that bears more years than thou .
I will not hear : but draw , or I -- --
Amintor .
Draw then , for I am full as resoluteAs fame and honour can inforce me be ; I can not linger , draw .
I do -- but is notMy share of credit equal with thine if I do stir ?
No ; for it will be cal'dHonour in thee to spill thy Sisters blood , If she her birth abuse , and on the KingA brave revenge : but on me that have walktWith patience in it , it will fix the nameOf fearful Cuckold -- O that word ! be quick .
Then joyn with me .
I dare not do a sin , or else I would : be speedy .
Then dare not fight with me , for that 's a sin.His grief distracts him ; call thy thoughts agen , And to thy self pronounce the name of friend , And see what that will work ; I will not fight .
You must .
I will be kill 'd first , though my passionsOffred the like to you ; 't is not this earthShall buy my reason to it ; think a while , For you are ( I must weep when I speak that ) Almost besides your self .
Oh my soft temper ! So many sweet words from thy Sisters mouth , I am afraid would make me take herTo embrace , and pardon her. I am mad indeed , And know not what I do ; yet have a careOf me in what thou doest .
Why thinks my friend I will forget his honour , or to saveThe bravery of our house , will lose his fame , And fear to touch the Throne of Majesty ?
A curse will follow that , but rather liveAnd suffer with me .
I will do what worth shall bid me , and no more .
Faith I am sick , and desperately I hope , Yet leaning thus , I feel a kind of ease .
Come take agen your mirth about you .
I shall never do't .
I warrant you , look up , wee'l walk together , Put thine arm here , all shall be well agen .
Thy Love , O wretched , I thy Love , Melantius ; why , I have nothing else .
Be merry then. [ Exeunt. Enter Melantius agen .
This worthy young man may do violenceUpon himself , but I have cherisht himTo my best power , and sent him smiling from meTo counterfeit again ; Sword hold thine edge , My heart will never fail me : Diphilus , Thou com'st as sent. [ Enter Diphilus .
Yonder has been such laughing .
Betwixt whom ?
Why , our Sister and the King , I thought their spleens would break , They laught us all out of the room .
They must weep , Diphilus .
Must they ?
They must : thou art my Brother , and if I did believeThou hadst a base thought , I would rip it out , Lie where it durst .
You should not , I would first mangle my self and find it .
That was spoke according to our strain ; comeJoyn thy hands to mine , And swear a firmness to what project I shall laybefore thee .
You do wrong us both ; People hereafter shall not say there pastA bond more than our loves , to tie our livesAnd deaths together .
It is as nobly said as I would wish ; Anon I'le tell you wonders ; we are wrong 'd .
But I will tell you now , wee'l right our selves .
Stay not , prepare the armour in my house ; And what friends you can draw unto our side , Not knowing of the cause , make ready too ; Haste Diphilus , the time requires it , haste. [ Exit Diphilus.I hope my cause is just , I know my bloodTells me it is , and I will credit it : To take revenge , and lose my self withal , Were idle ; and to scape impossible , Without I had the fort , which miseryRemaining in the hands of my old enemy
, but I must have it , see [ Enter Calianax.Where he comes shaking by me : good my Lord , Forget your spleen to me , I never wrong 'd you , But would have peace with every man .
'T is well ; If I durst fight , your tongue would lie at quiet .
Y'are touchie without all cause .
Do , mock me .
By mine honour I speak truth .
Honour ? where is't ?
See what starts you make into your hatred to mylove and freedom to you. -- I come with resolution to obtain a suit of you .
A suit of me ! 't is very like it should be granted , Sir .
Nay , go not hence ; 'T is this ; you have the keeping of the Fort , And I would wish you by the love you oughtTo bear unto me , to deliver it into my hands .
I am in hope that thou art mad , to talk to me thus .
But there is a reason to move you to it. I wouldkill the King that wrong 'd you and your daughter .
Out Traytor !
Nay but stay ; I can not scape , the deed once done , Without I have this fort .
And should I help thee ? now thy treacherous mindbetrays it self .
Come , delay me not ; Give me a sudden answer , or alreadyThy last is spoke ; refuse not offered love , When it comes clad in secrets .
If I say I will not , he will kill me , I do see't writIn his looks ; and should I say I will , he'l runand tell the
dear Melantius , But this cause is weighty , give me but an hourto think .
Take it -- I know this goes unto the King , But I am arm'd. [ Ex. Melant .
Me thinks I feel my selfBut twenty now agen ; this fighting foolWants Policy ; I shall revenge my Girl , And make her red again ; I pray , my legsWill last that pace that I will carry them , I shall want breath before I find the King .
Melantius , Evadne , and a Lady .
Save you .
Save you sweet Brother .
In my blunt eye methinks you look Evadne .
Come , you would make me blush .
I would Evadne , I shall displease my ends else .
You shall if you command me ; I am bashful ; Come Sir , how do I look ?
I would not have your women hear meBreak into commendation of you , 't is not seemly .
Go wait me in the Gallery -- now speak .
I'le lock the door first. [ Exeunt Ladies .
Why ?
I will not have your guilded things that dance invisitation with their Millan skins choke up my business .
You are strangely dispos 'd Sir .
Good Madam , not to make you merry .
No , if you praise me , 'twill make me sad .
Such a sad commendation I have for you .
Brother , the Court hath made you witty , And learn to riddle .
I praise the Court for't ; has it learned you nothing ?
Me ?
I Evadne , thou art young and handsom , A Lady of a sweet complexion , And such a flowing carriage , that it cannotChuse but inflame a Kingdom .
Gentle Brother !
'T is yet in thy remembrance , foolish woman , To make me gentle .
How is this ?
'T is base , And I could blush at these years , through allMy honour 'd scars , to come to such a parly .
I understand you not .
You dare not , Fool ; They that commit thy faults , fly the remembrance .
My faults , Sir ! I would have you know I care notIf they were written here , here in my forehead .
Thy body is too little for the story , The lusts of which would fill another woman , Though she had Twins within her .
This is saucy ; Look you intrude no more , there lies your way .
Thou art my way , and I will tread upon thee , Till I find truth out .
What truth is that you look for ?
Thy long-lost honour : would the Gods had set meOne of their loudest bolts ; come tell me quickly , Do it without enforcement , and take heedYou swell me not above my temper .
How Sir ? where got you this report ?
Where there was people in every place .
They and the seconds of it are base people ; Believe them not , they lyed .
Do not play with mine anger , do not Wretch , I come to know that desperate Fool that drew theeFrom thy fair life ; be wise , and lay him open .
Unhand me , and learn manners , such anotherForgetfulness forfeits your life .
Quench me this mighty humour , and then tell meWhose Whore you are , for you are one , I know it.Let all mine honours perish but I'le find him , Though he lie lockt up in thy blood ; be sudden ; There is no facing it , and be not flattered ; The burnt air , when the Dog raigns , is not foulerThan thy contagious name , till thy repentance ( If the Gods grant thee any ) purge thy sickness .
Be gone , you are my Brother , that 's your safety .
I'le be a Wolf first ; 't is to be thy BrotherAn infamy below the sin of a Coward : I am as far from being part of thee , As thou art from thy vertue : seek a kindredMongst sensual beasts , and make a Goat thy Brother , A Goat is cooler ; will you tell me yet ?
If you stay here and rail thus , I shall tell you , I'le ha ' you whipt ; get you to your command , And there preach to your Sentinels , And tell them what a brave man you are ; I shall laughat you .
Y'are grown a glorious Whore ; where be yourFighters ? what mortal Fool durst raise thee to thisdaring , And I alive ? by my just Sword , h'ad saferBestride a Billow when the angry NorthPlows up the Sea , or made Heavens fire his food ; Work me no higher ; will you discover yet ?
The Fellow 's mad , sleep and speak sense .
Force my swollen heart no further ; I would savethee ; your great maintainers are not here , they darenot , would they were all , and armed , I would speakloud ; here 's one should thunder to 'em : will you tellme ? thou hast no hope to scape ; he that dares most , and damns away his soul to do thee service , willsooner fetch meat from a hungry Lion , than come torescue thee ; thou hast death about thee : h'asundone thine honour , poyson 'd thy vertue , and of alovely rose , left thee a canker .
Let me consider .
Do , whose child thou wert , Whose honour thou hast murdered , whose grave open 'd , And so pull 'd on the Gods , that in their justiceThey must restore him flesh again and life , And raise his dry bones to revenge his scandal .
The gods are not of my mind ; they had betterlet 'em lie sweet still in the earth ; they'l stink here .
Do you raise mirth out of my easiness ? Forsake me then all weaknesses of Nature , That make men women : Speak you whore , speak truth , Or by the dear soul of thy sleeping Father , This sword shall be thy lover : tell , or I'le kill thee : And when thou hast told all , thou wilt deserve it .
You will not murder me !
No , 't is a justice , and a noble one , To put the light out of such base offenders .
Help !
By thy foul self , no humane help shall help thee , If thou criest : when I have kill 'd thee , as I haveVow 'd to do , if thou confess not , naked as thou hastleftThine honour , will I leave thee , That on thy branded flesh the world may readThy black shame , and my justice ; wilt thou bend yet ?
Yes .
Up and begin your story .
Oh I am miserable .
'T is true , thou art , speak truth still .
I have offended , noble Sir : forgive me .
With what secure slave ?
Do not ask me Sir.Mine own remembrance is a misery too mightie for me .
Do not fall back again ; my sword 's unsheath 'd yet .
What shall I do ?
Be true , and make your fault less .
I dare not tell .
Tell , or I'le be this day a killing thee .
Will you forgive me then ?
Stay , I must ask mine honour first , I have too muchfoolish nature in me ; speak .
Is there none else here ?
None but a fearful conscience , that 's too many. Who is't ?
O hear me gently ; it was the King .
No more. My worthy father 's and my servicesAre liberally rewarded ! King , I thank thee , For all my dangers and my wounds , thou hast paid meIn my own metal : These are Souldiers thanks.How long have you liv 'd thus Evadne ?
Too long .
Too late you find it : can you be sorry ?
Would I were half as blameless .
Evadne , thou wilt to thy trade again .
First to my grave .
Would gods th'hadst been so blest : Dost thou not hate this King now ? prethee hate him : Couldst thou not curse him ? I command thee curse him , Curse till the gods hear , and deliver himTo thy just wishes : yet I fear Evadne ; You had rather play your game out .
No , I feelToo many sad confusions here to let in any loose flamehereafter .
Dost thou not feel amongst all those one brave angerThat breaks out nobly , and directs thine arm to killthis base King ?
All the gods forbid it .
No , all the gods require it , they are dishonoured in him .
'T is too fearful .
Y'are valiant in his bed , and bold enoughTo be a stale whore , and have your Madams nameDiscourse for Grooms and Pages , and hereafterWhen his cool Majestie hath laid you by , To be at pension with some needy SirFor meat and courser clothes , thus far you know no fear.Come , you shall kill him .
Good Sir !
And 'twere to kiss him dead , thou 'd smother him ; Be wise and kill him : Canst thou live and knowWhat noble minds shall make thee see thy selfFound out with every finger , made the shameOf all successions , and in this great ruineThy brother and thy noble husband broken ? Thou shalt not live thus ; kneel and swear to help meWhen I shall call thee to it , or by allHoly in heaven and earth , thou shalt not liveTo breath a full hour longer , not a thought : Come 't is a righteous oath ; give me thy hand , And both to heaven held up , swear by that wealthThis lustful thief stole from thee , when I say it , To let his foul soul out .
Here I swear it , And all you spirits of abused LadiesHelp me in this performance .
Enough ; this must be known to noneBut you and I Evadne ; not to your Lord , Though he be wise and noble , and a fellowDares step as far into a worthy action , As the most daring , I as far as Justice.Ask me not why. Farewell. [ Exit Mel .
Would I could say so to my black disgrace.Oh where have I been all this time ! how friended , That I should lose my self thus desperately , And none for pity shew me how I wandred ? There is not in the compass of the lightA more unhappy creature : sure I am monstrous , For I have done those follies , those mad mischiefs , Would dare a woman. O my loaden soul , Be not so cruel to me , choak not up [ Enter Amintor.The way to my repentance. O my Lord .
How now ?
My much abused Lord ! [ Kneels .
This can not be .
I do not kneel to live , I dare not hope it ; The wrongs I did are greater ; look upon meThough I appear with all my faults .
Stand up.This is no new way to beget more sorrow ; Heaven knows I have too many ; do not mock me ; Though I am tame and bred up with my wrongs , Which are my foster-brothers , I may leapLike a hand-wolf into my natural wilderness , And do an out-rage : pray thee do not mock me .
My whole life is so leprous , it infectsAll my repentance : I would buy your pardonThough at the highest set , even with my life : That slight contrition , that 's no sacrificeFor what I have committed .
Sure I dazle : There can not be a faith in that foul womanThat knows no God more mighty than her mischiefs : Thou dost still worst , still number on thy faults , To press my poor heart thus. Can I believeThere 's any seed of Vertue in that womanLeft to shoot up , that dares go on in sinKnown , and so known as thine is , O Evadne ! Would there were any safety in thy sex , That I might put a thousand sorrows off , And credit thy repentance : but I must not ; Thou hast brought me to the dull calamity , To that strange misbelief of all the world , And all things that are in it , that I fearI shall fall like a tree , and find my grave , Only remembring that I grieve .
My Lord , Give me your griefs : you are an innocent , A soul as white as heaven : let not my sinsPerish your noble youth : I do not fall hereTo shadow by dissembling with my tears , As all say women can , or to make lessWhat my hot will hath done , which heaven and youKnows to be tougher than the hand of timeCan cut from mans remembrance ; no I do not ; I do appear the same , the same Evadne , Drest in the shames I liv 'd in , the same monster.But these are names of honour , to what I am ; I do present my self the foulest creature , Most poysonous , dangerous , and despis 'd of men,
e 're bred , or Nilus ; I am hell , Till you , my dear Lord , shoot your light into me , The beams of your forgiveness : I am soul-sick , And [ wither ] with the fear of one condemn 'd , Till I have got your pardon .
Rise Evadne , Those heavenly powers that put this good into thee , Grant a continuance of it : I forgive thee ; Make thy self worthy of it , and take heed , Take heed Evadne this be serious ; Mock not the powers above , that can and dareGive thee a great example of their justiceTo all ensuing eyes , if thou plai'stWith thy repentance , the best sacrifice .
I have done nothing good to win belief , My life hath been so faithless ; all the creaturesMade for heavens honours have their ends , and good ones , All but the cousening Crocodiles , false women ; They reign here like those plagues , those killing soresMen pray against ; and when they die , like talesIll told , and unbeliev 'd , they pass away , And go to dust forgotten : But my Lord , Those short dayes I shall number to my rest , ( As many must not see me ) shall though too late , Though in my evening , yet perceive a will , Since I can do no good because a woman , Reach constantly at some thing that is near it ; I will redeem one minute of my age , Or like another Niobe I'le weep till I am water .
I am now dissolved : My frozen soul melts : may each sin thou hast , Find a new mercy : Rise , I am at peace : Hadst thou been thus , thus excellently good , Before that devil King tempted thy frailty , Sure thou hadst made a star : give me thy hand ; From this time I will know thee , and as farAs honour gives me leave , be thy Amintor : When we meet next , I will salute thee fairly , And pray the gods to give thee happy dayes : My charity shall go along with thee , Though my embraces must be far from thee.I should ha ' kill 'd thee , but this sweet repentanceLocks up my vengeance , for which thus I kiss thee , The last kiss we must take ; and would to heavenThe holy Priest that gave our hands together , Had given us equal Vertues : go Evadne , The gods thus part our bodies , have a careMy honour falls no farther , I am well then .
All the dear joyes here , and above hereafterCrown thy fair soul : thus I take leave my Lord , And never shall you see the foul EvadneTill sh'ave tryed all honoured means that maySet her in rest , and wash her stains away. [ Exeunt .
I can not tell how I should credit thisFrom you that are his enemy .
I am sure he said it to me , and I'le justifie itWhat way he dares oppose , but with my sword .
But did he break without all circumstanceTo you his foe , that he would have the FortTo kill me , and then escape ?
If he deny it , I'le make him blush .
It sounds incredibly .
I , so does every thing I say of late .
Not so Calianax .
Yes , I should sitMute , whilst a Rogue with strong arms cuts your throat .
Well , I will try him , and if this be trueI'le pawn my life I'le find it ; if't be false , And that you clothe your hate in such a lie , You shall hereafter doat in your own house , not in theCourt .
Why if it be a lie , Mine ears are false ; for I'le be sworn I heard it : Old men are good for nothing ; you were bestPut me to death for hearing , and free himFor meaning of it ; you would ha ' trusted meOnce , but the time is altered .
And will still where I may do with justice to the world ; You have no witness .
Yes , my self .
No more I mean there were that heard it .
How no more ? would you have more ? why amNot I enough to hang a thousand Rogues ?
But so you may hang honest men too if you please .
I may , 't is like I will do so ; there are a hundred willswear it for a need too , if I say it .
Such witnesses we need not .
And 't is hard if my Word can not hang a boysterous knave .
Enough ; where 's Strato ?
Sir !
Why where 's all the company ? call Amintor in .
, where 's my Brother , and Melantius ? Bid him come too , and Diphilus ; call all [ Exit Strato.That are without there : if he should desireThe combat of you , 't is not in the powerOf all our Laws to hinder it , unless we mean toquit 'em .
Why if you do think'Tis fit an old Man and a Counsellor , To fight for what he sayes , then you may grant it .
Come Sirs , Amintor thou art yet a Bridegroom , And I will use thee so : thou shalt sit down ;
sit , and you Amintor too ; This Banquet is for you , sir : Who has broughtA merry Tale about him , to raise a laughterAmongst our wine ? why Strato , where art thou ? Thou wilt chop out with them unseasonablyWhen I desire 'em not .
'T is my ill luck Sir , so to spend them then .
Reach me a boul of wine : Melantlius , thou art sad .
I should be Sir the merriest here , But I ha ' ne 're a story of mine ownWorth telling at this time .
Give me the Wine .
, I am now consideringHow easie 'twere for any man we trustTo poyson one of us in such a boul .
I think it were not hard Sir , for a Knave .
Such as you are .
I ' faith 'twere easie , it becomes us wellTo get plain dealing men about our selves , Such as you all are here : Amintor , to theeAnd to thy fair Evadne .
Have you thought of this Calianax ? [ Aside .
Yes marry have I .
And what 's your resolution ?
Ye shall have it soundly ?
Reach to Amintor , Strato .
Here my love , This Wine will do thee wrong , for it will setBlushes upon thy cheeks , and till thou dost afault , 'twere pity .
Yet I wonder muchOf the strange desperation of these men , That dare attempt such acts here in our State ; He could not escape that did it .
Were he known , unpossible .
It would be known , Melantius .
It ought to be , if he got then awayHe must wear all our lives upon his sword , He need not fly the Island , he must leave no one alive .
No , I should think no manCould kill me and scape clear , but that old man .
But I ! heaven bless me : I , should I my Liege ?
I do not think thou wouldst , but yet thou might'st , For thou hast in thy hands the means to scape , By keeping of the Fort ; he has , Melantius , and he haskept it well .
From cobwebs Sir , 'T is clean swept : I can find no other ArtIn keeping of it now , 't was ne 're besieg 'd since hecommanded .
I shall be sure of your good word , But I have kept it safe from such as you .
Keep your ill temper in , I speak no malice ; had my brother kept it I should ha'said as much .
You are not merry , brother ; drink wine , Sit you all still ! Calianax , [ Aside.I can not trust thus : I have thrown out wordsThat would have fetcht warm blood upon the cheeksOf guilty men , and he is never mov 'd , he knowsno such thing .
Impudence may scape , when feeble vertue is accus 'd .
He must , if he were guilty , feel an alterationAt this our whisper , whilst we point at him , You see he does not .
Let him hang himself , What care I what he does ; this he did say .
Melantius , you can not easily conceiveWhat I have meant ; for men that are in faultCan subtly apprehend when others aimeAt what they do amiss ; but I forgiveFreely before this man ; heaven do so too : I will not touch thee so much as with shameOf telling it , let it be so no more .
Why this is very fine .
I can not tellWhat 't is you mean , but I am apt enoughRudely to thrust into ignorant fault , But let me know it ; happily 't is noughtBut misconstruction , and where I am clearI will not take forgiveness of the gods , much lessof you .
Nay if you stand so stiff , I shall call back my mercy .
I want smoothnessTo thank a man for pardoning of a crime I never knew .
Not to instruct your knowledge , but to shew youmy ears are every where , you meant to kill me , and getthe Fort to scape .
Pardon me Sir ; my bluntness will be pardoned : You preserveA race of idle people here about you , Eaters , and talkers , to defame the worthOf those that do things worthy ; the man that utteredthisHad perisht without food , be't who it will , But for this arm that fenc't him from the foe.And if I thought you gave a faith to this , The plainness of my nature would speak more ; Give me a pardon ( for you ought to do't ) To kill him that spake this .
I , that will be the end of all , Then I am fairly paid for all my care and service .
That old man who calls me enemy , and of whom I ( Though I will never match my hate so low ) Have no good thought , would yet I think excuse me , And swear he thought me wrong 'd in this .
Who I , thou shameless fellow ! didst thou not speakto me of it thy self ?
O then it came from him .
From me ! who should it come from but from me ?
Nay , I believe your malice is enough , But I ha ' lost my anger. Sir , I hope you are wellsatisfied .
Lisip. Chear Amintor and his Lady ; there 's no soundComes from you ; I will come and do't my self .
You have done already Sir for me , I thank you .
Melantius , I do credit this from him , How slight so e 're you mak't .
'T is strange you should .
'T is strange he should believe an old mans word , That never lied in his life .
I talk not to thee ; Shall the wild words of this distempered man , Frantick with age and sorrow , make a breachBetwixt your Majesty and me ? 't was wrongTo hearken to him ; but to credit himAs much , at least , as I have power to bear.But pardon me , whilst I speak only truth , I may commend my self -- I have bestow'dMy careless blood with you , and should be lothTo think an action that would make me loseThat , and my thanks too : when I was a boy , I thrust my self into my Countries cause , And did a deed that pluckt five years from time , And stil 'd me man then : And for you my King , Your subjects all have fed by vertue of my arm.This sword of mine hath plow 'd the ground , And reapt the fruit in peace ; And your self have liv 'd at home in ease : So terrible I grew , that without swordsMy name hath fetcht you conquest , and my heartAnd limbs are still the same ; my will is greatTo do you service : let me not be paidWith such a strange distrust .
Melantius , I held it great injustice to believeThine Enemy , and did not ; if I did , I do not , let that satisfie : what struckWith sadness all ? More Wine !
A few fine words have overthrown my truth : Ah th'art a Villain .
Why thou wert better let me have the Fort , Dotard , I will disgrace thee thus for ever ; [ Aside.There shall no credit lie upon thy words ; Think better and deliver it .
My Liege , he 's at me now agen to do it ; speak , Deny it if thou canst ; examine himWhilst he 's hot , for he'l cool agen , he willforswear it .
This is lunacy I hope , Melantius .
He hath lost himselfMuch since his Daughter mist the happinessMy Sister gain 'd ; and though he call me Foe , I pityhim .
Pity ! a pox upon you .
Mark his disordered words , and at the Mask .
Diagoras knows he raged , and rail 'd at me , And cal 'd a Lady Whore , so innocentShe understood him not ; but it becomesBoth you and me too , to forgive distraction , Pardon him as I do .
I'le not speak for thee , for all thy cunning , if youwill be safe chop off his head , for there was neverknown so impudent a Rascal .
Some that love him , get him to bed : Why , pityshould not let age make it self contemptible ; we mustbe all old , have him away .
, the King believes you ; come , you shall goHome , and rest ; you ha ' done well ; you'l give it upWhen I have us 'd you thus a moneth I hope .
Now , now , 't is plain Sir , he does move me still ; He sayes he knows I'le give him up the Fort , When he has us 'd me thus a moneth : I am mad , Am I not still ?
Ha , ha , ha !
I shall be mad indeed , if you do thus ; Why would you trust a sturdy fellow there ( That has no vertue in him , all 's in his sword ) Before me ? do but take his weapons from him , And he 's an Ass , and I am a very fool , Both with him , and without him , as you use me .
Ha , ha , ha !
'T is well Calianax ; but if you useThis once again , I shall intreat some otherTo see your Offices be well discharg'd.Be merry Gentlemen , it grows somewhat late .
, thou wouldest be abed again .
Yes Sir .
And you Evadne ; let me take thee in my arms,
, and believe thou art as thou deservest tobe , my friend still , and for ever. Good Calianax , Sleep soundly , it will bring thee to thy self. [ Exeunt omnes. Manent Mel. and Cal .
Sleep soundly ! I sleep soundly now I hope , I could not be thus else. How dar'st thou stayAlone with me , knowing how thou hast used me ?
You can not blast me with your tongue , And that 's the strongest part you have about you .
I do look for some great punishment for this , For I begin to forget all my hate , And tak't unkindly that mine enemyShould use me so extraordinarily scurvily .
I shall melt too , if you begin to take
Thou'lt anger me again ; thou wretched rogue , Meant me no hurt ! disgrace me with the King ; Lose all my Offices ! this is no hurt , Is it ? I prethee what dost thou call hurt ?
To poyson men because they love me not ; To call the credit of mens Wives in question ; To murder children betwixt me and land ; this isall hurt .
All this thou think'st is sport ; For mine is worse : but use thy will with me ; For betwixt grief and anger I could cry .
Be wise then , and be safe ; thou may'st revenge .
I o'th ' King ? I would revenge of thee .
That you must plot your self .
I am a fine plotter .
The short is , I will hold thee with the KingIn this perplexity , till peevishnessAnd thy disgrace have laid thee in thy grave : But if thou wilt deliver up the Fort , I'le take thy trembling body in my arms , And bear thee over dangers ; thou shalt hold thy wontedstate .
If I should tell the King , can'st thou deny't again ?
Try and believe .
Nay then , thou can'st bring any thing about : Thou shalt have the Fort .
Why well , here let our hate be buried , andThis hand shall right us both ; give me thy aged breastto compass .
Nay , I do not love thee yet : I can not well endure to look on thee : And if I thought it were a courtesie , Thou should'st not have it : but I am disgrac 'd ; My Offices are to be ta'ne away ; And if I did but hold this Fort a day , I do believe the King would take it from me , And give it thee , things are so strangely carried ; Nere thank me for't ; but yet the King shall knowThere was some such thing i n't I told him of ; And that I was an honest man .
Hee'l buy that knowledge very dearly. [ Enter Diphilus.What news with thee ?
This were a night indeed to do it in ; The King hath sent for her .
She shall perform it then ; go Diphilus , And take from this good man , my worthy friend , The Fort ; he'l give it thee .
Ha ' you got that ?
Art thou of the same breed ? canst thou denyThis to the King too ?
With a confidence as great as his .
Faith , like enough .
Away , and use him kindly .
Touch not me , I hate the whole strain : if thoufollow me a great way off , I'le give thee up theFort ; and hang your selves .
Be gone .
He 's finely wrought. [ Exeunt Cal. Diph .
This is a night in spite of AstronomersTo do the deed in ; I will wash the stainThat rests upon our House , off with his blood .
Melantius , now assist me if thou beestThat which thou say'st , assist me : I have lostAll my distempers , and have found a rage so pleasing ; help me .
Who can see him thus , And not swear vengeance ? what 's the matter friend ?
Out with thy sword ; and hand in hand with meRush to the Chamber of this hated King , And sink him with the weight of all his sins to hellfor ever .
'Twere a rash attempt , Not to be done with safety : let your reasonPlot your revenge , and not your passion .
If thou refusest me in these extreams , Thou art no friend : he sent for her to me ; By Heaven to me ; my self ; and I must tell yeI love her as a stranger ; there is worthIn that vile woman , worthy things , Melantius ; And she repents. I'le do't my self alone , Though I be slain. Farewell .
He'l overthrow my whole design with madness:
, think what thou doest ; I dare as much asvalour ; But 't is the King , the King , the King , Amintor , With whom thou fightest ; I know he 's honest , [ Aside.And this will work with him .
I can not tellWhat thou hast said ; but thou hast charm 'd my swordOut of my hand , and left me shaking here defenceless .
I will take it up for thee .
What a wild beast is uncollected man ! The thing that we call Honour , bears us allHeadlong unto sin , and yet it self is nothing .
Alas , how variable are thy thoughts !
Just like my fortunes : I was run to thatI purpos 'd to have chid thee for.Some Plot I did distrust thou hadst against the KingBy that old fellows carriage : but take heed , There is not the least limb growing to a King , But carries thunder in it .
I have none against him .
Why , come then , and still remember we maynot think revenge .
I will remember .
Evadne and a Gentleman .
Sir , is the King abed ?
Madam , an hour ago .
Give me the key then , and let none be near ; 'T is the Kings pleasure .
I understand you Madam , would 'twere mine.I must not wish good rest unto your Ladiship .
You talk , you talk .
'T is all I dare do , Madam ; but the King will wake , and then .
Saving your imagination , pray good night Sir .
A good night be it then , and a long one Madam ; I am gone .
Who 's that ?
O you sleep soundly Sir !
My dear Evadne , I have been dreaming of thee ; come to bed .
I am come at length Sir , but how welcome ?
What pretty new device is this Evadne ? What do you tie me to you by my love ? This is a quaint one : Come my dear and kiss me ; I'le be thy Mars to bed my Queen of Love : Let us be caught together , that the Gods may see , And envy our embraces .
Stay Sir , stay , You are too hot , and I have brought you PhysickTo temper your high veins .
Prethee to bed then ; let me take it warm , There you shall know the state of my body better .
I know you have a surfeited foul body , And you must bleed .
Bleed !
I , you shall bleed : lie still , and if the Devil , Your lust will give you leave , repent : this steelComes to redeem the honour that you stole , King , my fair name , which nothing but thy deathCan answer to the world .
How 's this Evadne ?
I am not she : nor bear I in this breastSo much cold Spirit to be call 'd a Woman : I am a Tyger : I am any thingThat knows not pity : stir not , if thou dost , I'le take thee unprepar 'd ; thy fears upon thee , That make thy sins look double , and so send thee ( By my revenge I will ) to look those tormentsPrepar 'd for such black souls .
Thou dost not mean this : 't is impossible : Thou art too sweet and gentle .
No , I am not : I am as foul as thou art , and can numberAs many such hells here : I was once fair , Once I was lovely , not a blowing RoseMore chastly sweet , till tho [ u ] , thou , thou , foulCanker , ( Stir not ) didst poyson me : I was a world of vertue , Till your curst Court and you ( hell bless you for't ) With your temptations on temptationsMade me give up mine honour ; for which ( King ) I am come to kill thee .
No .
I am .
Thou art not.I prethee speak not these things ; thou art gentle , And wert not meant thus rugged .
Peace and hear me.Stir nothing but your tongue , and that for mercyTo those above us ; by whose lights I vow , Those blessed fires that shot to see our sin , If thy hot soul had substance with thy blood , I would kill that too , which being past my steel , My tongue shall teach : Thou art a shameless Villain , A thing out of the overchange of Nature ; Sent like a thick cloud to disperse a plagueUpon weak catching women ; such a tyrantThat for his Lust would sell away his Subjects , I , all his heaven hereafter .
Hear Evadne , Thou soul of sweetness ! hear , I am thy King .
Thou art my shame ; lie still , there 's none about you , Within your cries ; all promises of safetyAre but deluding dreams : thus , thus , thou foul man , Thus I begin my vengeance. [ Stabs him .
Hold Evadne ! I do command thee hold .
I do not mean Sir , To part so fairly with you ; we must changeMore of these love-tricks yet .
What bloody villainProvok't thee to this murther ?
Thou , thou monster .
Oh !
Thou kept'st me brave at Court , and Whor 'd me ; Then married me to a young noble Gentleman ; And Whor 'd me still .
Evadne , pity me .
Hell take me then ; this for my Lord Amintor ; This for my noble brother : and this strokeFor the most wrong 'd of women. [ Kills him .
Oh ! I die .
Die all our faults together ; I forgive thee. [ Exit .
1. Come now she 's gone , let 's enter , the King expectsit , and will be angry.2. 'T is a fine wench , we'I have a snap at her one of thesenights as she goes from him.1. Content : how quickly he had done with her ! I seeKings can do no more that way than other mortal people.2. How fast he is ! I can not hear him breathe.1. Either the Tapers give a feeble light , or he looks verypale.2. And so he does , pray Heaven he be well.Let 's look : Alas ! he 's stiffe , wounded and dead : Treason , Treason ! 1. Run forth and call. [ Exit Gent.2. Treason , Treason ! 1. This will be laid on us : who can believeA Woman could do this ?
Cleon and Lisippus .
How now , where 's the Traytor ? 1. Fled , fled away ; but there her woful act lies still .
Her act ! a Woman !
Where 's the body ? 1. There .
Farewel thou worthy man ; there were two bondsThat tyed our loves , a Brother and a King ; The least of which might fetch a flood of tears : But such the misery of greatness is , They have no time to mourn ; then pardon me.Sirs , which way went she ? [ Enter Strato .
Never follow her , For she alas ! was but the instrument.News is now brought in , that MelantiusHas got the Fort , and stands upon the wall ; And with a loud voice calls those few that passAt this dead time of night , deliveringThe innocent of this act .
Gentlemen , I am your King .
We do acknowledge it .
I would I were not : follow all ; for this must havea sudden stop. [ Exeunt
Melant. Diph. and Cal. on the wall .
If the dull people can believe I am arm 'd , Be constant Diphilus ; now we have time , Either to bring our banisht honours home , Or create new ones in our ends .
I fear not ; My spirit lies not that way. Courage Calianax .
Would I had any , you should quickly know it .
Speak to the people ; thou art eloquent .
'T is a fine eloquence to come to the gallows ; You were born to be my end ; the Devil take you.Now must I hang for company ; 't is strangeI should be old , and neither wise nor valiant .
Lisip. Diag. Cleon , Strat. Guard .
See where he stands as boldly confident , As if he had his full command about him .
He looks as if he had the bet [ t ] er cause ; Sir , Under your gracious pardon let me speak it ; Though he be mighty-spirited and forwardTo all great things ; to all things of that dangerWorse men shake at the telling of ; yet certainlyI do believe him noble , and this actionRather pull 'd on than sought ; his mind was everAs worthy as his hand .
'T is my fear too ; Heaven forgive all : summon him Lord Cleon .
Ho from the walls there .
Worthy Cleon , welcome ; We could have wisht you here Lord ; you are honest .
Well , thou art as flattering a knave , though I darenot tell you so. [ Aside .
Melantius !
Sir .
I am sorry that we meet thus ; our old loveNever requir 'd such distance ; pray HeavenYou have not left your self , and sought this safetyMore out of fear than honour ; you have lostA noble Master , which your faith Melantius , Some think might have preserv 'd ; yet you know best .
When time was I was mad ; some that daresFight I hope will pay this Rascal .
Royal young man , whose tears look lovely on thee ; Had they been shed for a deserving one , They had been lasting monuments. Thy Brother , Whil'st he was good , I call 'd him King , and serv 'd himWith that strong faith , that most unwearied valour ; Pul 'd people from the farthest Sun to seek him ; And by his friendship , I was then his souldier ; But since his hot pride drew him to disgrace me , And brand my noble actions with his lust , ( That never cur 'd dishonour of my Sister , Base stain of Whore ; and which is worse , The joy to make it still so ) like my self ; Thus have I flung him off with my allegiance , And stand here mine own justice to revengeWhat I have suffered in him ; and this old manWrong 'd almost to lunacy .
Who I ? you 'd draw me in : I have had no wrong , I do disclaim ye all .
The short is this ; 'T is no ambition to lift up my self , Urgeth me thus ; I do desire againTo be a subject , so I may be freed ; If not , I know my strength , and will unbuildThis goodly Town ; be speedy , and be wise , in a reply .
Be sudden Sir to tieAll again ; what 's done is past recal , And past you to revenge ; and there are thousandsThat wait for such a troubled hour as this ; Throw him the blank .
Melantius , write in that thy choice , My Seal is at it .
It was our honour drew us to this act , Not gain ; and we will only work our pardon .
Put my name in too .
You disclaim 'd us but now , Calianax .
That 's all one ; I'le not be hanged hereafter by a trick ; I'le have it in .
You shall , you shall ; Come to the back gate , and we'l call you King , And give you up the Fort .
Away , away. [ Exeunt Omnes .
Aspatia in mans apparel .
This is my fatal hour ; heaven may forgiveMy rash attempt , that causelesly hath laidGriefs on me that will never let me rest : And put a Womans heart into my brest ; It is more honour for you that I die ; For she that can endure the miseryThat I have on me , and be patient too , May live , and laugh at all that you can do.God save you Sir. [ Enter Servant .
And you Sir ; what 's your business ?
With you Sir now , to do me the OfficeTo help me to you [ r ] Lord .
What , would you serve him ?
I'le do him any service ; but to haste , For my affairs are earnest , I desire to speak withhim .
Sir , because you are in such haste , I would be lothdelay you any longer : you can not .
It shall become you tho ' to tell your Lord .
Sir , he will speak with no body .
This is most strange : art thou gold proof ? there'sfor thee ; help me to him .
Pray be not angry Sir , I'le do my best. [ Exit .
How stubbornly this fellow answer 'd me ! There is a vile dishonest trick in man , More than in women : all the men I meetAppear thus to me , are harsh and rude , And have a subtilty in every thing , Which love could never know ; but we fond womenHarbor the easiest and smoothest thoughts , And think all shall go so ; it is unjustThat men and women should be matcht together .
Amintor and his man .
Where is he !
There my Lord .
What would you Sir ?
Please it your Lordship to command your manOut of the room ; shall deliver thingsWorthy your hearing .
Leave us .
O that that shape should bury falshood in it. [ Aside .
Now your will Sir .
When you know me , my Lord , you needs must guessMy business ! and I am not hard to know ; For till the change of War mark 'd this smooth faceWith these few blemishes people would call meMy Sisters Picture , and her mine ; in short , I am the brother to the wrong 'd Aspatia .
The wrong 'd Aspatia ! would thou wert so tooUnto the wrong 'd Amintor ; let me kissThat hand of thine in honour that I bearUnto the wrong 'd Aspatia : here I standThat did it ; would he could not ; gentle youthLeave me , for there is something in thy looksThat calls my sins in a most hideous formInto my mind ; and I have grief enoughWithout thy help .
I would I could with credit : Since I was twelve years old I had not seenMy Sister till this hour ; I now arriv 'd ; She sent for me to see her Marriage , A woful one : but they that are above , Have ends in every thing ; she us 'd few words , But yet enough to make me understandThe baseness of the injury you did her.That little training I have had is War ; I may behave my self rudely in Peace ; I would not though ; I shall not need to tell youI am but young ; and you would be loth to loseHonour that is not easily gain 'd again.Fairly I mean to deal ; the age is strictFor single combats , and we shall be stoptIf it be publish't : if you like your sword , Use it ; if mine appear a better to you , Change ; for the ground is this , and this the timeTo end our difference .
Charitable youth , If thou be'st such , think not I will maintainSo strange a wrong ; and for thy Sisters sake , Know that I could not think that desperate thingI durst not do ; yet to enjoy this worldI would not see her ; for beholding thee , I am I know not what ; if I have oughtThat may content thee , take it and be gone ; For death is not so terrible as thou ; Thine eyes shoot guilt into me .
Thus she sworeThou would'st behave thy self , and give me wordsThat would fetch tears into mine eyes , and soThou dost indeed ; but yet she bade me watch , Lest I were cousen 'd , and be sure to fight ere Ireturn 'd .
That must not be with me ; For her I'le die directly , but against her will neverhazard it .
You must be urg 'd ; I do not deal uncivilly with those thatDare to fight ; but such a one as youMust be us 'd thus. [ She strikes him .
Prethee youth take heed ; Thy Sister is a thing to me so muchAbove mine honour , that I can endu [ r ] eAll this ; good gods -- a blow I can endure ; But stay not , lest thou draw a timely death upon thyself .
Thou art some prating fellow , One that hath studyed out a trick to talkAnd move soft-hearted people ; to be kickt , [ She kicks him.Thus to be kickt -- why should he be so slow [ Aside.In giving me my death ?
A man can bearNo more and keep his flesh ; forgive me then ; I would endure yet if I could ; now shewThe spirit thou pretendest , and understandThou hast no honour to live : [ They fight.What dost thou mean ? thou canst not fight : The blows thou mak'st at me are quite besides ; And those I offer at thee , thou spread'st thine arms , And tak'st upon thy breast , Alas ! defenceless .
I have got enough , And my desire ; there 's no place so fit for me to dieas here .
Evadne .
Amintor ; I am loaden with eventsThat flie to make thee happy ; I have joyes [ Her hands bloody with a knife.That in a moment can call back thy wrongs , And settle thee in thy free state again ; It is Evadne still that follows thee , but not hermischiefs .
Thou canst not fool me to believe agen ; But thou hast looks and things so full of news thatI am staid .
Noble Amintor , put off thy amaze ; Let thine eyes loose , and speak , am I not fair ? Looks not Evadne beauteous with these rites now ? Were those hours half so lovely in thine eyes , When our hands met before the holy man ? I was too foul within to look fair then ; Since I knew ill , I was not free till now .
There is presage of some important thingAbout thee , which it seems thy tongue hath lost : Thy hands are bloody , and thou hast a knife .
In this consists thy happiness and mine ; Joy to Amintor , for the King is dead .
Those have most power to hurt us that we love , We lay our sleeping lives within their arms.Why , thou hast rais 'd up mischief to this height , And found out one to out-name thy other faults ; Thou hast no intermission of thy sins , But all thy life is a continual ill ; Black is thy colour now , disease thy nature.Joy to Amintor ! thou hast toucht a life , The very name of which had power to chainUp all my rage , and calm my wildest wrongs .
'T is done ; and since I could not find a wayTo meet thy love so clear , as through his life , I can not now repent it .
Could'st thou procure the Gods to speak to me , To bid me love this woman , and forgive , I think I should fall out with them ; beholdHere lies a youth whose wounds bleed in my brest , Sent by his violent Fate to fetch his deathFrom my slow hand : and to augment my woe , You now are present stain 'd with a Kings bloodViolently shed : this keeps night here , And throws an unknown wilderness about me .
Oh , oh , oh !
No more , pursue me not .
Forgive me then , and take me to thy bed.We may not part .
Forbear , be wise , and let my rage go this way .
'T is you that I would stay , not it .
Take heed , it will return with me .
If it must be , I shall not fear to meet it ; take me home .
Thou monster of cruelty , forbear .
For heavens sake look more calm ; Thine eyes are sharper than thou canst make thy sword .
Away , away , thy knees are more to me than violence.I am worse than sick to see knees follow meFor that I must not grant ; for heavens sake stand .
Receive me then.Amint. I dare not stay thy language ; In midst of all my anger and my grief , Thou dost awake something that troubles me , And sayes I lov 'd thee once ; I dare not stay ; There is no end of womens reasoning. [ Leaves her .
Amintor , thou shalt love me once again ; Go , I am calm ; farewell ; and peace for ever .
whom thou hat'st will die for thee. [ Kills her self .
I have a little humane nature yetThat 's left for thee , that bids me stay thy hand. [ Returns .
Thy hand was welcome , but came too late ; Oh I am lost ! the heavy sleep makes haste. [ She dies .
Oh , oh , oh !
This earth of mine doth tremble , and I feelA stark affrighted motion in my blood ; My soul grows weary of her house , and IAll over am a trouble to my self ; There is some hidden power in these dead thingsThat calls my flesh into'em ; I am cold ; Be resolute , and bear'em company : There 's something yet which I am loth to leave.There 's man enough in me to meet the fearsThat death can bring , and yet would it were done ; I can find nothing in the whole discourseOf death , I durst not meet the boldest way ; Yet still betwixt the reason and the act , The wrong I to Aspatia did stands up , I have not such a fault to answer , Though she may justly arm with scornAnd hate of me , my soul will part less troubled , When I have paid to her in tears my sorrow : I will not leave this act unsatisfied , If all that 's left in me can answer it .
Was it a dream ? there stands Amintor still : Or I dream still .
How dost thou ? speak , receive my love , and help : Thy blood climbs up to his old place again : There 's hope of thy recovery .
Did you not name Aspatia ?
I did .
And talkt of tears and sorrow unto her ?
'T is true , and till these happy signs in theeDid stay my course , 't was thither I was going .
Th'art there already , and these wounds are hers : Those threats I brought with me , sought not revenge , But came to fetch this blessing from thy hand , I am Aspatia yet .
Dare my soul ever look abroad agen ?
I shall live Amintor ; I am well : A kind of healthful joy wanders within me .
The world wants lines to excuse thy loss : Come let me bear thee to some place of help .
Amintor thou must stay , I must rest here , My strength begins to disobey my will.How dost thou my best soul ? I would fain live , Now if I could : would'st thou have loved me then ?
Alas ! all that I am 's not worth a hair from thee .
Give me thy hand , mine hands grope up and down , And can not find thee ; I am wondrous sick : Have I thy hand Amintor ?
Thou greatest blessing of the world , thou hast .
I do believe thee better than my sense.Oh ! I must go , farewell .
She swounds : Aspatia help , for Heavens sake water ; Such as may chain life for ever to this frame .
, speak : what no help ? yet I fool , I'le chafe her temples , yet there 's nothing stirs ; Some hidden Power tell her that Amintor calls , And let her answer me : Aspatia , speak.I have heard , if there be life , but bowThe body thus , and it will shew it self.Oh she is gone ! I will not leave her yet.Since out of justice we must challenge nothing ; I'le call it mercy if you'l pity me , You heavenly powers , and lend for some few years , The blessed soul to this fair seat agen.No comfort comes , the gods deny me too.I'le bow the body once agen : Aspatia ! The soul is fled for ever , and I wrongMy self , so long to lose her company.Must I talk now ? Here 's to be with thee love. [ Kills himself .
Servant .
This is a great grace to my Lord , to have the newKing come to him ; I must tell him , he is entring.O Heaven help , help ;
Lysip. Melant. Cal. Cleon , Diph. Strato .
Where 's Amintor ?
O there , there .
How strange is this !
What should we do here ?
These deaths are such acquainted things with me , That yet my heart dissolves not. May I standStiff here for ever ; eyes , call up your tears ; This is Amintor : heart he was my friend ; Melt , now it flows ; Amintor , give a wordTo call me to thee .
Oh !
Melantius calls his friend Amintor ; Oh thy armsAre kinder to me than thy tongue ; Speak , speak .
What ?
That little word was worth all the soundsThat ever I shall hear agen .
O brother ! here lies your Sister slain ; You lose your self in sorrow there .
Why Diphilus , it isA thing to laugh at in respect of this ; Here was my Sister , Father , Brother , Son ; All that I had ; speak once again ; What youth lies slain there by thee ?
'T is Aspatia.My senses fade , let me give up my soulInto thy bosom .
Aspatia !
I never did repent the greatness of my heart till now ; It will not burst at need .
My daughter dead here too ! and you have all fine newtricks to grieve ; but I ne 're knew any but directcrying .
I am a pratler , but no more .
Hold Brother .
Stop him .
Fie ; how unmanly was this offer in you ! Does this become our strain ?
I know not what the mat [ t ] er is , but I amGrown very kind , and am friends with you ; You have given me that among you will kill meQuickly ; but I'le go home , and live as long as I can .
His spirit is but poor that can be keptFrom death for want of weapons.Is not my hand a weapon good enoughTo stop my breath ? or if you tie down those , I vow Amintor I will never eat , Or drink , or sleep , or have to do with thatThat may preserve life ; this I swear to keep .

and Thrasiline .
Here 's not Lords nor Ladies .
Credit me Gentlemen , I wonder at it.They receiv 'd strict charge from the King to attend here : Besides it was boldly published , that no Officer shouldforbid any Gentlemen that desire to attend and hear .
Can you guess the cause ?
Sir , it is plain about the Spanish Prince , that 's cometo marry our Kingdoms Heir , and be our Soveraign .
Many ( that will seem to know much ) say , she looksnot on him like a Maid in Love .
O Sir , the multitude ( that seldom know any thingbut their own opinions ) speak that they would have ; butthe Prince , before his own approach , receiv 'd so manyconfident messages from the State , that I think she'sresolv 'd to be rul 'd .
Sir , it is thought , with her he shall enjoy both theseKingdoms of Cicilie and Calabria .
Sir , it is ( without controversie ) so meant. But 'twillbe a troublesome labour for him to enjoy both theseKingdoms , with safetie , the right Heir to one of themliving , and living so vertuously , especially the peopleadmiring the bravery of his mind , and lamenting hisinjuries .
Who , Philaster ?
Yes , whose Father we all know , was by our lateKing of Calabria , unrighteously deposed from hisfruitful Cicilie. My self drew some blood in thoseWars , which I would give my hand to be washed from .
Sir , my ignorance in State-policy , will not let meknow why Philaster being Heir to one of these Kingdoms , the King should suffer him to walk abroad with such freeliberty .
Sir , it seems your nature is more constant than toenquire after State news. But the King ( of late ) made ahazard of both the Kingdoms , of Cicilie and his own , with offering but to imprison Philaster. At which the Citywas in arms , not to be charm 'd down by any State-order orProclamation , till they saw Philaster ride through thestreets pleas 'd , and without a guard ; at which they threwtheir Hats , and their arms from them ; some to makebonefires , some to drink , all for his deliverance. Which ( wise men say ) is the cause , the King labours to bring inthe power of a Foreign Nation to aw his own with. [ Enter Galatea , Megra , and a Lady .
See , the Ladies , what 's the first ?
A wise and modest Gentlwoman that attends the Princess .
The second ?
She is one that may stand still discreetly enough , andill favour'dly Dance her Measure ; simper when she isCourted by her Friend , and slight her Husband .
The last ?
Marry I think she is one whom the State keeps forthe Agents of our confederate Princes : she 'll cog and liewith a whole army before the League shall break : hername is common through the Kingdom , and the Trophiesof her dishonour , advanced beyond Hercules-pillars.She loves to try the several constitutions of mens bodies ; and indeed has destroyed the worth of her own body , bymaking experiment upon it , for the good of theCommon-wealth .
She 's a profitable member .
Peace , if you love me : you shall see these Gentlemenstand their ground , and not Court us .
What if they should ?
What if they should ?
Nay , let her alone ; what if they should ? why , ifthey should , I say , they were never abroad : whatForeigner would do so ? it writes them directlyuntravel 'd .
Why , what if they be ?
What if they be ?
Good Madam let her go on ; what if they be ? Whyif they be I will justifie , they can not maintaindiscourse with a judicious Lady , nor make a Leg , nor say Excuse me .
Ha , ha , ha .
Do you laugh Madam ?
Your desires upon you Ladies .
Then you must sit beside us .
I shall sit near you then Lady .
Near me perhaps : But there 's a Lady indures nostranger ; and to me you appear a very strange fellow .
Me thinks he 's not so strange , he would quickly beacquainted .
Peace , the King. [ Enter King , Pharamond , Arethusa , and Train .
This will be hardly done .
It must be ill done , if it be done .
When 't is at best , 'twill be but half done , Whilst so brave a Gentleman 's wrong 'd and flung off .
I fear .
Who does not ?
I fear not for my self , and yet I fear too : Well , we shall see , we shall see : no more .
Miraculous .
This speech calls him Spaniard , being nothing butA large inventory of his own commendations. [ Enter Philaster .
I wonder what 's his price ? For certainly he 'll tellhimself he has so prais 'd his shape : But here comes onemore worthy those large speeches , than the largespeaker of them ? let me be swallowed quick , if I canfind , in all the Anatomy of yon mans vertues , one sinewsound enough to promise for him , he shall be Constable.By this Sun , he 'll ne 're make King unless it be for trifles , in my poor judgment .
Right Noble Sir , as low as my obedience , And with a heart as Loyal as my knee , I beg your favour .
Rise , you have it Sir .
Mark but the King how pale he looks with fear.Oh ! this same whorson Conscience , how it jades us !
Speak your intents Sir .
Shall I speak 'um freely ? Be still my royal Soveraign .
As a subjectWe give you freedom .
Now it heats .
Then thus I turnMy language to you Prince , you foreign man.Ne 're stare nor put on wonder , for you mustIndure me , and you shall. This earth you tread upon ( A dowry as you hope with this fair Princess , Whose memory I bow to ) was not leftBy my dead Father ( Oh , I had a Father ) To your inheritance , and I up and living , Having my self about me and my sword , The souls of all my name , and memories , These arms and some few friends , besides the gods , To part so calmly with it , and sit still , And say I might have been ! I tell thee Pharamond , When thou art King , look I be dead and rotten , And my name ashes ; For , hear me Pharamond , This very ground thou goest on , this fat earth , My Fathers friends made fertile with their faiths , Before that day of shame , shall gape and swallowThee and thy Nation , like a hungry grave , Into her hidden bowels : Prince , it shall ; By Nemesis it shall .
He 's mad beyond cure , mad .
Here 's a fellow has some fire in 's veins : The outlandish Prince looks like a Tooth-drawer .
Sir , Prince of Poppingjayes , I'le make it well appearTo you I am not mad .
You displease us.You are too bold .
No Sir , I am too tame , Too much a Turtle , a thing born without passion , A faint shadow , that every drunken cloud sails over , And makes nothing .
I do not fancy this , Call our Physicians : sure he is somewhat tainted .
I do not think 'twill prove so .
H'as given him a general purge already , for all theright he has , and now he means to let him blood : Beconstant Gentlemen ; by these hilts I'le run hishazard , although I run my name out of theKingdom .
Peace , we are one soul .
What you have seen in me , to stir offence , I can not find , unless it be this LadyOffer 'd into mine arms , with the succession , Which I must keep though it hath pleas 'd your furyTo mutiny within you ; without disputingYour Genealogies , or taking knowledgeWhose branch you are. The King will leave it me ; And I dare make it mine ; you have your answer .
If thou wert sole inheritor to him , That made the world his ; and couldst see no sunShine upon any but thine : were PharamondAs truly valiant , as I feel him cold , And ring 'd among the choicest of his friends , Such as would blush to talk such serious follies , Or back such bellied commendations , And from this present , spight of all these bugs , You should hear further from me .
Sir , you wrong the Prince : I gave you not this freedom to brave our best friends , You deserve our frown : go to , be better temper 'd .
It must be Sir , when I am nobler us 'd .
Ladyes , This would have been a pattern of succession , Had he ne 're met this mischief. By my life , He is the worthiest the true name of manThis day within my knowledge .
I can not tell what you may call your knowledge , But the other is the man set in mine eye ; Oh ! 't is a Prince of wax .
A Dog it is .
Philaster , tell me , The injuries you aim at in your riddles .
If you had my eyes Sir , and sufferance , My griefs upon you and my broken fortunes , My want 's great , and now nought but hopes and fears , My wrongs would make ill riddles to be laught at.Dare you be still my King and right me not ?
Give me your wrongs in private. [ They whisper .
Take them , and ease me of a load would bow strong Atlas .
He dares not stand the shock .
I can not blame , him , there 's danger in't. Every manin this age , has not a soul of Crystal for all men toread their actions through : mens hearts and faces areso far asunder , that they hold no intelligence. Do butview yon stranger well , and you shall see a Feaverthrough all his bravery , and feel him shake like a trueTenant ; if he give not back his Crown again , upon thereport of an Elder Gun , I have no augury .
Go to : Be more your self , as you respect our favour : You'I stir us else : Sir , I must have you knowThat y'are and shall be at our pleasure , what fashion weWill put upon you : smooth your brow , or by the gods .
I am dead Sir , y'are my fate : it was not ISaid I was not wrong 'd : I carry all about me , My weak stars led me to all my weak fortunes.Who dares in all this presence speak ( that isBut man of flesh and may be mortal ) tell meI do not most intirely love this Prince , And honour his full vertues !
Sure he 's possest .
Yes , with my Fathers spirit ; It 's here O King ! A dangerous spirit ; now he tells me King , I was a Kings heir , bids me be a King , And whispers to me , these be all my Subjects.'Tis strange , he will not let me sleep , but divesInto my fancy , and there gives me shapesThat kneel , and do me service , cry me King : But I'le suppress him , he 's a factious spirit , And will undo me : noble Sir , [ your ] hand , I am yourservant .
Away , I do not like this : I'le make you tamer , or I'le dispossess youBoth of life and spirit : For this timeI pardon your wild speech , without so muchAs your imprisonment. [ Ex. King , Pha. and Are .
I thank you Sir , you dare not for the people .
Ladies , what think you now of this brave fellow ?
A pretty talking fellow , hot at hand ; but eye yonstranger , is not he a fine compleat Gentleman ? O thesestrangers , I do affect them strangely : they do the raresthome things , and please the fullest ! as I live , couldlove all the Nation over and over for his sake .
Pride comfort your poor head-piece Lady : 't is aweak one , and had need of a Night-cap .
See how his fancy labours , has he not spokeHome , and bravely ? what a dangerous trainDid he give fire to ! How he shook the King , Made his soul melt within him , and his bloodRun into whay ! it stood upon his brow , Like a cold winter dew .
Gentlemen , You have no suit to me ? I am no minion : You stand ( methinks ) like men that would be Courtiers , If you could well be fiatter 'd at a price , Not to undo your Children : y'are all honest : Go get you home again , and make your CountryA vertuous Court , to which your great ones may , In their Diseased age , retire , and live recluse .
How do you worthy Sir ?
Well , very well ; And so well , that if the King please , I findI may live many years .
The King must please , Whilst we know what you are , and who you are , Your wrongs and [ injuries ] : shrink not , worthy Sir , But add your Father to you : in whose name , We 'll waken all the gods , and conjure upThe rods of vengeance , the abused people , Who like to raging torrents shall swell high , And so begirt the dens of these Male-dragons , That through the strongest safety , they shall begFor mercy at your swords point .
Friends , no more , Our years may he corrupted : 'T is an ageWe dare not trust our wills to : do you love me ?
Do we love Heaven and honour ?
My Lord Dion , you hadA vertuous Gentlewoman call 'd you Father ; Is she yet alive ?
Most honour 'd Sir , she is : And for the penance but of an idle dream , Has undertook a tedious Pilgrimage. [ Enter a Lady .
Is it to me , or any of these Gentlemen you come ?
To you , brave Lord ; the Princess would intreatYour present company .
The Princess send for me ! y'are mistaken .
If you be call 'd Philaster , 't is to you .
Kiss her hand , and say I will attend her .
Do you know what you do ?
Yes , go to see a woman .
But do you weigh the danger you are in ?
Danger in a sweet face ? By Jupiter I must not fear a woman .
But are you sure it was the Princess sent ? It may be some foul train to catch your life .
I do not think it Gentlemen : she 's noble , Her eye may shoot me dead , or those true redAnd white friends in her face may steal my soul out : There 's all the danger i n't : but be what may , Her single name hath arm 'd me. [ Ex. Phil .

Arethusa and a Lady .
Comes he not ?
Madam ?
Will Philaster come ?
Dear Madam , you were wontTo credit me at first .
But didst thou tell me so ? I am forgetful , and my womans strengthIs so o'recharg 'd with danger like to growAbout my Marriage that these under-thingsDare not abide in such a troubled sea : How look't he , when he told thee he would come ?
Why , well .
And not a little fearful ?
Fear Madam ? sure he knows not what it is .
You are all of his Faction ; the whole CourtIs bold in praise of him , whilst IMay live neglected : and do noble things , As fools in strife throw gold into the Sea , Drown 'd in the doing : but I know he fears .
Fear ? Madam ( me thought ) his looks hid moreOf love than fear .
Of love ? To whom ? to you ? Did you deliver those plain words I sent , With such a winning gesture , and quick lookThat you have caught him ?
Madam , I mean to you .
Of love to me ? Alas ! thy ignoranceLets thee not see the crosses of our births : Nature , that loves not to be questionedWhy she did this , or that , but has her ends , And knows she does well ; never gave the worldTwo things so opposite , so contrary , As he and I am : If a bowl of bloodDrawn from this arm of mine , would poyson thee , A draught of his would cure thee. Of love to me ?
Madam , I think I hear him .
Bring him in : You gods that would not have your dooms withstood , Whose holy wisdoms at this time it is , To make the passion of a feeble maidThe way unto your justice , I obey. [ Enter Phil .
Here is my Lord Philaster .
Oh ! 't is well : Withdraw your self .
Madam , your messengerMade me believe , you wisht to speak with me .
'T is true Philaster , but the words are such , I have to say , and do so ill beseemThe mouth of woman , that I wish them said , And yet am loth to speak them. Have you knownThat I have ought detracted from your worth ? Have I in person wrong 'd you ? or have setMy baser instruments to throw disgraceUpon your vertues ?
Never Madam you .
Why then should you in such a publick place , Injure a Princess and a scandal layUpon my fortunes , fam 'd to be so great : Calling a great part of my dowry in question .
Madam , this truth which I shall speak , will be
I could afford my self to have no rightTo any thing you wish 'd .
knowI must enjoy these Kingdoms .
Madam , both ?
Both or I die : by Fate I die Philaster , If I not calmly may enjoy them both .
I would do much to save that Noble life : Yet would be loth to have posterityFind in our stories , that Philaster gaveHis right unto a Scepter , and a Crown , To save a Ladies longing .
Nay then hear : I must , and will have them , and more .
What more ?
Or lose that little life the gods prepared , To trouble this poor piece of earth withall .
Madam , what more ?
Turn then away thy face .
No .
Do .
I can not endure it : turn away my face ? I never yet saw enemy that looktSo dreadful , but that I thought my selfAs great a Basilisk as he ; or spakeSo horribly , but that I thought my tongueBore Thunder underneath , as much as his : Nor beast that I could turn from : shall I thenBegin to fear sweet sounds ? a Ladies voice , Whom I do love ? Say you would have my life , Why , I will give it you ; for it is of meA thing so loath 'd , and unto you that askOf so poor use , that I shall make no priceIf you intreat , I will unmov'dly hear .
Yet for my sake a little bend thy looks .
I do .
Then know I must have them and thee .
And me ?
Thy love : without which , all the LandDiscovered yet , will serve me for no use , But to be buried in .
Is't possible ?
With it , it were too little to bestowOn thee : Now , though thy breath doth strike me dead ( Which know it may ) I have unript my breast .
Madam , you are too full of noble thoughts , To lay a train for this contemned life , Which you may have for asking : to suspectWere base , where I deserve no ill : love you ! By all my hopes I do , above my life : But how this passion should proceed from youSo violently , would amaze a man , that would be jealous .
Another soul into my body shot , Could not have fill 'd me with more strength and spirit , Than this thy breath : but spend not hasty time , In seeking how I came thus : 't is the gods , The gods , that make me so ; and sure our loveWill be the nobler , and the better blest , In that the secret justice of the godsIs mingled with it. Let us leave and kiss , Lest some unwelcome guest should fall betwixt us , And we should part without it .
'Twill be illI should abide here long .
'T is true , and worseYou should come often : How shall we deviseTo hold intelligence ? That our true lovers , On any new occasion may agree , what path is best totread ?
'T is well , no more .
Madam , the Prince is come to do his service .
What will you do Philaster with your self ?
Why , that which all the gods have appointed out for me .
Dear , hide thy self. Bring in the Prince .
Hide me from Pharamond ! When Thunder speaks , which is the voice of Jove , Though I do reverence , yet I hide me not ; And shall a stranger Prince have leave to bragUnto a forreign Nation , that he made Philasterhide himself ?
He can not know it .
Though it should sleep for ever to the world , It is a simple sin to hide my self , Which will for ever on my conscience lie .
Then good Philaster , give him scope and wayIn what he saies : for he is apt to speakWhat you are loth to hear : for my sake do .
I will. [ Enter Pharamond .
My Princely Mistress , as true lovers ought , I come to kiss these fair hands ; and to shewIn outward Ceremonies , the dear loveWrit in my heart .
If I shall have an answer no directlier , I am gone .
To what would he have an answer ?
To his claim unto the Kingdom .
Sirrah , I forbear you before the King .
Good Sir , do so still , I would not talk with you .
But now the time is fitter , do but offerTo make mention of right to any Kingdom , Though it be scarce habitable .
Good Sir , let me go .
And by my sword .
Peace Pharamond : if thou --
Leave us Philaster .
I have done .
You are gone , by heaven I'le fetch you back .
You shall not need .
What now ?
Know Pharamond , I loath to brawl with such a blast as thou , Who art nought but a valiant voice : But ifThou shalt provoke me further , men shall sayThou wert , and not lament it .
Do you slightMy greatness so , and in the Chamber of the Princess !
It is a place to which I must confessI owe a reverence : but wer't the Church , I , at the Altar , there 's no place so safe , Where thou dar'st injure me , but I dare kill thee : And for your greatness ; know Sir , I can graspYou , and your greatness thus , thus into nothing : Give not a word , not a word back : Farewell. [ Exit Phi .
'T is an odd fellow Madam , we must stopHis mouth with some Office , when we are married .
You were best make him your Controuler .
I think he would discharge it well. But Madam , I hope our hearts are knit ; and yet so slowThe Ceremonies of State are , that 'twill be longBefore our hands be so : If then you please , Being agreed in heart , let us not waitFor dreaming for me , but take a little stolnDelights , and so prevent our joyes to come .

Philaster and Bellario .
And thou shalt find her honourable boy , Full of regard unto thy tender youth , For thine own modesty ; and for my sake , Apter to give , than thou wilt be to ask , I , or deserve .
Sir , you did take me up when I was nothing ; And only yet am something , by being yours ; You trusted me unknown ; and that which you are aptTo conster a simple innocence in me , Perhaps , might have been craft ; the cunning of a boyHardened in lies and theft ; yet ventur 'd you , To part my miseries and me : for which , I never can expect to serve a LadyThat bears more honour in her breast than you .
But boy , it will prefer thee ; thou art young , And bearest a childish overflowing loveTo them that clap thy cheeks , and speak thee fair yet : But when thy judgment comes to rule those passions , Thou wilt remember best those careful friendsThat plac 'd thee in the noblest way of life ; She is a Princess I prefer thee to .
In that small time that I have seen the world , I never knew a man hasty to partWith a servant he thought trusty ; I rememberMy Father would prefer the boys he keptTo greater men than he , but did it not , Till they were grown too sawcy for himself .
Why gentle boy , I find no fault at all in thy behaviour .
Sir , if I have madeA fault of ignorance , instruct my youth ; I shall be willing , if not apt to learn ; Age and experience will adorn my mindWith larger knowledge : And if I have doneA wilful fault , think me not past all hopeFor once ; what Master holds so strict a handOver his boy , that he will part with himWithout one warning ? Let me be correctedTo break my stubbornness if it be so , Rather than turn me off , and I shall mend .
Thy love doth plead so prettily to stay , That ( trust me ) I could weep to part with thee.Alas ! I do not turn thee off ; thou knowestIt is my business that doth call thee hence , And when thou art with her thou dwel'st with me : Think so , and 't is so ; and when time is full , That thou hast well discharged this heavy trust , Laid on so weak a one , I will againWith joy receive thee ; as I live , I will ; Nay weep not , gentle boy ; 'T is more than timeThou didst attend the Princess .
I am gone ; But since I am to part with you my Lord , And none knows whether I shall live to doMore service for you ; take this little prayer ; Heaven bless your loves , your fights , all your designs.May sick men , if they have your wish , be well ; And Heavens hate those you curse , though I be one. [ Exit .

Why should these Ladies stay so long ? They mustcome this way ; I know the Queen imployes 'em not , for the Reverend Mother sent me word they would allbe for the Garden.

Dear Lady , can you love ?
Dear , Prince , how dear ! I ne 're cost you a Coachyet , nor put you to the dear repentance of a Banquet ; here 's no Scarlet Sir , to blush the sin out it was given

You mistake me Lady .
Lord , I do so ; would you or I could help it .
Do Ladies of this Country use to give no more respectto men of my full being ?
Full being ! I understand you not , unless your Gracemeans growing to fatness ; and then your only remedy ( upon my knowledge , Prince ) is in a morning a Cup ofneat White-wine brew 'd with Carduus , then fast tillsupper , about eightyou may eat ; use exercise , and keep a Sparrow-hawk , youcan shoot in a Tiller ; but of all , your Grace must flie

What would your Grace talk of ?
Of some such pretty subject as your self.I'le go no further than your eye , or lip , There 's theme enough for one man for an age .
Sir , they stand right , and my lips are yet even , Smooth , young enough , ripe enough , red enough , Or my glass wrongs me .
O they are two twin 'd Cherries died in blushes , Which those fair suns above , with their bright beamsReflect upon , and ripen : sweetest beauty , Bow down those branches , that the longing taste , Of the faint looker on , may meet those blessings , And taste and live .
O delicate sweet Prince ; She that hath snow enough about her heart , To take the wanton spring of ten such lines off , May be a Nun without probation.Sir , you have in such neat poetry , gathered a kiss , That if I had but five lines of that number , Such pretty begging blanks , I should commendYour fore-head , or your cheeks , and kiss you too .
Do it in prose ; you can not miss it Madam .
I shall , I shall .
By my life you shall not.I'le prompt you first : Can you do it now ?
Methinks 't is easie , now I ha ' do n't before ; But yet I should stick at it .
Stick till to morrow.I'le ne'r part you sweetest. But we lose time , Can you love me ?
Love you my Lord ? How would you have melove you ?
I'le teach you in a short sentence , cause I will notload your memory , that is all ; love me , and lie withme .
Was it lie with you that you said ? 'T is impossible .
Not to a willing mind , that will endeavour ; if I donot teach you to do it as easily in one night , as you'lgo to bed , I'le lose my Royal blood for't .
Why Prince , you have a Lady of your own , thatyet wants teaching .
I'le sooner teach a Mare the old measures , than teachher any thing belonging to the function ; she 's afraid tolie with her self , if she have but any masculineimaginations about her ; I know when we are married , I must ravish her .
By my honour , that 's a foul fault indeed , but timeand your good help will wear it out Sir .

Love Madam ? I know not what it is .
Canst thou know grief , and never yet knew'st love ? Thou art deceiv 'd boy ; does he speak of meAs if he wish 'd me well ?
If it be love , To forget all respect of his own friends , In thinking of your face ; if it be loveTo sit cross arm 'd and sigh away the day , Mingled with starts , crying your name as loudAnd hastily , as men i'the streets do fire : If it be love to weep himself away , When he but hears of any Lady dead , Or kill 'd , because it might have been your chance ; If when he goes to rest ( which will not be ) 'Twixt every prayer he saies , to name you onceAs others drop a bead , be to be in love ; Then Madam , I dare swear he loves you .
O y'are a cunning boy , and taught to lie , For your Lords credit ; but thou knowest , a lie , That bears this sound , is welcomer to me , Than any truth that saies he loves me not.Lead the way Boy : Do you attend me too ; 'T is thy Lords business hasts me thus ; Away. [ Exeunt .

Sir , I have asked , and her women swear she is within , but they I think are bawds ; I told 'em I must speakwith her : they laught , and said their Lady lay speechless.I said , my business was important ; they said their Ladywas about it : I grew hot , and cryed my business was amatter that concern 'd life and death ; they answered , sowas sleeping , at which their Lady was ; I urg 'd again , shehad scarce time to be so since last I saw her ; they smil'dagain , and seem 'd to instruct me , that sleeping wasnothing but lying down and winking : Answers more directI could not get : in short Sir , I think she is not there .

No man can fit your palat , but the Prince.Thou most ill shrowded rottenness ; thou pieceMade by a Painter and a Pothecary ; Thou troubled sea of lust ; thou wilderness , Inhabited by wild thoughts ; thou swoln cloudOf Infection ; them ripe Mine of all Diseases ; Thou all Sin , all Hell , and last , all Devils , tell me , Had you none to pull on with your courtesies , But he that must be mine , and wrong my Daughter ? By all the gods , all these , and all the Pages , And all the Court shall hoot thee through the Court , Fling rotten Oranges , make ribald Rimes , And sear thy name with Candles upon walls : Do you laugh Lady Venus ?
Faith Sir , you must pardon me ; I can not chuse but laugh to see you merry.If you do this , O King ; nay , if you dare do it ; By all these gods you swore by , and as manyMore of my own ; I will have fellows , and suchFellows in it , as shall make noble mirth ; The Princess , your dear Daughter , shall stand by meOn walls , and sung in ballads , any thing : Urge me no more , I know her , and her haunts , Her layes , leaps , and outlayes , and will discover all ; Nay will dishonour her. I know the boyShe keeps , a handsome boy ; about eighteen : Know what she does with him , where , and when.Come Sir , you put me to a womans madness , The glory of a fury ; and if I do notDo it to the height ?
What boy is this she raves at ?
Alas ! good minded Prince , you know not these things ? I am loth to reveal 'em. Keep this faultAs you would keep your health from the hot airOf the corrupted people , or by heaven , I will not fall alone : what I have known , Shall be as publick as a print : all tonguesShall speak it as they do the language theyAre born in , as free and commonly ; I'le set itLike a prodigious star for all to gaze at , And so high and glowing , that other Kingdoms farand ForreignShall read it there , nay travel with it , till they findNo tongue to make it more , nor no more people ; And then behold the fall of your fair Princess .
Has she a boy ?
So please your Grace I have seen a boy waitOn her , a fair boy .

there I leave you Gentlemen .
Nay we'l go wander with you. [ Exeunt .
Cle. Di. and Thra .
Nay doubtless 't is true .
I , and 't is the godsThat rais 'd this Punishment to scourge the KingWith his own issue : Is it not a shameFor us , that should write noble in the land ; For us , that should be freemen , to beholdA man , that is the bravery of his age,
, prest down from his Royal right , By this regardless King ; and only look , And see the Scepter ready to be castInto the hands of that lascivious Lady , That lives in lust with a smooth boy , now to beMarried to yon strange Prince , who , but that peoplePlease to let him be a Prince , is born a slave , In that which should be his most noble part , His mind ?
That man that would not stir with you , To aid Philaster , let the gods forget , That such a Creature walks upon the earth .
Philaster is too backward i n't himself ; The Gentry do await it , and the peopleAgainst their nature are all bent for him , And like a field of standing Corn , that 's mov'dWith a stiff gale , their heads bow all one way .
The only cause that draws Philaster backFrom this attempt , is the fair Princess love , Which he admires and we can now confute .
Perhaps he'l not believe it .
Why Gentlemen , 't is without question so .
I 't is past speech , she lives dishonestly.But how shall we , if he be curious , workUpon his faith ?
We all are satisfied within our selves .
Since it is true , and tends to his own good , I'le make this new report to be my knowledge , I'le say I know it , nay , I'le swear I saw it .
It will be best .
'Twill move him. [ Enter Philaster .
Here he comes. Good morrow to your honour , We have spent some time in seeking you .
My worthy friends , You that can keep your memories to knowYour friend in miseries , and can not frownOn men disgrac 'd for vertue : A good dayAttend you all. What service may I do worthy youracceptation ?
My good Lord , We come to urge that vertue which we knowLives in your breast , forth , rise , and make a head , The Nobles , and the people are all dull'dWith this usurping King : and not a manThat ever heard the word , or knew such a thingAs vertue , but will second your attempts .
How honourable is this love in youTo me that have deserv 'd none ? Know my friends ( You that were born to shame your poor Philaster , With too much courtesie ) I could affordTo melt my self in thanks ; but my designsAre not yet ripe , suffice it , that ere longI shall imploy your loves : but yet the time is short ofwhat I would .
The time is fuller Sir , than you expect ; That which hereafter will not perhaps be reach'dBy violence , may now be caught ; As for the King , You know the people have long hated him ; But now the Princess , whom they lov 'd .
Why , what of her ?
Is loath 'd as much as he .
By what strange means ?
She 's known a Whore .
Thou lyest .
My Lord --
Thou lyest , [ Offers to draw and is held.And thou shalt feel it ; I had thought thy mindHad been of honour ; thus to rob a LadyOf her good name , is an infectious sin , Not to be pardon 'd ; be it false as hell , 'Twill never be redeem 'd , if it be sownAmongst the people , fruitful to increaseAll evil they shall hear. Let me alone , That I may cut off falshood , whilst it springs.Set hills on hills betwixt me and the manThat utters this , and I will scale them all , And from the utmost top fall on his neck , Like Thunder from a Cloud .
This is most strange ; Sure he does love her .
I do love fair truth : She is my Mistress , and who injures her , Draws vengeance from me Sirs , let go my arms .
Nay , good my Lord be patient .
Sir , remember this is your honour 'd friend , That comes to do his service , and will shew youWhy he utter 'd this .
I ask you pardon Sir , My zeal to truth made me unmannerly : Should I have heard dishonour spoke of you , Behind your back untruly , I had beenAs much distemper 'd , and enrag 'd as now .
But this my Lord is truth .
O say not so , good Sir forbear to say so , 'T is the truth that all womenkind is false ; Urge it no more , it is impossible ; Why should you think the Princess light ?
Why , she was taken at it .
'T is false , O Heaven 't is false : it can not be , Can it ? Speak Gentlemen , for love of truth speak ; Is't possible ? can women all be damn 'd ?
Why no , my Lord .
Why then it can not be .
And she was taken with her boy .
What boy ?
A Page , a boy that serves her .
Oh good gods , a little boy ?
I , know you him my Lord ?
Hell and sin know him ? Sir , you are deceiv 'd ; I'le reason it a little coldly with you ; If she were lustful , would she take a boy , That knows not yet desire ? she would have oneShould meet her thoughts and knows the sin he acts , Which is the great delight of wickedness ; You are abus 'd , and so is she , and I .
How you my Lord ?
Why all the world 's abus'dIn an unjust report .
Oh noble Sir your vertuesCannot look into the subtil thoughts of woman.In short my Lord , I took them : I my self .
Now all the Devils thou didst flie from my rage , Would thou hadst ta'ne devils ingendring plagues : When thou didst take them , hide thee from my eyes , Would thou hadst taken Thunder on thy breast , When thou didst take them , or been strucken dumbFor ever : that this foul deed might have slept insilence .
Have you known him so ill temper 'd ?
Never before .
The winds that are let loose , From the four several corners of the earth , And spread themselves all over sea and land , Kiss not a chaste one. What friend bears a swordTo run me through ?
Why , my Lord , are you so mov 'd at this ?
When any falls from vertue I am distract , I have an interest i n't .
But good my Lord recal your self , And think what 's best to be done .
I thank you. I will do it ; Please you to leave me , I'le consider of it : Tomorrow I will find your lodging forth , And give you answerThe readiest way .
All the gods direct you .
He was extream impatient .
It was his vertue and his noble mind. [ Exeunt Di. Cle. and Thra .
I had forgot to ask him where he took them , I'le follow him. O that I had a seaWithin my breast , to quench the fire I feel ; More circumstances will but fan this fire ; It more afflicts me now , to know by whomThis deed is done , than simply that 't is done : And he that tells me this is honourable , As far from lies , as she is far from truth.O that like beasts , we could not grieve our selves , With that we see not ; Bulls and Rams will fight , To keep their Females standing in their sight ; But take 'em from them , and you take at onceTheir spleens away ; and they will fall againUnto their Pastures , growing fresh and fat , And taste the waters of the springs as sweet , As 't was before , finding no start in sleep.But miserable man ; See , see you gods , [ Enter Bellario.He walks still ; and the face you let him wearWhen he was innocent , is still the same , Not blasted ; is this justice ? Do you meanTo intrap mortality , that you allowTreason so smooth a brow ? I can not nowThink he is guilty .
Health to you my Lord ; The Princess doth commend her love , her life , And this unto you .
Oh Bellario , Now I perceive she loves me , she does shew itIn loving thee my boy , she has made thee brave .
My Lord she has attired me past my wish , Past my desert , more fit for her attendant , Though far unfit for me , who do attend .
Thou art grown courtly boy. O let all womenThat love black deeds , learn to dissemble here , Here , by this paper she does write to me , As if her heart were Mines of AdamantTo all the world besides , but unto me , A maiden snow that melted with my looks.Tell me my boy how doth the Princess use thee ? For I shall guess her love to me by that .
Scarce like her servant , but as if I wereSomething allied to her ; or had preserv'dHer life three times by my fidelity.As mothers fond do use their only sons ; As I'de use one , that 's left unto my trust , For whom my life should pay , if he met harm , So she does use me .
Why , this is wondrous well : But what kind language does she feed thee with ?
Why , she does tell me , she will trust my youthWith all her loving secrets ; and does call meHer pretty servant , bids me weep no moreFor leaving you : shee'l see my servicesRegarded ; and such words of that soft strain , That I am nearer weeping when she endsThan ere she spake .
This is much better still .
Are you ill my Lord ?
Ill ? No Bellario .
Me thinks your wordsFall not from off your tongue so evenly , Nor is there in your looks that quietness , That I was wont to see .
Thou art deceiv 'd boy : And she stroakes thy head ?
Yes .
And she does clap thy cheeks ?
She does my Lord .
And she does kiss thee boy ? ha !
How my Lord ?
She kisses thee ?
Not so my Lord .
Come , come , I know she does .
No by my life .
Why then she does not love me ; come , she does , I had her do it ; I charg 'd her by all charmsOf love between us , by the hope of peaceWe should enjoy , to yield thee all delightsNaked , as to her bed : I took her oathThou should'st enjoy her : Tell me gentle boy , Is she not paralleless ? Is not her breathSweet as Arabian winds , when fruits are ripe ? Are not her breasts two liquid Ivory balls ? Is she not all a lasting Mine of joy ?
I , now I see why my disturbed thoughtsWere so perplext. When first I went to her , My heart held augury ; you are abus 'd , Some villain has abus 'd you ; I do seeWhereto you tend ; fall Rocks upon his head , That put this to you ; 't is some subtil train , To bring that noble frame of yours to nought .
Thou think'st I will be angry with thee ; ComeThou shalt know all my drift , I hate her more , Than I love happiness , and plac 'd thee there , To pry with narrow eyes into her deeds ; Hast thou discover 'd ? Is she fain to lust , As I would wish her ? Speak some comfort to me .
My Lord , you did mistake the boy you sent : Had she the lust of Sparrows , or of Goats ; Had she a sin that way , hid from the world , Beyond the name of lust , I would not aidHer base desires ; but what I came to knowAs servant to her , I would not reveal , to makemy life last ages .
Oh my heart ; this is a salve worse than the main disease.Tell me thy thoughts ; for I will know the leastThat dwells within thee , or will rip thy heartTo know it ; I will see thy thoughts as plain , As I do know thy face .
Why , so you do.She is ( for ought I know ) by all the gods , As chaste as Ice ; but were she foul as HellAnd I did know it , thus ; the breath of Kings , The points of Swords , Tortures nor Bulls of Brass , Should draw it from me .
Then 't is no time to dally with thee ; I will take thy life , for I do hate thee ; I could cursethee now .
If you do hate you could not curse me worse ; The gods have not a punishment in storeGreater for me , than is your hate .
Fie , fie , so young and so dissembling ; Tell me when and where thou di [ d ] st enjoy her , Or let plagues fall on me , if I destroy thee not .
Heaven knows I never did : and when I lieTo save my life , may I live long and loath'd.Hew me asunder , and whilst I can thinkI'le love those pieces you have cut away , Better than those that grow : and kiss these limbs , Because you made 'em so .
Fearest thou not death ? Can boys contemn that ?
Oh , what boy is heCan be content to live to be a manThat sees the best of men thus passionate , thuswithout reason ?
Oh , but thou dost not know what 't is to die .
Yes , I do know my Lord ; 'T is less than to be born ; a lasting sleep , A quiet resting from all jealousie ; A thing we all pursue ; I know besides , It is but giving over of a game that must be lost .
But there are pains , false boy , For perjur 'd souls ; think but on these , and thenThy heart will melt , and thou wilt utter all .
May they fall all upon me whilst I live , If I be perjur 'd , or have ever thoughtOf that you charge me with ; if I be false , Send me to suffer in those punishments you speak of ; kill me .
Oh , what should I do ? Why , who can but believe him ? He does swearSo earnestly , that if it were not true , The gods would not endure him. Rise Bellario , Thy protestations are so deep ; and thouDost look so truly , when thou utterest them , That though I [ know ] 'em false , as were my hopes , I can not urge thee further ; but thou wertTo blame to injure me , for I must loveThy honest looks , and take no revenge uponThy tender youth ; A love from me to theeIs firm , what ere thou dost : It troubles meThat I have call 'd the blood out of thy cheeks , That did so well become thee : but good boyLet me not see thee more ; something is done , That will distract me , that will make me mad , If I behold thee : if thou tender'st me , Let me not see thee .
I will fly as farAs there is morning , ere I give distasteTo that most honour 'd mind. But through these tearsShed at my hopeless parting , I can seeA world of Treason practis 'd upon you , And her and me. Farewel for evermore ; If you shall hear , that sorrow struck me dead , And after find me Loyal , let there beA tear shed from you in my memorie , And I shall rest at peace. [ Exit Bel .

I marvel my boy comes not back again ; But that I know my love will question himOver and over ; how I slept , wak 'd , talk 'd ; How I remembred him when his dear nameWas last spoke , and how , when I sigh 'd , wept , sung , And ten thousand such ; I should be angry at his stay. [ Enter King .
What are your meditations ? who attends you ?
None but my single self , I need no Guard , I do no wrong , nor fear none .
Tell me : have you not a boy ?
Yes Sir .
What kind of boy ?
A Page , a waiting boy .
A handsome boy ?
I think he be not ugly : Well qualified , and dutiful , I know him , I took him not for beauty .
He speaks , and sings and plays ?
Yes Sir .
About Eighteen ?
I never ask 'd his age .
Is he full of service ?
By your pardon why do you ask ?
Put him away .
Sir ?
Put him away , h'as done you that good service , Shames me to speak of .
Good Sir let me understand you .
If you fear me , shew it in duty ; put away that boy .
Let me have reason for it Sir , and thenYour will is my command .
Do not you blush to ask it ? Cast him off , Or I shall do the same to you. Y'are oneShame with me , and so near unto my self , That by my life , I dare not tell my self , What you , my self have done .
What have I done my Lord ?
'T is a new language , that all love to learn , The common people speak it well already , They need no Grammer ; understand me well , There be foul whispers stirring ; cast him off ! And suddenly do it : Farewel. [ Exit King .
Where may a Maiden live securely free , Keeping her Honour safe ? Not with the living , They feed upon opinions , errours , dreams , And make 'em truths : they draw a nourishmentOut of defamings , grow upon disgraces , And when they see a vertue fortifiedStrongly above the battery of their tongues ; Oh , how they cast to sink it ; and defeated ( Soul sick with Poyson ) strike the MonumentsWhere noble names lie sleeping : till they sweat , And the cold Marble melt .

Peace to your fairest thoughts , dearest Mistress .
Oh , my dearest servant I have a War within me .
He must be more than man , that makes these CrystalsRun into Rivers ; sweetest fair , the cause ; And as I am your slave , tied to your goodness , Your creature made again from what I was , And newly spirited , I'le right your honours .
Oh , my best love ; that boy !
What boy ?
The pretty boy you gave me .
What of him ?
Must be no more mine .
Why ?
They are jealous of him .
Jealous , who ?
The King .
Oh , my fortune , Then 't is no idle jealousie. Let him go .
Oh cruel , are you hard hearted too ? Who shall now tell you , how much I lov 'd you ; Who shall swear it to you , and weep the tears I send ? Who shall now bring you Letters , Rings , Bracelets , Lose his health in service ? wake tedious nightsIn stories of your praise ? Who shall singYour crying Elegies ? And strike a sad soulInto senseless Pictures , and make them mourn ? Who shall take up his Lute , and touch it , tillHe crown a silent sleep upon my eye-lid , Making me dream and cry , Oh my dear , dear Philaster .
Oh my heart ! Would he had broken thee , that made thee knowThis Lady was not Loyal. Mistress , forgetThe boy , I'le get thee a far better .
Oh never , never such a boy again , as my Bellario .
'T is but your fond affection .
With thee my boy , farewel for ever , All secrecy in servants : farewel faith , And all desire to do well for it self : Let all that shall succeed thee , for thy wrongs , Sell and betray chast love .
And all this passion for a boy ?
He was your boy , and you put him to me , And the loss of such must have a mourning for .

How , my Lord ?
False Arethusa ! Hast thou a Medicine to restore my wits , When I have lost 'em ? If not , leave to talk , and do thus .
Do what Sir ? would you sleep ?
For ever Arethusa. Oh you gods , Give me a worthy patience ; Have I stoodNaked , alone the shock of many fortunes ? Have I seen mischiefs numberless , and mightyGrow li [ k ] e a sea upon me ? Have I takenDanger as stern as death into my bosom , And laught upon it , made it but a mirth , And flung it by ? Do I live now like him , Under this Tyrant King , that languishingHears his sad Bell , and sees his Mourners ? Do IBear all this bravely , and must sink at lengthUnder a womans falshood ? Oh that boy , That cursed boy ? None but a villain boy , to easeyour lust ?
Nay , then I am betray 'd , I feel the plot cast for my overthrow ; Oh I am wretched .
Be merciful ye gods and strike me dead ; What way have I deserv 'd this ? make my breastTransparent as pure Crystal , that the worldJealous of me , may see the foulest thoughtMy heart holds.

Why do you gods place us above the rest ; To be serv 'd , flatter 'd , and ador 'd till weBelieve we hold within our hands your Thunder , And when we come to try the power we have , There 's not a leaf shakes at our threatnings.I have sin 'd 't is true , and here stand to be punish 'd ; Yet would not thus be punish 'd ; let me chuseMy way , and lay it on .
He Articles with the gods ; would some body woulddraw bonds , for the performance of Covenantsbetwixt them .
Pha. Galatea , and Megra .
What , is she found ?
No , we have ta'ne her Horse.He gallopt empty by : there 's some Treason ; You Galatea rode with her into the wood ; why leftyou her ?
She did command me .
Command ! you should not .
'Twould ill become my Fortunes and my BirthTo disobey the Daughter of my King .
Y'are all cunning to obey us for our hurt , But I will have her .
If I have her not , By this hand there shall be no more Cicily .
What will he carry it to Spain in 's pocket ?
I will not leave one man alive , but the King , A Cook and a Taylor .
Yet you may do well to spare your Ladies Bed-fellow , and her you may keep for a Spawner .
I see the injuries I have done must be reveng 'd .
Sir , this is not the way to find her out .
Run all , disperse your selves : the man that finds her , Or ( if she be kill 'd ) the Traytor ; I'le [ make ] him great .
I know some would give five thousand pounds to find her .
Come let us seek .
Each man a several way , here I my self .
Come Gentlemen we here .
Lady you must go search too .
I had rather be search 'd my self. [ Exeunt omnes .
Arethusa .
Where am I now ? Feet find me out a way , Without the counsel of my troubled head , I'le follow you boldly about these woods , O 're mountains , thorow brambles , pits , and flouds : Heaven I hope will ease me. I am sick .
Bellario .
Yonder 's my Lady ; Heaven knows I want nothing ; Because I do not wish to live , yet IWill try her Charity. Oh hear , you that have plenty , From that flowing store , drop some on dry ground ; see , The lively red is gone to guard her heart ; I fear she faints. Madam look up , she breaths not ; Open once more those rosie twins , and sendUnto my Lord , your latest farewell ; Oh , she stirs : How is it Madam ? Speak comfort .
'T is not gently done , To put me in a miserable life , And hold me there ; I pray thee let me go , I shall do best without thee ; I am well .
Philaster .
I am to blame to be so much in rage , I'le tell her coolely , when and where I heardThis killing truth. I will be temperateIn speaking , and as just in hearing.Oh monstrous ! Tempt me not ye gods , good godsTempt not a frail man , what 's he , that has a heartBut he must ease it here ?
My Lord , help the Princess .
I am well , forbear .
Let me love lightning , let me be embrac'dAnd kist by Scorpions , or adore the eyesOf Basilisks , rather than trust to tongues , And shrink these veins up ; stick me here a stoneLasting to ages in the memoryOf this damn 'd act. Hear me you wicked ones , You have put the hills on fire into this breast , Not to be quench 'd with tears , for which may guiltSit on your bosoms ; at your meals , and beds , Despair await you : what , before my face ? Poyson of Aspes between your lips ; DiseasesBe your best issues ; Nature make a CurseAnd throw it on you .
Dear Philaster , leaveTo be enrag 'd , and hear me .
I have done ; Forgive my passion , not the calm 'd sea , When Æolus locks up his windy brood , Is less disturb 'd than I , I'le make you know it.Dear Arethusa , do but take this sword , And search how temperate a heart I have ; Then you and this your boy , may live and raignIn lust without control ; Wilt thou Bellario ? I prethee kill me ; thou art poor , and maistNourish ambitious thoughts , when I am dead : This way were freer ; Am I raging now ? If I were mad I should desire to live ; Sirs , feel my pulse ; whether have you knownA man in a more equal tune to die ?
Alas my Lord , your pulse keeps madmans time , So does your tongue .
You will not kill me then ?
Kill you ?
Not for a world .
I blame not thee,
; thou hast done but that , which godsWould have transform 'd themselves to do ; be gone , Leave me without reply ; this is the lastOf all our meeting. Kill me with this sword ; Be wise , or worse will follow : we are twoEarth can not bear at once. Resolve to do , or suffer .
If my fortunes be so good to let me fallUpon thy hand , I shall have peace in death.Yet tell me this , will there be no slanders , No jealousies in the other world , no ill there ?
No .
Shew me then the way .
Then guideMy feeble hand , you that have power to do it , For I must perform a piece of justice. If your youthHave any way offended Heaven , let prayersShort and effectual reconcile you to it .
I am prepared .
Country-fellow .
I'le see the King if he be in the Forest , I have huntedhim these two hours ; if I should come home and notsee him my Sisters would laugh at me ; I can see nothingbut people better horst than my self , that outrideme ; I can hear nothing but shouting. These Kings hadneed of good brains , this whooping is able to put a meanman out of his wits. There 's a Courtier with his sworddrawn , by this hand upon a woman , I think .
Are you at peace ?
With Heavens and Earth .
May they divide thy soul and body ?
Hold dastard , strike a Woman ! th'art a craven Iwarrant thee , thou wouldst be loth to play half a dozenof venies at wasters with a good fellow for a broken head .
Leave us good friend .
What ill bred man art thou , to intrude thy selfUpon our private sports , our recreations ?
God 'uds , I understand you not , but I know theRogue has hurt you .
Pursue thy own affairs : it will be illTo multiply bloud upon my head ; which thou wiltforce me to .
I know not your Rhetorick , but I can lay it onif you touch the woman. [ They fight .
Slave , take what thou deservest .
Heavens guard my Lord .
Oh do you breath ?
I hear the tread of people : I am hurt.The gods take part against me , could this BoorHave held me thus else ? I must shift for life , Though I do loath it. I would find a course , To lose it , rather by my will than force. [ Exit Phil .
I can not follow the Rogue. I pray thee wenchcome and kiss me now .
Phara. Dion , Cle. Thra. and Woodmen .
What art thou ?
Almost kil 'd I am for a foolish woman ; a knavehas hurt her .
The Princess Gentlemen ! Where 's the wound Madam ? Is it dangerous ?
He has not hurt me .
I'faith she lies , has hurt her in the breast , look else .
O sacred spring of innocent blood !
'T is above wonder ! who should dare this ?
I felt it not .
Speak villain , who has hurt the Princess ?
Is it the Princess ?
I .
Then I have seen something yet .
But who has hurt her ?
I told you a Rogue I ne 're saw him before , I .
Madam who did it ?
Some dishonest wretch , Alas I know him not , And do forgive him .
He 's hurt too , he can not go far , I made my Fathersold Fox flie about his ears .
How will you have me kill him ?
Not at all , 't is some distracted fellow .
By this hand , I'le leave ne'er a piece of him biggerthan a Nut , and bring him all in my Hat .
Nay , good Sir ; If you do take him , bring him quick to me , And I will study for a punishment , Great as his fault .
I will .
But swear .
By all my love I will : Woodmen conduct the Princessto the King , and bear that wounded fellow to dressing : Come Gentlemen , we'l follow the chase close. [ Ex. Are. Pha. Di. Cle. Thra. and 1 Woodman .

That you shall , and receive thanks. [ Exeunt .
If I get clear with this , I'le go see no more gay sights .
Bellario .
A heaviness near death sits on my brow , And I must sleep : Bear me thou gentle bank , For ever if thou wilt : you sweet ones all , Let me unworthy press you : I could wishI rather were a Coarse strewed o 're with you , Than quick above you. Dulness shuts mine eyes , And I am giddy ; Oh that I could takeSo sound a sleep , that I might never wake .
Philaster .
I have done ill , my conscience calls me false , To strike at her , that would not strike at me : When I did fight , me thought I heard her prayThe gods to guard me. She may be abus 'd , And I a loathed villain : if she be , She will conceal who hurt her ; He has wounds , And can not follow , neither knows he me.Who 's this ; Bellario sleeping ? If thou beestGuilty , there is no justice that thy sleep [ Cry within.Should be so sound , and mine , whom thou hast wrong 'd , So broken : Hark I am pursued : you godsI'le take this offer 'd means of my escape : They have no mark to know me , but my wounds , If she be true ; if false , let mischief lightOn all the world at once. Sword , print my woundsUpon this sleeping boy : I ha ' none I thinkAre mortal , nor would I lay greater on thee. [ Wounds him .
Oh death I hope is come , blest be that hand , It meant me well ; again , for pities sake .
I have caught my self , [ Phi. falls.The loss of bloud hath stayed my flight. Here , here , Is he that stroke thee : take thy full revenge , Use me , as I did mean thee , worse than death : I'le teach thee to revenge this luckless handWounded the Princess , tell my followersThou didst receive these hurts in staying me , And I will second thee : Get a reward .
Fly , fly my Lord and save your self .
How 's this ? Wouldst thou I should be safe ?
Else it were vainFor me to live. These little wounds I have , Ha ' not bled much , reach me that noble hand , I'le help to cover you .
Art thou true to me ?
Or let me perish loath'd. Come my good Lord , Creep in amongst those bushes : who does knowBut that the gods may save your ( much lov 'd ) breath ?
Then I shall die for grief , if not for this , That I have wounded thee : what wilt thou do ?
Shift for my self well : peace , I hear 'em come .
Follow , follow , follow ; that way they went .
With my own wounds I'le bloudy my own sword.I need not counterfeit to fall ; Heaven knows , That I can stand no longer .
Pha. Dion , Cle. and Thra .
To this place we have tract him by his bloud .
Yonder , my Lord , creeps one away .
Stay Sir , what are you ?
A wretched creature wounded in these WoodsBy Beasts ; relieve me , if your names be men , Or I shall perish .
This is he my Lord , Upon my soul that hurt her ; 't is the boy , That wicked boy that serv 'd her .
O thou damn 'd in thy creation ! What cause could'st thou shape to hurt the Princess ?
Then I am betrayed .
Betrayed ! no , apprehended .
I confess ; Urge it no more , that big with evil thoughtsI set upon her , and did take my aimHer death. For charity let fall at onceThe punishment you mean , and do not loadThis weary flesh with tortures .
I will know who hir 'd thee to this deed ?
Mine own revenge .
Revenge , for what ?
It pleas 'd her to receiveMe as her Page , and when my fortunes ebb 'd , That men strid o 're them carelesly , she did showrHer welcome graces on me , and did swellMy fortunes , till they overflow 'd their banks , Threatning the men that crost 'em ; when as swiftAs storms arise at sea , she turn 'd her eyesTo burning Suns upon me , and did dryThe streams she had bestowed , leaving me worseAnd more contemn 'd than other little brooks , Because I had been great : In short , I knewI could not live , and therefore did desireTo die reveng 'd .
If tortures can be found , Long as thy natural life , resolve to feelThe utmost rigour. [ Philaster creeps out of a bush .
Help to lead him hence .
Turn back you ravishers of Innocence , Know ye the price of that you bear away so rudely ?
Who 's that ?
'T is the Lord Philaster .
'T is not the treasure of all Kings in one , The wealth of Tagus , nor the Rocks of Pearl , That pave the Court of Neptune , can weigh downThat vertue. It was I that hurt the Princess.Place me , some god , upon a Piramis , Higher than hills of earth , and lend a voiceLoud as your Thunder to me , that from thence , I may discourse to all the under-world , The worth that dwells in him .
How 's this ?
My Lord , some manWeary of life , that would be glad to die .
Leave these untimely courtesies Bellario .
Alas he 's mad , come will you lead me on ?
By all the Oaths that men ought most to keep : And Gods do punish most , when men do break , He toucht her not. Take heed Bellario , How thou dost drown the vertues thou hast shownWith perjury. By all that 's good 't was I : You know she stood betwixt me and my right .
Thy own tongue be thy judge .
It was Philaster .
Is't not a brave boy ? Well Sirs , I fear we were all deceived .
Have I no friend here ?
Yes .
Then shew it ; Some good body lend a hand to draw us nearer.Would you have tears shed for you when you die ? Then lay me gentle on his neck that thereI may weep flouds , and breath out my spirit : 'T is not the wealth of Plutus , nor the goldLockt in the heart of earth , can buy awayThis arm-full from me , this had been a ransomTo have redeem 'd the great Augustus Caesar , Had he been taken : you hard-hearted men , More stony than these Mountains , can you seeSuch clear pure bloud drop , and not cut your fleshTo stop his life ? To bind whose better wounds , Queens ought to tear their hair , and with their tears , Bath 'em. Forgive me , thou that art the wealth ofpoor Philaster. [ Enter King , Arethusa and a Guard .
Is the villain ta'ne ?
Sir , here be two confess the deed ; but say it was
Question it no more , it was .
The fellow that did fight with him will tell us .
Ay me , I know he will .
Did not you know him ?
Sir , if it was he , he was disguised .
I was so. Oh my stars ! that I should live still .
Thou ambitious fool ; Thou that hast laid a train for thy own life ; Now I do mean to do , I'le leave to talk , bear himto prison .
Sir , they did plot together to take henceThis harmless life ; should it pass unreveng 'd , I should to earth go weeping : grant me then ( By all the love a Father bears his Child ) Their custodies , and that I may appointTheir tortures and their death .
Death ? soft , our Law will not reach that , for this fault .
'T is granted , take 'em to you , with a Guard.Come Princely Pharamond , this business past , We may with more security go on to your intended match .

Has the King sent for him to death ?
Yes , but the King must know , 't is not inhis power to war with Heaven .

Nay dear Philaster grieve not , we are well .
Nay good my Lord forbear , we are wondrous well .
Oh Arethusa ! O Bellario ! leave to be kind : I shall be shot from Heaven , as now fromEarth , If you continue so ; I am a man , False to a pair of the most trusty onesThat ever earth bore , can it bear us all ? Forgive and leave me , but the King hath sentTo call me to my death , Oh shew it me , And then forget me : And for thee my boy , I shall deliver words will mollifieThe hearts of beasts , to spare thy innocence .
Alas my Lord , my life is not a thingWorthy your noble thoughts ; 't is not a life , 'T is but a piece of child-hood thrown away : Should I out-live , I shall then out-liveVertue and honour. And when that day comes , If ever I should close these eyes but once , May I live spotted for my perjury , And waste my limbs to nothing .

A piece of you ? He was not born of women that can cut it and look on .
Take me in tears betwixt you , For my heart will break with shame and sorrow .
Why 't is well .

Blest be the time that I have leave to callSuch vertue mine ; now thou art in mine arms , Me thinks I have a salve unto my breastFor all the stings that dwell there , streams of griefThat I have wrought thee , and as much of joyThat I repent it , issue from mine eyes : Let them appease thee , take thy right ; take her , She is thy right too , and forget to urgeMy vexed soul with that I did before .
Sir , [ it is ] blotted from my memory , Past and forgotten : For you Prince of Spain , Whom I have thus redeem 'd , you have full leaveTo make an honourable voyage home.And if you would go furnish 'd to your RealmWith fair provision , I do see a LadyMe thinks would gladly bear you company : How like you this piece ?
Sir , he likes it well , For he hath tried it , and found it worthHis princely liking ; we were ta'ne a bed , I know your meaning , I am not the firstThat Nature taught to seek a fellow forth : Can shame remain perpetually in me , And not in others ? or have Princes salvesTo cure ill names that meaner people want ?
What mean you ?
You must get another shipTo clear the Princess and the boy together .
How now !
Others took me , and I took her and himAt that all women may be ta'ne sometimes : Ship us all four my Lord , we can endureWeather and wind alike .
Clear thou thy self , or know not me for Father .
This earth , How false it is ? what means is left for meTo clear my self ? It lies in your belief , My Lords believe me , and let all things elseStruggle together to dishonour me .
O stop your ears great King , that I may speakAs freedom would , then I will call this LadyAs base as be her actions , hear me Sir , Believe [ y ] our hated bloud when it rebelsAgainst your reason sooner than this Lady .
By this good light he bears it hansomely .
This Lady ? I will sooner trust the windWith Feathers , or the troubled Sea with Pearl , Than her with any thing ; believe her not ! Why think you , if I did believe her words ; I would outlive 'em : honour can not takeRevenge on you , then what were to be knownBut death ?
Forget her Sir , since all is knitBetween us : but I must request of youOne favour , and will sadly be denied .
Command what ere it be .
Swear to be true to what you promise .
By the powers above , Let it not be the death of her or him , And it is granted .
Bear away the boyTo Torture , I will have her clear 'd or buried .
O let me call my words back , worthy Sir , Ask something else , bury my life and rightIn one poor grave , but do not take away mylife and fame at once .
Away with him , it stands irrevocable .
Turn all your eyes on me , here stands a manThe falsest and the basest of this world : Set swords against this breast some honest man , For I have liv 'd till I am pitied , My former deeds are hateful , but this lastIs pitifull , for I unwillinglyHave given the dear preserver of my life [ Offers to kill himself. ] Unto his Torture : is it in the powerOf flesh and blood , to carry this and live ?
Dear Sir be patient yet , or stay that hand .
Sirs , strip that boy .
Come Sir , your tender flesh will try yourconstancie .
O kill me gentlemen .
No , help Sirs .
Will you Torture me ?
Hast there , why stay you ?
Then I shall not break my vow , You know just gods , though I discover all .
How 's that ? Will he confess ?
Sir , so he says .
Speak then .
Great King if you commandThis Lord to talk with me alone , my tongueUrg 'd by my heart , shall utter all the thoughtsMy youth hath known , and stranger things than theseYou hear not often .
Walk aside with him .
Why speak'st thou not ?
Know you this face my Lord ?
No .
Have you not seen it , nor the like ?
Yes , I have seen the like , but readilyI know not where .
I have been often toldIn Court , of one Euphrasia , a LadyAnd Daughter to you ; betwixt whom and me ( They that would flatter my bad face would swear ) There was such strange resemblance , that we twoCould not be known asunder , drest alike .
By Heaven and so there is .
For her fair sake , Who now doth spend the spring time of her lifeIn holy Pilgrimage , move to the King , That I may scape this Torture .
But thou speak'stAs like Euphrasia as thou dost look , How came it to thy knowledge that shelives in Pilgrimage ?
I know it not my Lord , But I have heard it , and do scarce believe it .
Oh my shame , is't possible ? Draw near , That I may gaze upon thee , art thou she ? Or else her Murderer ? where wert thou born ?
In Siracusa .
What 's thy name ?
O 't is just , 't is she now , I do know thee , Ohthat thou hadst diedAnd I had never seen thee nor my shame , How shall I own thee ? shall this tongue of mineE 're call thee Daughter more ?
Would I had died indeed , I wish it too , And so I must have done by vow , e 're publishedWhat I have told , but that there was no meansTo hide it longer , yet I joy in this , The Princess is all clear .
What have you done ?
All is discovered .
Why then hold you me ?
All is discovered , pray you let me go. [ He offers to stab himself . ]
Stay him .
What is discovered ?
Why my shame , it is a woman , let her speak the rest .
How ! that again .
It is a woman .
Blest be you powers that favour innocence .
Lay hold upon that Lady .
It is a woman Sir , hark Gentlemen ! It is a woman. Arethusa takeMy soul into thy breast , that would be goneWith joy : it is a woman , thou art fair , And vertuous still to ages , in despight of malice .
Speak you , where lies his shame ?
I am his Daughter .
The Gods are just .
I dare accuse none , but before you twoThe vertue of our age , I bend my kneeFor mercy .
Take it freely ; for I know , Though what thou didst were undiscreetly done , 'T was meant well .
And for me , I have a power to pardon sins as oftAs any man has power to wrong me .
Noble and worthy .
But Bellario , ( For I must call thee still so ) tell me whyThou didst conceal thy Sex , it was a fault , A fault Bellario , though thy other deedsOf truth outweigh 'd it : All these JealousiesHad flown to nothing , if thou hadst discovered , What now we know .
Search out a matchWithin our Kingdom where and when thou wilt , And I will pay thy Dowry , and thy selfWilt well deserve him .
Never Sir will IMarry , it is a thing within my vow , But if I may have leave to serve the Princess , To see the vertues of her Lord and her , I shall have hope to live .
I Philaster , Can not be jealous , though you had a LadyDrest like a Page to serve you , nor will ISuspect her living here : come live with me , Live free , as I do , she that loves my Lord , Curst be the wife that hates her .
I grieve such vertues should be laid in earthWithout an Heir ; hear me my Royal Father , Wrong not the freedom of our souls so much , To think to take revenge of that base woman , Her malice can not hurt us : set her freeAs she was born , saving from shame and sin .
Set her at liberty , but leave the Court , This is no place for such : you PharamondShall have free passage , and a conduct homeWorthy so great a Prince , when you come there , Remember 't was your faults that lost you her , And not my purpos 'd will .
I do confess , Renowned Sir .

'Courteous Reader. Philaster , and Anthusa his love , have laineso long a bleeding , by reason of some dangerous and gaping wounds , which they received in the first Impression , that it is wondered howthey could goe abroad so long , or travaile so farre as they havedone. Although they were hurt neither by me , nor the Printer ; yet Iknowing and finding by experience , how many well-wishers they haveabroad , have adventured to bind up their wounds , & to enable them tovisite upon better tearmes , such friends of theirs , as were pleasedto take knowledge of them , so mained [ ? maimed ] and deformed , asthey at the first were ; and if they were then gracious in yoursight , assuredly they will now finde double favour , being reformed , and set forth suteable , to their birth , and breeding .

Why do you grieve thus still ?
'Twould melt a Marble , And tame a Savage man , to feel my fortune .
What fortune ? I have liv 'd this thirty years , And run through all these follies you call fortunes , Yet never fixt on any good and constant , But what I made myself : why should I grieve thenAt that I may mould any way ?
You are wide still .
You love a Gentlewoman , a young handsom woman , I have lov 'd a thosand , not so few .
You are dispos 'd .
You hope to Marry her ; 't is a lawful callingAnd prettily esteem 'd of , but take heed then , Take heed dear Brother of a stranger fortuneThan e 're you felt yet ; fortune my foe is a friend to it .
'T is true I love , dearly , and truly love , A noble , vertuous , and most beauteous Maid , And am belov 'd again .
That 's too much o ' Conscience , To love all these would run me out o ' my wits .
Prethee give ear , I am to Marry her .
Dispatch it then , and I'le go call the Piper .
But O the wicked Custom of this Country , The barbarous , most inhumane , damned Custom .
'T is true , to marry is a CustomI ' the world ; for look you Brother , Wou 'd any man stand plucking for the Ace of Harts , With one pack of Cards all dayes on 's life ?
You do notOr else you purpose not to understand me .
Proceed , I will give ear .
They have a CustomIn this most beastly Country , out upo n't .
Let 's hear it first .
That when a Maid is contractedAnd ready for the tye o'th ' Church , the Governour , He that commands in chief , must have her Maiden-head , Or Ransom it for mony at his pleasure .
How might a man atchieve that place ? a rare Custom ! An admirable rare Custom : and none excepted ?
None , none .
The rarer still : how could I lay about me , In this rare Office ? are they born to it , or chosen ?
Both equal damnable .
Me thinks both excellent , Would I were the next heir .
To this mad fortuneAm I now come , my Marriage is proclaim 'd , And nothing can redeem me from this mischief .
She 's very young .
Yes .
And fair I dare proclaim her , Else mine eyes fail .
Fair as the bud unblasted .
I can not blame him then , if 'twere mine own case , I would not go an Ace less .
Fye Rutilio , Why do you make your brothers miseryYour sport and game ?
There is no pastime like it .
I look 'd for your advice , your timely Counsel , How to avoid this blow , not to be mockt at , And my afflictions jeer 'd .
I tell thee Arnoldo , An thou wert my Father , as thou art but my Brother , My younger Brother too , I must be merry.And where there is a wench yet can , a young wench , A handsome wench , and sooner a good turn too , An I were to be hang 'd , thus must I handle it.But you shall see Sir , I can change this habitTo do you any service ; advise what you please , And see with what Devotion I'le attend it ? But yet me thinks , I am taken with this Custom , [ Enter Charino and Zenocia.And could pretend to th ' place .
Draw off a little ; Here comes my Mistress and her Father .
A dainty wench ! Wou 'd I might farm his Custom .
My dear Daughter , Now to bethink your self of new adviceWill be too late , later this timeless sorrow , No price , nor prayers , can infringe the fateYour beauty hath cast on yo [ u ] , my best Zenocia , Be rul 'd by me , a Fathers care directs ye , Look on the Count , look chearfully and sweetly ; What though he have the power to possess ye , To pluck your Maiden honour , and then slight yeBy Custom unresistible to enjoy you ; Yet my sweet Child , so much your youth and goodness , The beauty of your soul , and Saint-like Modesty , Have won upon his mild mind , so much charm 'd him , That all power laid aside , what Law allows him , Or sudden fires , kindled from those bright eyes , He sues to be your servant , fairly , noblyFor ever to be tyed your faithful Husband : Consider my best child .
I have considered .
The blessedness that this breeds too , considerBesides your Fathers Honour , your own peace , The banishment for ever of this Custom , This base and barbarous use , for after onceHe has found the happiness of holy Marriage , And what it is to grow up with one Beauty , How he will scorn and kick at such an heritageLeft him by lust and lewd progenitors.All Virgins too , shall bless your name , shall Saint it , And like so many Pilgrims go to your shrine , When time has turn 'd your beauty into ashes , Fill 'd with your pious memory .
Good FatherHide not that bitter Pill I loath to swallowIn such sweet words .
The Count 's a handsome Gentleman , And having him , y'are certain of a fortune , A high and noble fortune to attend you : Where if you fling your Love upon this strangerThis young Arnoldo , not knowing from what placeOr honourable strain of blood he is sprung , you ventureAll your own sweets , and my long cares to nothing , Nor are you certain of his faith ; why may not thatWander as he does , every where ?
No more Sir ; I must not hear , I dare not hear him wrong 'd thus , Vertue is never wounded , but I suffer.'Tis an ill Office in your age , a poor one , To judge thus weakly : and believe your self too , A weaker , to betray your innocent Daughter , To his intemp'rate , rude , and wild embraces , She hates as Heaven hates falshood .
A good wench , She sticks close to you Sir .
His faith uncertain ? The nobleness his vertue springs from , doubted ? D 'ye doubt it is day now ? or when your body 's perfect , Your stomach 's well dispos 'd , your pulse 's temperate , D 'ye doubt you are in health ? I tell you Father , One hour of this mans goodness , this mans NoblenessPut in the Scale , against the Counts whole being , Forgive his lusts too , which are half his life , He could no more endure to hold weight with him ;
very looks , are fair examples ; His common and indifferent actions , Rules and strong ties of vertue : he has my first love , To him in sacred vow I have given this body , In him my mind inhabits .
Good wench still .
And till he fling me off , as undeserving , Which I confess I am , of such a blessing , But would be loth to find it so --
O never ; Never my happy Mistress , never , never , When your poor servant lives but in your favour , One foot i'th ' grave the other shall not linger.What sacrifice of thanks , what age of service , What danger , of more dreadful look than death , What willing Martyrdom to crown me constantMay merit such a goodness , such a sweetness ? A love so Nobly great , no power can ruine ; Most blessed Maid go on , the Gods that gave this , This pure unspotted love , the Child of Heaven , In their own goodness , must preserve and save it , And raise you a reward beyond our recompence .
I ask but you , a pure Maid to possess , And then they have crown 'd my wishes : If I fall thenGo seek some better love , mine will debase you .
A pretty innocent fool ; well , Governour , Though I think well of your custom , and could wish my selfFor this night in your place , heartily wish it : Yet if you play not fair play and above board too , I have a foolish gin here , I say no more ; I'le tell you what , and if your honours guts are not inchanted .
I should now chide you Sir , for so decliningThe goodness and the grace you have ever shew 'd me , And your own vertue too , in seeking rashlyTo violate that love Heaven has appointed , To wrest your Daughters thoughts , part that affectionThat both our hearts have tyed , and seek to give it .
To a wild fellow , that would weary her ; A Cannibal , that feeds on the heads of Maids , Then flings their bones and bodies to the Devil , Would any man of discretion venture such a gristle , To the rude clawes of such a Cat-a-mountain ? You had better tear her between two Oaks , a Town BullIs a meer Stoick to this fellow , a grave Philosopher , And a Spanish Jennet , a most vertuous Gentleman .
Does this seem handsome Sir ?
Though I confessAny man would desire to have her , and by any means , At any rate too , yet that this common Hangman , That hath whipt off the heads of a thousand maids already , That he should glean the Harvest , sticks in my stomach : This Rogue breaks young wenches to the Saddle , And teaches them to stumble ever after ; That he should have her ? for my Brother nowThat is a handsome young fellow ; and well thought on , And will deal tenderly in the business ; Or for my self that have a reputation , And have studied the conclusions of these causes , And know the perfect manage , I'le tell you old Sir , If I should call you wise Sir , I should bely you , This thing , you study to betray your child to , This Maiden-monger. When you have done your best , And think you have fixt her in the point of honour , Who do you think you have tyed her to ? a Surgeon , I must confess an excellent dissector , One that has cut up more young tender Lamb-pies --
What I spake Gentlemen , was meer compulsion , No Fathers free-will , nor did I touch your personWith any edge of spight ; or strain your lovesWith any base , or hir 'd perswasions ; Witness these tears , how well I wisht your fortunes. [ Exit .
There 's some grace in thee yet , you are determinedTo marry this Count , Lady .
Marry him Rutilio ?
Marry him , and lye with him I mean .
You can not mean that , If you be a true Gentleman , you dare not , The Brother to this man , and one that loves him ; I'le marry the Devil first .
A better choiceAnd lay his horns by , a handsomer bed-fellow , A cooler o ' my conscience .
Pray let me ask you ; And my dear Mistris , be not angry with meFor what I shall propound , I am confident , No promise , nor no power , can force your love , I mean in way of marriage , never stir you , Nor to forget my faith , no state can wound you.But for this Custom , which this wretched countryHath wrought into a law , and must be satisfied ; Where all the pleas of honour are but laught at , And modesty regarded as a may-game , What shall be here considered ? power we have none , To make resistance , nor policie to cross it : 'T is held Religion too , to pay this duty .
I'le dye an Atheist then .
My noblest Mistris , Not that I wish it so , but say it were so , Say you did render up part of your honour , For whilst your will is clear , all can not perish ; Say for one night you entertain 'd this monster , Should I esteem you worse , forc 'd to this render ? Your mind I know is pure , and full as beauteous ; After this short eclipse , you would rise again , And shaking off that cloud , spread all your lustre .
Who made you witty , to undoe your self , Sir ? Or are you loaden , with the love I bring you , And fain would fling that burthen on another ? Am I grown common in your eyes Arnoldo ? Old , or unworthy of your fellowship ? D 'ye think because a woman , I must err , And therefore rather wish that fall before-handColoured with Custom , not to be resisted ? D 'ye love as painters doe , only some pieces , Some certain handsome touches of your Mistris , And let the mind pass by you , unexamined ? Be not abus 'd ; with what the maiden vesselIs seasoned first , you understand the proverb .
I am afraid , this thing will make me vertuous .
Should you lay by the least part of that loveY'ave sworn is mine , your youth and faith has given me , To entertain another , nay a fairer , And make the case thus desp'rate , she must dy else ; D 'ye think I would give way , or count this honest ? Be not deceiv 'd , these eyes should never see you more , This tongue forget to name you , and this heartHate you , as if you were born , my full Antipathie .
and more imperious love , aloneRule , and admit no rivals : the purest springsWhen they are courted by lascivious land-floods , Their maiden pureness , and their coolness perish.And though they purge again to their first beauty , The sweetness of their taste is clean departed.I must have all or none ; and am not worthyLonger the noble name of wife , Arnoldo , Than I can bring a whole heart pure and handsom .
I never shall deserve you : not to thank you ; You are so heavenly good , no man can reach you : I am sorrie I spake so rashly , 't was but to try you .
You might have tryed a thousand women so , And 900 , fourscore and 19 should ha ' followed your counsel.Take heed o ' clapping spurrs to such free cattell .
We must bethink us suddenly and constantly , And wisely too , we expect no common danger .
Be most assur 'd , I'le dye first .
Clodio , and Guard .
A n't come to that once , The Devil pick his bones , that dyes a coward , I'le jog along with you , here comes the Stallion , How smug he looks upon the imaginationOf what he hopes to act ! pox on your kidneys ; How they begin to melt ! how big he bears , Sure he will leap before us all : what a sweet companyOf rogues and panders wait upon his lewdness ! Plague of your chops , you ha ' more handsome bitts , Than a hundred honester men , and more deserving.How the dogg leers .
You need not now be jealous , I speak at distance to your wife , but when the Priest has done , We shall grow nearer , and more familiar .
I'le watch you for that trick , baboon , I'leSmoke you : the rogue sweats , as if he had eatenGrains , he broyles , if I do come to theBasting of you .
Your LordshipMay happily speak this , to fright a stranger , But 't is not in your honour , to perform it ; The Custom of this place , if such there be , At best most damnable , may urge you to it , But if you be an honest man you hate it , How ever I will presently prepareTo make her mine , and most undoubtedlyBelieve you are abus 'd , this custome feign 'd too , And what you now pretend , most fair and vertuous .
Go and believe , a good belief does well Sir ; And you Sir , clear the place , but leave her here .
Your Lordships pleasure .
That anon Arnoldo , This is but talk .
Shall we goe off ?
By any means , I know she has pious thoughts enough to guard her : Besides , here 's nothing due to him till the tye be done , Nor dare he offer .
Now do I long to worry him : Pray have a care to the main chance .
Pray Sir , fear not. [ Exit Ar. and Rut .
Now , what say you to me ?
Sir it becomesThe modestie , that maids are ever born with , To use few words .
Do you see nothing in me ? Nothing to catch your eyes , nothing of wonderThe common mould of men , come short , and want in ? Do you read no future fortune for your self here ? And what a happiness it may be to you , To have him honour you , all women aim at ? To have him love you Lady , that man love you , The best , and the most beauteous have run mad for ? Look and be wise , you have a favour offer 'd youI do not every day propound to women ; You are a prettie one ; and though each hourI am glutted with the sacrifice of beautie , I may be brought , as you may handle it , To cast so good a grace and liking on you.You understand , come kiss me , and be joyfull , I give you leave .
Faith Sir , 'twill not shew handsome ; Our sex is blushing , full of fear , unskil 'd tooIn these alarms .
Learn then and be perfect .
I do beseech your honour pardon me , And take some skilfull one can hold you play , I am a fool .
I tell thee maid I love thee , Let that word make thee happie , so far love thee , That though I may enjoy thee without ceremony , I will descend so low , to marry thee , Me thinks I see the race that shall spring from us , Some Princes , some great Souldiers .
I am afraidYour honour 's couzen 'd in this calculation ; For certain , I shall ne 're have a child by you .
Why ?
Because I must not think to marry you , I dare not Sir , the step betwixt your honour , And my poor humble State .
I will descend to thee , And buoy thee up .
I'le sink to th ' Center first.Why would your Lordship marry , and confine that pleasureYou ever have had freely cast upon you ? Take heed my Lord , this marrying is a mad matter , Lighter a pair of shackles will hang on you , And quieter a quartane feaver find you.If you wed me I must enjoy you only , Your eyes must be called home , your thoughts in cages , To sing to no ears then but mine ; your heart bound , The custom , that your youth was ever nurst in , Must be forgot , I shall forget my duty else , And how that will appear --
Wee'l talk of that more .
Besides I tell ye , I am naturally , As all young women are , that shew like handsome , Exceeding proud , being commended , monstrous.Of an unquiet temper , seldom pleas 'd , Unless it be with infinite observance , Which you were never bred to ; once well angred , As every cross in us , provokes that passion , And like a Sea , I roule , toss , and chafe a week after.And then all mischief I can think upon , Abusing of your bed the least and poorest , I tell you what you'le finde , and in these fitts , This little beauty you are pleased to honour , Will be so chang 'd , so alter 'd to an ugliness , To such a vizard , ten to one , I dye too , Take't then upon my death you murder 'd me .
Away , away fool , why dost thou proclame theseTo prevent that in me , thou hast chosen in another ?
Him I have chosen , I can rule and master , Temper to what I please , you are a great oneOf a strong will to bend , I dare not venture.Be wise my Lord , and say you were well counsel 'd , Take mony for my ransom , and forget me , 'Twill be both safe , and noble for your honour , And wheresoever my fortunes shall conduct me , So worthy mentions I shall render of you , So vertuous and so fair .
You will not marrie me ?
I do beseech your honour , be not angryAt what I say , I can not love ye , dare not ; But set a ransom , for the flowr you covet .
No mony , nor no prayers , shall redeem that , Not all the art you have .
Set your own price Sir .
Goe to your wedding , never kneel to me , When that 's done , you are mine , I will enjoy you : Your tears do nothing , I will not lose my customTo cast upon my self an Empires fortune .

I beseech your LordshipLoad not a Fathers love .
Pledge it Charino , Or by my life I'le make thee pledge thy last , And be sure she be a maid , a perfect Virgin , ( I will not have my expectation dull 'd ) Or your old pate goes off. I am hot and fiery , And my bloud beats alarms through my body , And fancie high. You of my guard retire , And let me hear no noise about the lodgingBut musick and sweet ayres , now fetch your Daughter , And bid the coy wench put on all her beauties , All her enticements , out-blush damask Roses , And dim the breaking East with her bright Crystals.I am all on fire , away .

Manuel du Sosa , and Guiomar .
I Hear and see too much of him , and thatCompels me Madam , though unwillingly , To wish I had no Uncles part in him , And much I fear , the comfort of a SonYou will not long enjoy .
'T is not my fault , And therefore from his guilt my innocenceCannot be tainted , since his Fathers death , ( Peace to his soul ) a Mothers prayers and careWere never wanting , in his education.His Child-hood I pass o 're , as being brought upUnder my wing ; and growing ripe for study , I overcame the tenderness , and joyI had to look upon him , and providedThe choicest Masters , and of greatest nameOf Salamanca , in all liberal Arts .
To train his youth up.I must witness that .
How there he prospered to the admirationOf all that knew him , for a general Scholar , Being one of note , before he was a man , Is still remembred in that Academy , From thence I sent him to the Emperours Court , Attended like his Fathers Son , and thereMaintain 'd him , in such bravery and height , As did become a Courtier .
'T was that spoil 'd him , my Nephew had been happy.The Court 's a School indeed , in which some fewLearn vertuous principles , but most forgetWhat ever they brought thither good and honest.Trifling is there in practice , serious actionsAre obsolete and out of use , my NephewHad been a happy man , had he ne 're knownWhat 's there in grace and fashion .
I have heard yet , That while he liv 'd in Court , the EmperourTook notice of his carriage and good parts , The Grandees did not scorn his company , And of the greatest Ladies he was heldA compleat Gentleman .
He indeed Daunc 'd well ; A turn o'th ' Toe , with a lofty trick or two , To argue nimbleness , and a strong back , Will go far with a Madam : 't is most true , That he 's an excellent Scholar , and he knows it ; An exact Courtier , and he knows that too ; He has fought thrice , and come off still with honour , Which he forgets not .
Nor have I much reason , To grieve his fortune that way .
You are mistaken , Prosperity does search a Gentlemans temper , More than his adverse fortune : I have knownMany , and of rare parts from their successIn private Duels , rais 'd up to such a pride , And so transform 'd from what they were , that allThat lov 'd them truly , wish 'd they had fallen in them.I need not write examples , in your Son'Tis too apparent ; for e 're Don DuarteMade tryal of his valour , he indeed wasAdmired for civil courtesie , but nowHe 's swoln so high , out of his own assurance , Of what he dares do , that he seeks occasions , Unjust occasions , grounded on blind passion , Ever to be in quarrels , and this makes himShunn 'd of all fair Societies .
Would it wereIn my weak power to help it : I will useWith my entreaties th ' Authority of a Mother , As you may of an Uncle , and enlarge itWith your command , as being a GovernourTo the great King in Lisbon.Enter Duarte and his Page .
Here he comes.We are unseen , observe him .
Boy .
My Lord .
What saith the Spanish Captain that I struck , To my bold challenge ?
He refus 'd to read it .
Why didst not leave it there ?
I did my Lord , But to no purpose , for he seems more willingTo sit down with the wrongs , than to repairHis honour by the sword ; he knows too well , That from your Lordship nothing can be gotBut more blows , and disgraces .
He 's a wretch , A miserable wretch , and all my furyIs lost upon him ; holds the Mask , appointedI'th ' honour of Hippolyta ?
'T is broke off .
The reason ?
This was one , they heard your LordshipWas by the Ladies choice to lead the Dance , And therefore they , too well assur 'd how farYou would outshine 'em , gave it o 're and said , They would not serve for foiles to set you off .
They at their best are such , and ever shall beWhere I appear .
Do you note his modesty ?
But was there nothing else pretended ?
Yes , Young Don Alonzo , the great Captains Nephew , Stood on comparisons .
With whom ?
With you , And openly profess 'd that all precedence , His birth and state consider 'd , was due to him , Nor were your Lordship to contend with oneSo far above you .
I look down upon himWith such contempt and scorn , as on my slave , He 's a name only , and all good in himHe must derive from his great grandsires Ashes , For had not their victorious acts bequeath'dHis titles to him , and wrote on his forehead , This is a Lord , he had liv 'd unobserv'dBy any man of mark , and died as oneAmongst the common route. Compare with me ? 'T is Gyant-like ambition ; I know him , And know my self , that man is truly noble , And he may justly call that worth his own , Which his deserts have purchas 'd , I could wishMy birth were more obscure , my friends and kinsmenOf lesser power , or that my provident FatherHad been like to that riotous EmperourThat chose his belly for his only heir ; For being of no family then , and poorMy vertues wheresoe'r I liv 'd , should makeThat kingdom my inheritance .
Strange self Love !
For if I studied the Countries Laws , I should so easily sound all their depth , And rise up such a wonder , that the pleaders , That now are in most practice and esteem , Should starve for want of Clients : if I travell 'd , Like wise Ulysses to see men and manners , I would return in act , more knowing , than
could fancy him ; if a Physician , So oft I would restore death-wounded men , That where I liv 'd , Galen should not be nam 'd , And he that joyn 'd again the scatter 'd limbsOf torn Hippolytus should be forgotten.I could teach Ovid courtship , how to winA Julia , and enjoy her , though her DowerWere all the Sun gives light to : and for armsWere the Persian host that drank up Rivers , addedTo the Turks present powers , I could direct , Command , and Marshal them .
And yet you know notTo rule your self , you would not to a boy elseLike Plautus Braggart boast thus .
All I speak , In act I can make good .
Why then being MasterOf such and so good parts do you destroy them , With self opinion , or like a rich miser , Hoard up the treasures you possess , impartingNor to your self nor others , the use of them ? They are to you but like inchanted viands , On which you seem to feed , yet pine with hunger ; And those so rare perfections in my SonWhich would make others happy , render meA wretched Mother .
You are too insolent.And those too many excellencies , that feedYour pride , turn to a Pleurisie , and killThat which should nourish vertue ; dare you thinkAll blessings are confer 'd on you alone ? Y'are grosly cousen 'd ; there 's no good in you , Which others have not : are you a Scholar ? soAre many , and as knowing : are you valiant ? Waste not that courage then in braules , but spend itIn the Wars , in service of your King and Country .
Yes , so I might be General , no man livesThat 's worthy to command me .
Sir , in LisbonI am : and you shall know it ; every hourI am troubled with complaints of your behaviourFrom men of all conditions , and all sexes.And my authority , which you presumeWill bear you out , in that you are my Nephew , No longer shall protect you , for I vowThough all that 's past I pardon , I will punishThe next fault with as much severityAs if you were a stranger , rest assur 'd o n't .
And by that love you should bear , or that dutyYou owe a Mother , once more I command youTo cast this haughtiness off ; which if you do , All that is mine , is yours , if not , expectMy prayers , and vows , for your conversion only , But never means nor favour. [ Ex. Manuel and Guiomar .
I am Tutor'dAs if I were a child still , the base PeasantsThat fear , and envy my great worth , have done this ; But I will find them out , I will o'boordGet my disguise ; I have too long been idle , Nor will I curb my spirit , I was born free , And will pursue the course best liketh me. [ Exeunt .
Leopold , Sailers , and Zenocia .
Divide the spoil amongst you , this fair CaptiveI only challenge for my self .
You have won herAnd well deserve her : twenty years I have liv'dA Burgess of the Sea , and have been presentAt many a desperate fight , but never sawSo small a Bark with such incredible valourSo long defended , and against such odds , And by two men scarce arm 'd too .
'T was a wonder.And yet the courage they exprest being taken , And their contempt of death wan more upon meThan all they did , when they were free : me thinksI see them yet when they were brought aboard us , Disarm 'd and ready to be put in fettersHow on the suddain , as if they had swornNever to taste the bread of servitude , Both snatching up their swords , and from this Virgin , Taking a farewel only with their eyes , They leapt into the Sea .
Indeed 't was rare .
It wrought so much on me , that but I fear'dThe great ship that pursued us , our own safetyHindring my charitable purpose to 'em , I would have took 'em up , and with their livesThey should have had their liberties .
O too late , For they are lost , for ever lost .
Take comfort'Tis not impossible , but that they live yet , For when they left the ships , they were withinA League o'th ' shore , and with such strength and cunningThey swimming , did delude the rising Billows , With one hand making way , and with the other , Their bloudy swords advanced , threatning the Sea-godsWith war , unless they brought them safely off , That I am almost confident they live , And you again may see them .
In that hopeI brook a wretched being , till I amMade certain of their fortunes ; but they dead , Death hath so many doors to let out life , I will not long survive them .
Hope the best , And let the courteous usage you have found , Not usual in men of War perswade youTo tell me your condition .
You know it , A Captive , my fate and your power have made me , Such I am now , but what I was it skills not : For they being dead , in whom I only live , I dare not challenge Family , or Country , And therefore Sir enquire not , let it suffice , I am your servant , and a thankful servant ( If you will call that so , which is but duty ) I ever will be , and my honour safe , Which nobly hitherto ye have preserv 'd , No slavery can appear in such a form , Which with a masculine constancy I will notBoldly look on and suffer .
You mistake me : That you are made my prisoner , may proveThe birth of your good fortune. I do findA winning language in your tongue and looks ; Nor can a suit by you mov 'd be deni 'd , And therefore of a prisoner you must beThe Victors advocate .
To whom ?
A Lady : In whom all graces that can perfect beautyAre friendly met. I grant that you are fair : And had I not seen her before , perhapsI might have sought to you .
This I hear gladly .
To this incomparable Lady I will give you , ( Yet being mine , you are already hers ) And to serve her is more than to be free , At least I think so ; and when you live with her , If you will please to think on him that brought youTo such a happiness , for so her bountyWill make you think her service , you shall everMake me at your devotion .
All I can do , Rest you assur 'd of .
At night I'le present you , Till when I am your Guard .
Ever your servant. [ Exeunt .
Arnoldo and Rutilio .
To what are we reserv 'd ?
Troth 't is uncertain , Drowning we have scap 'd miraculously , andStand fair for ought I know for hanging ; monyWe have none , nor e 're are like to have , 'T is to be doubted : besides we are strangers , Wondrous hungry strangers ; and charityGrowing cold , and miracles ceasing , Without a Conjurers help , can not findWhen we shall eat again .
These are no wantsIf put in ballance with Zenocias loss ; In that alone all miseries are spoken : O my Rutilio , when I think on her , And that which she may suffer , being a Captive , Then I could curse my self , almost those powersThat send me from the fury of the Ocean .
You have lost a wife indeed , a fair and chast one , Two blessings , not found often in one woman ; But she may be recovered , questionlessThe ship that took us was of Portugal , And here in Lisbon , by some means or otherWe may hear of her .
In that hope I live .
And so do I , but hope is a poor SalladTo dine and sup with , after a two dayes fast too , Have you no mony left ?
Not a Denier .
Nor any thing to pawn ? 't is now in fashion , Having a Mistress , sure you should not beWithout a neat Historical shirt .

Innocence is bold : Nor can I fear .
That you are poor and strangers , I easily perceive .
But that you'l help us , Or any of your tribe , we dare not hope Sir .
Why think you so ?
Because you are a Jew Sir , And courtesies come sooner from the DevilThan any of your Nation .
We are men , And have like you , compassion when we findFit subjects for our bounty , and for proofThat we dare give , and freely , not to you Sir , Pray spare your pains , there 's gold , stand not amaz 'd , 'T is current I assure you .
Take it man , Sure thy good Angel is a Jew , and comesIn his own shape to help thee : I could wish nowMine would appear too like a Turk .
I thank you , But yet must tell you , if this be the PrologueTo any bad act , you would have me practise , I must not take it .
This is but the earnestOf [ t ] hat which is to follow , and the bondWhich you must seal to for't , is your advancement , Fortune with all that 's in her power to give , Offers her self up to you : entertain her , And that which Princes have kneel 'd for in vainPresents it self to you .
'T is above wonder .
But far beneath the truth , in my relationOf what you shall possess , if you emb [ r ] ace it.There is an hour in each mans life appointedTo make his happiness if then he seize it , And this , ( in which , beyond all expectation , You are invited to your good ) is yours , If you dare follow me , so , if not , hereafterExpect not the like offer.

By this light I 'm glad I have it : There are few Gallants , ( for men may be suchAnd yet want gold , yea and sometimes silver ) But would receive such favours from the Devil , Though he appear 'd like a Broker , and demandedSixty i'th ' hundred .

'T is Don Duarte .
Pride has got a fall , He was still in quarrels , scorn 'd us Peace-makers , And all our Bill-authority , now h'as paid for't.You ha ' met with your match Sir now , bring off his bodyAnd bear it to the Governour. Some pursueThe murderer ; yet if he scape , it skills not ; Were I a Prince , I would reward him for't , He has rid the City of a turbulent beast , There 's few will pity him : but for his MotherI truly grieve indeed , she 's a good Lady.

He 's not i'th ' house ?
Haste and seek him , Go all and every where , Pie not to bedTill you return him , take away the lights too , The Moon lends me too much , to find my fearsAnd those devotions I am to payAre written in my heart , not in this book , [ Kneel.And I shall read them there without a Taper. [ Ex. Ser .
Rutilio .
I am pursued ; all the Ports are stopt too ; Not any hope to escape , behind , before me , On either side I am beset , cursed fortuneMy enemie on the Sea , and on the Land too , Redeem 'd from one affliction to another : Would I had made the greedy waves my tombAnd dyed obscure , and innocent , not as NeroSmear 'd o 're with blood. Whither have my fears brought me ? I am got into a house , the doors all open , This , by the largeness of the room , the hangings , And other rich adornments , glistring throughThe sable masque of night , sayes it belongsTo one of means and rank : no servant stirring ? Murmur nor whisper ?
Who 's that ?
By the voice , This is a woman .
Stephana , Jaspe , Julia , Who waits there ?
'T is the Lady of the house , I'le flie to her protection .
Speak , what are you ?
Of all that ever breath 'd , a man most wretched .
I am sure you are a man of most ill manners , You could not with so little reverence elsePress to my private chamber. Whither would you , Or what do you seek for ?
Gracious woman hear me ; I am a stranger , and in that I answerAll your demands , a most unfortunate stranger , That call 'd unto it by my enemies pride , Have left him dead i'th ' streets , Justice pursues me , And for that life I took unwillingly , And in a fair defence , I must lose mine , Unless you in your charity protect me.Your house is now my sanctuary , and the Altar , I gladly would take hold of your sweet mercy.By all that 's dear unto you , by your vertues , And by your innocence , that needs no forgiveness , Take pity on me .
Are you a Castillian ?
No Madam , Italy claims my birth .
I ask notWith purpose to betray you , if you wereTen thousand times a Spaniard , the nationWe Portugals most hate , I yet would save youIf it lay in my power : lift up these hangings ; Behind my Beds head there 's a hollow place , Into which enter ; so , but from this stir notIf the Officers come , as you expect they will doe , I know they owe such reverence to my lodgings , That they will easily give credit to meAnd search no further .
The blest Saints pay for meThe infinite debt I owe you .
How he quakes ! Thus far I feel his heart beat , be of comfort , Once more I give my promise for your safety , All men are subject to such accidents , Especially the valiant ; and who knows not , But that the charity I afford this strangerMy only Son else where may stand in need of ?
Now Madam , if your wisedom ever couldRaise up defences against floods of sorrowThat haste to overwhelm you , make true use ofYour great discretion .
Your only sonMy Lord Duart 's slain .
His murtherer , pursued by usWas by a boy discoveredEntring your house , and that induced usTo press into it for his apprehension .
Oh !
Sure her heart is broke .
Madam .
Stand off.My sorrow is so dear and pretious to me , That you must not partake it , suffer itLike wounds that do breed inward to dispatch me.O my Duart , such an end as thisThy pride long since did prophesie ; thou art dead , And to encrease my misery , thy sad MotherMust make a wilfull shipwrack of her vowOr thou fall unreveng'd. My Soul 's divided , And piety to a son , and true performanceOf hospitable duties to my guest , That are to others Angels , are my furies.Vengeance knocks at my heart , but my word givenDenies the entrance , is no Medium left , But that I must protect the murderer , Or suffer in that faith he made his altar ? Motherly love give place , the fault made this way , To keep a vow , to which high Heaven is witness , Heaven may be pleas 'd to pardon .
Manuel , Doctors , Surgeons .
'T is too late , Hee 's gone , past all recovery : now reproofWere but unseasonable when I should give comfort , And yet remember Sister .
O forbear , Search for the murtherer , and remove the body , And as you think fit , give it burial.Wretch that I am , uncapable of all comfort , And therefore I intreat my friends and kinsfolk , And you my Lord , for some space to forbearYour courteous visitations .
We obey you. [ Exeunt omnes with the body.Manet Guiomar .
My Spirits come back , and now despair resignsHer place again to hope .
What ere thou artTo whom I have given means of life , to witnessWith what Religion I have kept my promise , Come fearless forth , but let thy face be cover 'd , That I hereafter be not forc't to know thee , For motherly affection may returnMy vow once paid to heaven. Thou hast taken from meThe respiration of my heart , the lightOf my swoln eyes , in his life that sustain 'd me : Yet my word given to save you , I make good , Because what you did , was not done with malice , You are not known , there is no mark about youThat can discover you ; let not fear betray you.With all convenient speed you can , flie from meThat I may never see you ; and that wantOf means may be no let unto your journie , There are a hundred Crownes : you are at the door now , And so Farewell for ever .
Let me first fallBefore your feet , and on them pay the dutyI owe your goodness ; next all blessings to you , And Heaven restore the joyes I have bereft you , With full increase hereafter , living beThe Goddess stil 'd of Hospitalitie .
Fling off these sullen clouds , you are enter 'd nowInto a house of joy and happiness , I have prepar 'd a blessing for ye .
Thank ye , my state would rather ask a curse .
You are peevishAnd know not when ye are friended , I have us 'd those means , The Lady of this house , the noble Lady , Will take ye as her own , and use ye graciously : Make much of what you are , Mistris of that beautie , And expose it not to such betraying sorrows , When ye are old , and all those sweets hang wither'd,
Servant.Then sit and sigh .
My Autumn is not far off .
Have you told your Lady ?
Yes Sir , I have told herBoth of your noble service , and your present , Which she accepts .
I should be blest to see her .
That now you can not doe : she keeps the ChamberNot well dispos 'd ; and has denied all visits , The maid I have in charge to receive from ye , So please you render her .
With all my service , But fain I would have seen .
'T is but your patience ; No doubt she can not but remember nobly .
These three years I have lov 'd this scornfull Lady , And follow 'd her with all the truth of service , In all which time , but twice she has honour 'd meWith sight of her blest beauty : when you please Sir , You may receive your charge , and tell your Lady ; A Gentleman whose life is only dedicatedTo her commands , kisses her beauteous hands ; And Faire-one , now your help , you may rememberThe honest courtesies , since you are mine , I ever did your modestie : you shall be near her , And if sometimes you name my service to her , And tell her with what nobleness I love her , 'Twill be a gratitude I shall remember .
What in my poor power lyes , so it be honest .
I ask no more .
You must along with me ( Fair . )
And so I leave you two : but a fortuneToo happy for my fate : you shall enjoy her .
Be quick , be quick , out with the banquet there , These scents are dull ; cast richer on , and fuller ; Scent every place , where have you plac 'd the musick ?
Here they stand ready Sir .
'T is well , be sureThe wines be lusty , high , and full of Spirit , And Amber 'd all .
They are .
Give fair attendance.In the best trim , and state , make ready all.I shall come presently again. [ Banquet set forth. Exit .
We shall Sir , What preparation 's this ? Some new deviceMy Lady has in hand .
O , prosper itAs long as it carries good wine in the mouth , And good meat with it , where are all the rest ?
They are ready to attend. [ Musick .
Sure some great person , They would not make this hurry else .
Hark the Musick .
Zabulon , and Arnoldo.It will appear now certain , here it comes.Now to our places .
Whither will he lead me ? What invitation 's this ? to what new endAre these fair preparations ? a rich Banquet , Musick , and every place stuck with adornment , Fit for a Princes welcome ; what new gameHas Fortune now prepar 'd to shew me happy ? And then again to sink me ? 't is no illusion , Mine eyes are not deceiv 'd , all these are reall ; What wealth and state !
Will you sit down and eat Sir ? These carry little wonder , they are usual ; But you shall see , if you be wise to observe it , That that will strike dead , strike with amazement , Then if you be a man : this fair health to you .
What shall I see ? I pledge ye Sir , I was neverSo buried in amazement --
You are so still : Drink freely .
The very wines are admirable : Good Sir , give me leave to ask this question , For what great worthy man are these prepar 'd ? And why do you bring me hither ?
They are for you , Sir ; And under-value not the worth you carry , You are that worthy man : think well of these , They shall be more , and greater .
Well , blind fortuneThou hast the prettiest changes when thou art pleas 'd , To play thy game out wantonly --
Come be lusty , And awake your Spirits. [ Cease Musick .
Good Sir , do not wake me.For willingly I would dye in this dream , pray whose ServantsAre all these that attend here ?
They are yours ; They wait on you .
I never yet rememberI kept such faces , nor that I was ever ableTo maintain so many .
Now you are , and shall be .
You'l say this house is mine too ?
Say it ? swear it .
And all this wealth ?
This is the least you see Sir .
Why , where has this been hid these thirtie years ? For certainly I never found I was wealthieTill this hour , never dream 'd of house , and Servants.I had thought I had been a younger Brother , a poor Gent.I may eat boldly then .
'T is prepar 'd for ye .
The taste is perfect , and most delicate : But why for me ? give me some wine , I do drink ; I feel it sensibly , and I am here , Here in this glorious place : I am bravely us 'd too , Good Gentle Sir , give me leave to think a little , For either I am much abus 'd --
Strike MusickAnd sing that lusty Song. [ Musick. Song .
Bewitching harmony ! Sure I am turn 'd into another Creature .
Hippolyta.Happy and blest , Arnoldo was unfortunate ; Ha ! bless mine eyes ; what pretious piece of natureTo pose the world ?
I told you , you would see thatWould darken these poor preparations ; What think ye now ? nay rise not , 't is no vision .
'T is more : 't is miracle .
You are welcom Sir .
It speaks , and entertains me still more glorious ; She is warm , and this is flesh here : how she stirs me ! Bless me what stars are there ?
May I sit near ye ?
No , you are too pure an object to behold , Too excellent to look upon , and live ; I must remove .
She is a woman Sir , Fy , what faint heart is this ?
The house of wonder .
Do not you think your self now truly happy ? You have the abstract of all sweetness by ye , The precious wealth youth labours to arrive at ; Nor is she less in honour , than in beauty,
Royal Duke is proud to call herHis best , his Noblest , and most happy Sister , Fortune has made her Mistress of herself , Wealthy , and wise , without a power to sway her , Wonder of Italy , of all hearts Mistress .
And all this is --
Hippolyta the beauteous .
You are a poor relator of my fortunes , Too weak a Chronicle to speak my blessings , And leave out that essential part of storyI am most high and happy in , most fortunate , The acquaintance , and the noble fellowshipOf this fair Gentleman : pray ye do not wonder , Nor hold it strange to hear a handsome LadySpeak freely to ye : with your fair leave and courtesieI will sit by ye .
I know not what to answer , Nor where I am , nor to what end consider ; Why do you use me thus ?
Are ye angry Sir , Because ye are entertain 'd with all humanity ? Freely and nobly us 'd ?
No gentle Lady , That were uncivil , but it much amazes meA stranger , and a man of no desertShould find such floods of courtesie .
I love ye , I honour ye , the first and best of all men , And where that fair opinion leads , 't is usualThese trifles that but serve to set off , follow.I would not have you proud now , nor disdainfulBecause I say I love ye , though I swear it , Nor think it a stale favour I fling on ye , Though ye be handsome , and the only manI must confess I ever fixt mine eye on , And bring along all promises that please us , Yet I should hate ye then , despise ye , scorn ye , And with as much contempt pursue your person , As now I do with love. But you are wiser , At least I think , more master of your fortune , And so I drink your health .
Hold fast good honesty , I am a lost man else .
Now you may kiss me , 'T is the first kiss , I ever askt , I swear to ye .
That I dare do sweet Lady .
You do it well too ; You are a Master Sir , that makes you coy .
Would you would send your people off .
Well thought on.Wait all without. [ Exit Zab. and Servants .
I hope she is pleas 'd throughly .
Why stand ye still ? here 's no man to detect ye , My people are gone off : come , come , leave conjuring , The Spirit you would raise , is here already , Look boldly on me .
What would you have me do ?
O most unmanly question ! have you do ? Is't possible your years should want a Tutor ? I'le teach ye : come , embrace me .
Fye stand off ; And give me leave , more now than e 're , to wonder , A building of so goodly a proportion , Outwardly all exact , the frame of Heaven , Should hide within so base inhabitants ? You are as fair , as if the morning bare ye , Imagination never made a sweeter ; Can it be possible this frame should suffer , And built on slight affections , fright the viewer ? Be excellent in all , as you are outward , The worthy Mistress of those many blessingsHeaven has bestowed , make 'em appear still nobler , Because they are trusted to a weaker keeper.Would ye have me love ye ?
Yes .
Not for your beauty ; Though I confess , it blowes the first fire in us , Time as he passes by , puts out that sparkle ; Nor for your wealth , although the world kneel to it , And make it all addition to a woman , Fortune that ruines all , makes that his conquest ; Be honest , and be vertuous , I'le admire ye , At least be wise , and where ye lay these nets , Strow over 'em a little modesty , 'Twill well become your cause , and catch more Fools .
Could any one that lov 'd this wholesome counselBut love the giver more ? you make me fonder : You have a vertuous mind , I want that ornament ; Is it a sin I covet to enjoy ye ? If ye imagine I am too free a Lover , And act that part belongs to you , I am silent : Mine eyes shall speak my blushes , parly with ye ; I will not touch your hand , but with a trembleFitting a Vestal Nun ; not long to kiss ye , But gently as the Air , and undiscern 'd too , I'le steal it thus : I'le walk your shadow by ye , So still and silent that it shall be equal , To put me off , as that , and when I covet , To give such toyes as these --
A new temptation --
Thus like the lazie minutes will I drop 'em , Which past once are forgotten .
Excellent vice !
Will ye be won ? look stedfastly upon me , Look manly , take a mans affections to you ; Young women , in the old world were not wont , Sir , To hang out gaudy bushes for their beauties , To talk themselves into young mens affections ; How cold and dull you are !
How I stagger ! She is wise , as fair ; but 't is a wicked wisdom ; I'le choak before I yield .
Who waits within there ? [ Zabulon within.Make ready the green Chamber .
It shall be Madam .
I am afraid she will injoy me indeed .
What Musick do ye love ?
A modest tongue .
We'l have enough of that : fye , fye , how lumpish ! In a young Ladyes arms thus dull ?
For Heaven sakeProfess a little goodness .
Of what Country ?
I am of Rome .
Nay then I know you mock me , The Italians are not frighted with such bug-bears , Prethee go in .
I am not well .
I'le make thee , I'le kiss thee well .
I am not sick of that sore .
Upon my Conscience , I must ravish thee , I shall be famous for the first example : With this I'le tye ye first , then try your strength Sir .
My strength ? away base woman , I abhor thee.I am not caught with stales , disease dwell with thee. [ Exit .
Are ye so quick ? and have I lost my wishes ? Hoe , Zabulon ; my servants .
Zabulon and Servants .
Call 'd ye Madam ?
Is all that beauty scorned , so many su 'd for ; So many Princes ? by a stranger too ? Must I endure this ?
Where 's the Gentleman ?
Go presently , pursue the stranger , Zabulon.He has broke from me , Jewels I have given him : Charge him with theft : he has stoln my love , my freedome , Draw him before the Governour , imprison him , Why dost thou stay ?
I'le teach him a new dance , For playing fast and loose with such a Lady.Come fellows , come : I'le execute your anger , And to the full .
His scorn shall feel my vengeance. -- [ Exeunt .

Shall I never see a lusty man again ?

Where 's the French-man ?
Alas , he 's all to fitters , and lyes , taking the height of his fortune with a Syringe.He 's chin 'd , he 's chin 'd good man , he is a mourner .
What 's become of the Dane ?
Who ? goldy-locks ? He 's foul i'th ' touch-hole ; and recoils again , The main Spring 's weaken 'd that holds up his cock , He lies at the sign of the Sun , to be new breech 'd .
The Rutter too , is gone .
O that was a brave Rascal , He would labour like a Thrasher : but alasWhat thing can ever last ? he has been ill mew 'd , And drawn too soon ; I have seen him in the Hospital .
There was an English-man .
I there was an English-man ; You'l scant find any now , to make that name good : There were those English that were men indeed , And would perform like men , but now they are vanisht : They are so taken up in their own Country , And so beaten of their speed by their own women , When they come here , they draw their legs like Hackneys : Drink , and their own devices have undone 'em .
I must have one that 's strong , no life in Lisbon else , Perfect and young : my Custom with young Ladies , And high fed City dames , will fall , and break else.I want my self too , in mine age to nourish me : They are all sunk I mantain 'd : now what 's this business , What goodly fellow 's that ?
Rutilio and Officers .
Why do you drag me ? Pox o ' your justice ; let me loose .
Not so Sir .
Can not a man fall into one of your drunken Cellars , And venture the breaking on 's neck , your trap-doors open , But he must be us 'd thus rascally ?
What made you wandringSo late i'th ' night ? you know that is imprisonment .
May be I walk in my sleep .
May be we'l walk ye.What made you wandring Sir , into that vaultWhere all the City store , and the Munition lay ?
I fell into it by chance , I broke my shins for't : Your worships feel not that : I knockt my headAgainst a hundred posts , would you had had it. Can not I break my neck in my own defence ?
This will not serve : you can not put it off so , Your coming thither was to play the villain , To fire the Powder , to blow up that part o'th ' City .
Yes , with my nose : why were the trap-doors open ? Might not you fall , or you , had you gone that way ? I thought your City had sunk .
You did your best Sir , We must presume , to help it into th ' Air , If you call that sinking : we have told you what 's the law , He that is taken there , unless a Magistrate , And have command in that place , presentlyIf there be nothing found apparent near himWorthy his torture , or his present death , Must either pay his fine for his presumption , ( Which is six hundred Duckets ) or for six yearsTug at an Oar i'th ' Gallies : will ye walk Sir , For we presume you can not pay the penalty .
Row in the Gallies , after all this mischief ?
May be you were drunk , they'l keep you sober there .
Tug at an Oar ? you are not arrant rascals , To catch me in a pit-fall , and betray me ?
A lusty minded man .
A wondrous able .
Pray Gentlemen , allow me but that libertyTo speak a few words with your prisoner , And I shall thank you .
Take your pleasure Lady .
What would you give that woman should redeem ye , Redeem ye from this slavery ?
Besides my serviceI would give her my whole self , I would be her vassal .
She has reason to expect as much , consideringThe great sum she pays for't , yet take comfort , What ye shall do to merit this , is easie , And I will be the woman shall befriend ye , 'T is but to entertain some handsome Ladies , And young fair Gentlewomen : you guess the way : But giving of your mind --
I am excellent at it : You can not pick out such another living.I understand ye : is't not thus ?
Ye have it .
Bring me a hundred of 'em : I'le dispatch 'em.I will be none but yours : should another offerAnother way to redeem me , I should scorn it.What women you shall please : I am monstrous lusty : Not to be taken down : would you have Children ? I'le get you those as fast , and thick as flie-blows .
I admire him : wonder at him !
Hark ye Lady , You may require sometimes --
I by my faith .
And you shall have it by my faith , and handsomly : This old Cat will suck shrewdly : you have no Daughters ? I flye at all : now am I in my Kingdom.Tug at an Oar ? no , tug in a Feather-bed , With good warm Caudles ; hang your bread and water , I'le make you young again , believe that Lady.I will so frubbish you .
Come , follow Officers , This Gentleman is free : I'le pay the Duckets .
And when you catch me in your City-powdring-tubAgain , boil me with Cabbidge .

Leopold , Hippolyta , Zenocia .
Will your Ladyship wear this Dressing ?
Leave thy prating : I care not what I wear .
Yet 't is my dutyTo know your pleasure , and my worst afflictionTo see you discontented .
Weeping too ? Prethee forgive me : I am much distemper 'd , And speak I know not what : to make thee amendsThe Gown that I wore yesterday , is thine ; Let it alone awhile .
Now you perceive , And taste her bounty .
Much above my merit .
But have you not yet found a happy timeTo move for me .
I have watched all occasions , But hitherto , without success : yet doubt notBut I'le embrace the first means .
Do , and prosper : Excellent creature , whose perfections makeEven sorrow lovely , if your frowns thus take me , What would your smiles doe ?
Pox o ' this stale Courtship : If I have any power .
I am commanded , Obedience is the Lovers sacrificeWhich I pay gladly .
To be forc 'd to wooe , Being a woman , could not but torment me , But bringing for my advocates , youth and beauty , Set off with wealth , and then to be deni 'd tooDo 's comprehend all tortures. They flatter 'd me , That said my looks were charms , my touches fetters , My locks soft chains , to bind the arms of Princes , And make them in that wish 'd for bondage , happy.I am like others of a coarser feature , As weak to allure , but in my dotage , stronger : I am no Circe ; he , more than Ulysses , Scorns all my offer 'd bounties , slights my favours , And , as I were some new Egyptian , flyes me , Leaving no pawn , but my own shame behind him.But he shall finde , that in my fell revenge , I am a woman : one that never pardonsThe rude contemner of her proffered sweetness .
Zabulon .
Madam , 't is done .
What 's done ?
The uncivill strangerIs at your suite arrested .
'T is well handled .
And under guard sent to the Governour , With whom my testimony , and the favourHe bears your Ladiship , have so prevail'dThat he is sentenc 'd .
How ?
To lose his head .
Is that the means to quench the scorching heatOf my inrag 'd desires ? must innocence suffer , 'Cause I am faulty ? or is my Love so fatallThat of necessity it must destroyThe object it most longs for ? dull Hippolyta , To think that injuries could make way for love , When courtesies were despis 'd : that by his deathThou shouldst gain that , which only thou canst hope forWhile he is living : My honour 's at the stake now , And can not be preserv 'd , unless he perish , The enjoying of the thing I love , I everHave priz 'd above my fame : why doubt I now then ? One only way is left me , to redeem all : Make ready my Caroch .
What will you Madam ?
And yet I am impatient of such stay : Bind up my hair : fye , fye , while that is doingThe Law may seise his life : thus as I am then , Not like Hippolyta , but a BacchanalMy frantique Love transports me. [ Exit .
Sure she 's distracted .
Pray you follow her : I will along with you : I more than ghess the cause : women that loveAre most uncertain , and one minute crave , What in another they refuse to have. [ Exit .

Assure thy self Charino , I am alter'dFrom what I was ; the tempests we have met withIn our uncertain voyage , were smooth galesCompar 'd to those , the memory of my lustsRais 'd in my Conscience : and if ere againI live to see Zenocia , I will sue , And seek to her as a Lover , and a Servant , And not command affection , like a Tyrant .
In hearing this , you make me young again , And Heaven , it seems , favouring this good change in youIn setting of a period to our dangersGives us fair hopes to find that here in LisbonWhich hitherto in vain we long have sought for.I have receiv 'd assur 'd intelligence , Such strangers have been seen here : and though yetI can not learn their fortunes , nor the placeOf their abode , I have a Soul presagesA fortunate event here .
There have pass'dA mutual enterchange of courtesiesBetween me , and the Governour ; therefore boldlyWe may presume of him , and of his powerIf we finde cause to use them , otherwiseI would not be known here , and these disguisesWill keep us from discovery .
Manuel , Doctor , Arnoldo , Guard .
What are these ?
The Governour : with him my Rival , bound .
For certain 't is Arnoldo .
Let 's attendWhat the success will be .
Is't possibleThere should be hope of his recovery , His wounds so many and so deadly ?
So they appear 'd at first , but the blood stop 'd , His trance forsook him , and on better searchWe found they were not mortal .
Use all careTo perfect this unhop 'd for cure : that donePropose your own rewards : and till you shallHear farther from me , for some ends I have , Conceal it from his Mother .
Wee'l not fail Sir. [ Exit .
You still stand confident on your innocence .
It is my best and last guard , which I will notLeave , to relye on your uncertain mercy .

Who bad you follow me ! Goe home , and you Sir , As you respect me , goe with her .
Zenocia ! And in her house a Servant !
'T is my Daughter .
My love ? Contain your joy , observe the sequel. [ Zen. passes .
Fye Madam , how undecent 't is for you , So far unlike your self to bee seen thusIn th ' open streets ? why do you kneel ? pray you rise , I am acquainted with the wrong , and lossYou have sustain 'd , and the Delinquent nowStands ready for his punishment .
Let it fall , Sir , On the offender : he is innocent , And most unworthy of these bonds he wears , But I made up of guilt .
What strange turn 's this ?
This was my prisoner once .
What ere you are , so much I love your vertue , That I desire your friendship : do you unloose himFrom those bonds , you are worthy of : your repentanceMakes part of satisfaction ; yet I mustSeverely reprehend you .
I am madeA stale on all parts : But this fellow shallPay dearly for her favour .
My life 's so fullOf various changes , that I now despairOf any certain port ; one trouble ending , A new , and worse succeeds it : what should ZenociaDo in this womans house ? Can chastityAnd hot Lust dwell together without infection ? I would not be or jealous , or secure , Yet something must be done , to sound the depth o n't : That she lives is my bliss , but living there , A hell of torments ; there 's no way to herIn whom I live , but by this door , through whichTo me 't is death to enter , yet I must , And will make tryal .
Let me hear no moreOf these devices , Lady : this I pardon , And at your intercession I forgiveYour instrument the Jew too : get you home.The hundred thousand crowns you lent the CityTowards the setting forth of the last NavyBound for the Islands , was a good then , whichI ballance with your ill now .
Now Sir , to him , You know my Daughter needs it .
Let me takeA farewell with mine eye , Sir , though my lipBe barr 'd the Ceremonie , courtesieAnd Custom too allows of .
Gentle Madam , I neither am so cold , nor so ill bredBut that I dare receive it : you are unguarded , And let me tell you that I am asham'dOf my late rudeness , and would gladly thereforeIf you please to accept my ready serviceWait on you to your house .

Yes Sir , and honour you : ever remembringYour many bounties , being ambitious onlyTo give you cause to say by some one serviceThat I am not ungratefull .

When you think fit Sir , And then as a command I will receive it , Till when , most welcom : you are welcom too Sir , 'T is spoken from the heart , and therefore needs notMuch protestation : at your better leisureI will enquire the cause that brought you hither : In the mean time serve you .
You out-doe me Sir. [ Exeunt .
Duarte , Doctor .
You have bestow 'd on me a second life , For which I live your creature , and have better'dWhat nature fram 'd unperfect , my first beingInsolent pride made monstrous ; but this laterIn learning me to know my self , hath taught meNot to wrong others .
Then we live indeed , When we can goe to rest without alarmGiven every minute to a guilt-sick conscienceTo keep us waking , and rise in the morningSecure in being innocent : but whenIn the remembrance of our worser actionsWe ever bear about us whips and furies , To make the day a night of sorrow to us , Even life 's a burthen .
I have found and felt it ; But will endeavour having first made peaceWith those intestine enemies my rude passions , To be so with man-kind : but worthy Doctor , Pray if you can resolve me ; was the GentlemanThat left me dead , ere brought unto his tryal ?
Not known , nor apprehended .
That 's my grief .
Why , do you wish he had been punished ?
No , The stream of my swoln sorrow runs not that way : For could I find him , as I vow to HeavenIt shall be my first care to seek him out , I would with thanks acknowledge that his sword , In opening my veins , which proud bloud poison 'd , Gave the first symptoms of true health .
'T is in youA Christian resolution : that you liveIs by the Governours , your Uncles chargeAs yet conceal'd. And though a sons loss neverWas solemniz 'd with more tears of true sorrowThan have been paid by your unequal 'd MotherFor your supposed death , she 's not acquaintedWith your recovery .
For some few dayesPray let her so continue : thus disguis'dI may abroad unknown .
Without suspicionOf being discovered .
I am confidentNo moisture sooner dies than womens tears , And therefore though I know my Mother vertuous , Yet being one of that frail sex I purposeHer farther tryal .
That as you think fit -- I'le not betray you .
To find out this strangerThis true Physician of my mind and mannersWere such a blessing. He seem 'd poor , and mayPerhaps be now in want ; would I could find him.The Innes I'le search first , then the publick Stewes ; He was of Italy , and that Country breeds notPrecisians that way , but hot Libertines ; And such the most are : 't is but a little travail : I am unfurnisht too , pray Mr. Doctor , Can you supply me ?
With what summ you please .
I will not be long absent .
That I wish too ; For till you have more strength , I would not have youTo be too bold .
Fear not , I will be carefull. [ Exeunt .
Leopold , Zabulon , Bravo .
I have brought him Sir , a fellow that will do itThough Hell stood in his way , ever providedYou pay him for't .
He has a strange aspect , And looks much like the figure of a hang-manIn a table of the Passion .
He transcendsAll precedents , believe it , a flesh 'd ruffian , That hath so often taken the Strappado , That 't is to him but as a lofty trickIs to a tumbler : he hath perused tooAll Dungeons in Portu [ g ] al , thrice seven yearsRowed in the Galleys for three several murthers , Though I presume that he has done a hundred , And scap't unpunisht .
He is much in debt to you , You set him off so well. What will you take SirTo beat a fellow for me , that thus wrong 'd me ?
To beat him say you ?
Yes , beat him to lameness , To cut his lips or nose off ; any thing , That may disfigure him .
Let me consider ? Five hundred pistolets for such a serviceI think were no dear penniworth .
Five hundred ! Why there are of your Brother-hood in the City , I'le undertake , shall kill a man for twenty .
Kill him ? I think so ; I'le kill any manFor half the mony .
And will you ask moreFor a sound beating than a murther ?
I Sir , And with good reason , for a dog that 's dead , The Spanish proverb says , will never bite : But should I beat or hurt him only , he mayRecover , and kill me .
A good conclusion , The obduracie of this rascal makes me tender.I'le run some other course , there 's your rewardWithout the employment .
For that as you please Sir ; When you have need to kill a man , pray use me , But I am out at beating. [ Exit .
What 's to be done then ?
I'le tell thee Zabulon , and make thee privyTo my most near designs : this stranger , which
so dotes on , was my prisonerWhen the last Virgin , I bestowed upon her , Was made my prize ; how he escaped , hereafterI'le let thee know ; and it may be the loveHe bears the servant , makes him scorn the Mistris .
'T is not unlike ; for the first time he saw herHis looks exprest so much , and for more proofSince he came to my Ladys house , though yetHe never knew her , he hath practis 'd with meTo help him to a conference , withoutThe knowledge of Hippolyta ; which I promis 'd .
And by all means perform it for their meeting , But work it so , that my disdainful Mistris ( Whom , notwithstanding all her injuries , 'T is my hard fate to love ) may see and hear them .
To what end Sir ?
This Zabulon : when she seesWho is her rival , and her Lovers basenessTo leave a Princess for her bondwoman , The sight will make her scorn , what now she dotes on , I'le double thy reward .
You are like to speed then : For I confess what you will soon believe , We serve them best that are most apt to give , For you , I'le place you where you shall see all , and yet be unobserv 'd .
That I desire too. [ Exeunt .
Arnoldo .
I can not see her yet , how it afflicts meThe poyson of this place should mix it selfWith her pure thoughts ? 'T was she that was commanded , Or my eyes failed me grosly ; that youth , that faceAnd all that noble sweetness. May she not live here , And yet be honest still ?
Zenocia .
It is Arnoldo , From all his dangers free ; fortune I bless thee.My noble husband ! how my joy swells in me , But why in this place ? what business hath he here ? He can not hear of me , I am not known here.I left him vertuous ; how I shake to think now ! And how that joy I had , cools , and forsakes me !
Hippolyta and Zabulon.This Lady is but fair , I have been thought soWithout compare admired ; She has bewitched himAnd he forgot --
'T is she again , the same -- the same Zenocia .
There they are together. -- Now you may mark .
Peace , let 'em parly .
That you are well Zenocia , and once moreBless my despairing eyes , with your wisht presence , I thank the gods ; but that I meet you here --
They are acquainted .
I found that secret Madam , When you co [ m ] manded her go home : pray hear 'em .
That you meet me here , ne 're blush at that Arnoldo.Your coming comes too late : I am a woman , And one woman with another may be trusted ; Do you fear the house ?
More than a fear , I know it , Know it not good , not honest .
What do you here then ? I'th ' name of vertue why do you approach it ? Will you confess the doubt and yet pursue it ? Where have your eyes been wandring , my Arnoldo ? What constancy , what faith do you call this ? Fie , Aim at one wanton mark , and wound another ? I do confess , the Lady fair , most beauteous , And able to betray a strong mans liberty , [ Leopold places himself unseen below.But you that have a love , a wife -- you do wellTo deal thus wisely with me : yet Arnoldo , Since you are pleas 'd to study a new beauty , And think this old and ill , beaten with misery , Study a nobler way for shame to love me , Wrong not her honesty .
You have confirm 'd me .
Who though she be your wife , will never hinder you , So much I rest a servant to your wishes , And love your Loves , though they be my destructions , No man shall know me , nor the share I have in thee , No eye suspect I am able to prevent you , For since I am a slave to this great Lady , Whom I perceive you follow,
Be not blinded .
Fortune shall make me useful to your service , I will speak for you .
Speak for me ? you wrong me .
I will endeavour all the wayes I am ableTo make her think well of you ; will that please ? To make her dote upon you , dote to madness , So far against my self I will obey you.But when that 's done , and I have shewed this duty , This great obedience , few will buy it at my price , Thus will I shake hands with you , wish you well , But never see you more , nor receive comfortFrom any thing , Arnoldo .
You are too tender ; I neither doubt you , nor desire longerTo be a man , and live , than I am honestAnd only yours ; our infinite affectionsAbus 'd us both .
Where are your favours now ? The courtesies you shew 'd this stranger , Madam ?
Have I now found the cause ?
Attend it further .
Did she invite you , do you say ?
Most cunningly , And with a preparation of that stateI was brought in and welcom 'd .
Seem 'd to love you ?
Most infinitely , at first sight , most dotingly .
She is a goodly Lady .
Wondrous handsom : At first view , being taken unprepar 'd , Your memory not present then to assist me , She seem 'd so glorious sweet , and so far stir 'd me , Nay be not jealous , there 's no harm done .
Prethee -- didst thou not kiss , Arnoldo ?
Yes faith did I .
And then --
I durst not , did not --
I forgive you , Come tell the truth .
May be I lay with her .
He mocks me too , most basely .
Did ye faith ? did ye forget so far ?
Come , come , no weeping ; I would have lyen first in my grave , believe that.Why will you ask those things you would not hear ? She is too untemperate to betray my vertues , Too openly lascivious : had she dealtBut with that seeming modesty she might , And flung a little Art upon her ardor , But 't was forgot , and I forgot to like her , And glad I was deceiv'd. No my Zenocia , My first love here begun , rests here unreapt yet , And here for ever .
You have made me happy , Even in the midst of bondage blest .
You see nowWhat rubs are in your way .
And quickly ZabulonI'le root 'em out. -- Be sure you do this presently .
Do not you alter then .
I am resolute. [ Exit Zabulon .
To see you only I came hither last , Drawn by no love of hers , nor base allurements , For by this holy light I hate her heartily .
I am glad of that , you have sav 'd me so much vengeanceAnd so much fear , From this hour fair befal you .
Some means I shall make shortly to redeem you , Till when , observe her well , and fit her temper , Only her lust contemn .
When shall I see you ?
I will live hereabouts , and bear her fair still , Till I can find a fit hour to redeem you .
Shut all the doors .
Who 's that ?
We are betray 'd , The Lady of the house has heard our parly , Seen us , and seen our Loves .
You courteous Gallant , You that scorn all I can bestow , that laugh atThe afflictions , and the groans I suffer for you , That slight and jeer my love , contemn the fortuneMy favours can fling on you , have I caught you ? Have I now found the cause ? ye fool my wishes ; Is mine own slave , my bane ? I nourish thatThat sucks up my content. I'le pray no more , Nor wooe no more ; thou shalt see foolish man , And to thy bitter pain and anguish , look onThe vengeance I shall take , provok 'd and slighted ; Redeem her then , and steal her hence : ho ZabulonNow to your work .
Zabulon , and Servants , some holding Arnoldo,
Zenocia .
Lady , but hear me speak first , As you have pity .
I have none. You taught me , When I even hung about your neck , you scorn 'd me .
Shall we pluck yet ?
No , hold a little Zabulon , I'le pluck his heart-strings first : now am I worthyA little of your love ?
I'le be your Servant , Command me through what danger you shall aime at , Let it be death .
Be sure Sir , I shall fit you .
But spare this Virgin .
I would spare that villain first , Had cut my Fathers throat .
Bounteous Lady , If in your sex there be that noble softness , That tenderness of heart , women are crown 'd for --
Kneel not Arnoldo , doe her not that honour , She is not worthy such submission , I scorn a life depends upon her pity.Proud woman do thy worst , and arm thy angerWith thoughts as black as Hell , as hot and bloody , I bring a patience here , shall make 'em blush , An innocence , shall outlook thee , and death too .
Make me your slave , I give my freedom to ye , For ever to be fetter 'd to your service ; 'T was I offended , be not so unjust then , To strike the innocent , this gentle maidNever intended fear and doubt against you : She is your Servant , pay not her observanceWith cruel looks , her duteous faith with death .
Am I fair now ? now am I worth your liking ?
Not fair , not to be liked , thou glorious Devil , Thou vernisht piece of lust , thou painted fury .
Speak gently sweet , speak gently .
I'le speak nobly.'Tis not the saving of a life I aim at , Mark me lascivious woman , mark me truly , And then consider , how I weigh thy anger.Life is no longer mine , nor dear unto me , Than usefull to his honour I preserve it.If thou hadst studied all the courtesiesHumanity and noble blood are linkt to , Thou couldst not have propounded such a benefit , Nor heapt upon me such unlookt for honourAs dying for his sake , to be his Martyr , 'T is such a grace .
You shall not want that favour , Let your bones work miracles .
Dear LadyBy those fair eyes --
There is but this way left yeTo save her life. --
Speak it , and I embrace it .
Come to my private chamber presently , And there , what love and I command --
I'le doe it , Be comforted Zenocia .
Do not do thisTo save me , do not lose your self I charge you , I charge you by your love , that love [ you ] bear me ; That love , that constant love you have twin 'd to me , By all your promises , take heed you keep 'em , Now is your constant tryal. If thou dost this , Or mov'st one foot , to guide thee to her lust , My curses and eternal hate pursue thee.Redeem me at the base price of dis-loyalty ? Must my undoubted honesty be thy Bawd too ? Go and intwine thy self about that body ; Tell her , for my life thou hast lost thine honour , Pull 'd all thy vows from heaven , basely , most baselyStoop 'd to the servile flames of that foul woman , To add an hour to me that hate thee for it , Know thee not again , nor name thee for a Husband .
What shall I do to save her ?
How now , what hast there ?
Servant .
The Governour , attended with some Gentlemen , Are newly entred , to speak with your Ladiship .
Pox o ' their business , reprieve her for this hour , I shall have other time .
Now fortune help us .
I'le meet 'em presently : retire awhile all. [ Exeunt .
You rise to day upon your right side Lady ; You know the danger too , and may prevent it , And if you suffer her to perish thus , As she must do , and suddenly , believe it , Unless you stand her friend ; you know the way o n't , I guess you poorly love her , less your fortune.Let her know nothing , and perform this matter , There are hours ordained for several businesses , You understand .
I understand you Bawd Sir , And such a Counsellour I never car 'd for .
Governour , Clodio , Leopold , Charino andAttendants at one door , Hippolyta at the other .
Your Lordship does me honour .
Fair Hippolyta , I am come to ease you of a charge .
I keep noneI count a burthen Sir : and yet I lye too .
Which is the Maid ; is she here ?
Yes Sir , This is she , this is Zenocia , The very same I sued to your Lordship for .
Clodio again ? more misery ? more ruin ? Under what angry star is my life govern 'd ?
Come hither Maid , you are once more a free woman , Here I discharge your bonds .
Another smile , Another trick of fortune to betray us !
Why does your Lordship use me so unnobly ? Against my will to take away my bond-woman ?
She was no lawful prize , therefore no bond-woman : She 's of that Country we hold friendship with , And ever did , and therefore to be usedWith entertainment , fair and courteous.The breach of League in us gives foul example , Therefore you must be pleas 'd to think this honest ; Did you know what she was ?
Not till this instant ; For had I known her , she had been no prisoner .
There , take the Maid , she is at her own dispose now , And if there be ought else to do your honourAny poor service in --
I am vowed your servant .
Your Father 's here too , that 's our only comfort , And in a Country now , we stand free people , Where Clodio has no power , be comforted .
I fear some trick yet .
Be not so dejected .
You must not be displeas 'd ; so farewel Lady.Come Gentlemen ; Captain , you must with me too , I have a little business .
I attend your Lordship : Now my way 's free , and my hope 's Lord again. [ Exeunt all but Hip. and Zab .
D 'ye jeer me now ye are going ? I may live yet -- to make you howl both .
You might have done ; you had power then , But now the chains are off , the command lost , And such a story they will make of thisTo laugh out lazie time .
No means yet left me ? For now I burst with anger : none to satisfie me ? No comfort ? no revenge ?
You speak too late ; You might have had all these , your useful servants , Had you been wise , and suddain : what power , or willOver her beauty , have you now ? by violenceTo constrain his love ; she is as free as you are , And no law can impeach her liberty , And whilst she is so , Arnoldo will despise you .
Either my love or anger must be satisfied , Or I must dye .
I have a way wou 'd do it , Wou 'd do it yet , protect me from the Law .
From any thing ; thou knowest what power I have , What mony , and what friends .
'T is a devilish one : But such must now be us 'd : walk in , I'le tell you ; And if you like it , if the Devil can do any thing --
Devil , or what thou wilt , so I be satisfied. [ Ex .
Sulpitia , and Jaques .
This is the rarest and the lustiest fellow , And so bestirs himself --
Give him breath Mistress , You'l melt him else .
He does perform such wonders -- The women are mad on him .
Give him breath I say ; The man is but a man , he must have breath .
How many had he yesterday ? And they paid bravely too .
About fourteen , But still I cry give breath , spare him and have him .
Five Dames to day ; this was a small stage , He may endure five more .
Breath , breath I cry still ; Body o ' me give breath , the man 's a lost man else.Feed him and give him breath .
2 Gentlewomen .
Welcome Gentlewomen , Y'are very welcome .
We hear you have a lusty and well complexion 'd fellowThat does rare tricks ; my Sister and my self here , Would trifle out an hour or two , so please you .
Jaques , conduct 'em in .
There 's for your courtesie. [ Ex. Jaq. and Gent .
Good pay still , good round pay , this happy fellowWill set me up again ; he brings in goldFaster than I have leisure to receive it.O that his body were not flesh and fading ; But I'le so pap him up -- nothing too dear for him ; What a sweet scent he has ? -- Now what news Jaques ?
He can not last , I pity the poor man , I suffer for him ; two Coaches of young City dames , And they drive as the Devil were in the wheels , Are ready now to enter : and behind theseAn old dead-palsied Lady in a Litter , And she makes all the haste she can : the man 's lost , You may gather up his dry bones to make Nine-pins , But for his flesh .
These are but easie laboursYet , for I know he must have rest .
He must -- you 'll beat him off his legs else presently .
Go in , and bid him please himself , I am pleas 'd too : To morrow 's a new day ; but if he canI would have him take pity o ' the old Lady.Alas 't is charity .
I'le tell him all this , And if he be not too fool-hardy .
Zabulon .
How now ? What news with you ?
You must presentlyShew all the art you have , and for my Lady .
She may command .
You must not dream nor trifle .
Which way ?
A spell you must prepare , a powerful one , Peruse but these directions , you shall find all ; There is the picture too , be quick , and faithful , And do it with that strength -- when 't is perform 'd , Pitch your reward at what you please , you have it .
I'le do my best , and suddenly : but hark ye , Will you never lye at home again ?
Excuse me , I have too much business yet .
I am right glad o n't .
Think on your business , so farewel .
I'le do it .
Within this hour I'le visit you againAnd give you greater lights .
I shall observe ye ; This brings a brave reward , bravely I'le do it , And all the hidden art I have , express in't. [ Exeunt at both doors .
Rutilio with a Night-cap .
Now do I look as if I were Crow-trodden , Fye , how my hams shrink under me ! O me , I am broken-winded too ; is this a life ? Is this the recreation I have aim 'd at ? I had a body once , a handsome body , And wholesome too. Now I appear like a rascal , That had been hung a year or two in Gibbets.Fye how I faint ! women ? keep me from women ; Place me before a Cannon , 't is a pleasure ; Stretch me upon a Rack , a recreation ; But women ? women ? O the Devil ! women ?
Gulf was never half so dangerous.Is there no way to find the Trap-door again , And fall into the Cellar , and be taken ? No lucky fortune to direct me that way ? No Gallies to be got , nor yet no Gallows ? For I fear nothing now , no earthly thingBut these unsatisfied Men-leeches , women.How devilishly my bones ake ! O the old Lady ! I have a kind of waiting-woman lyes cross my back too , O how she stings ! no treason to deliver me ? Now what are you ? do you mock me ?
3. with Night-caps very faintly .
No Sir , no ; We were your Predecessors in this place .
And come to see you bear up .
Good Gentlemen ; You seem to have a snuffing in your head Sir , A parlous snuffing , but this same dampish air --
A dampish air indeed .
Blow your face tenderly , Your nose will ne 're endure it : mercy o ' me , What are men chang 'd to here ? is my nose fast yet ? Me thinks it shakes i'th ' hilts : pray tell me gentlemen , How long is't since you flourisht here ?
Not long since .
Move your self easily , I see you are tender , Nor long endured .
The labour was so much Sir , And so few to perform it --
Must I come to this ? And draw my legs after me like a lame Dog ? I can not run away , I am too feeble : Will you sue for this place again Gentlemen ?
No truly Sir , the place has been too warm for our complexions.We have enough o n't , rest you merry Sir , We came but to congratulate your fortune , You have abundance .
Bear your fortune soberly , And so we leave you to the next fair Lady. [ Ex. the 3 .
Stay but a little , and I'le meet you Gentlemen , At the next Hospital : there 's no living thus , Nor am I able to endure it longer , With all the helps and heats that can be given me , I am at my trot already : they are fair and youngMost of the women that repair unto me , But they stick on like Burs , shake me like Feathers .
Sulpitia.More Women yet ? Would I were honestly marriedTo any thing that had but half a face , And not a groat to keep her , nor a smock , That I might be civilly merry when I pleased , Rather than labouring in these Fulling-mills .
By this the spell begins to work : you are lusty , I see you bear up bravely yet .
Do you hear Lady , Do not make a game-bear of me , to play me hourly , And fling on all your whelps ; it would not hold ; Play me with some discretion ; to day one course , And two dayes hence another .
If you be so angryPay back the mony I redeem 'd you atAnd take your course , I can have men enough : You have cost me a hundred crowns since you came hither , In Broths and strength [ n ] ing Caudles ; till you do pay me , If you will eat and live , you shall endeavour , I'le chain you to't else .
Make me a Dog-kennel , I'le keep your house and bark , and feed on bare bones , And be whipt out o ' doors , Do you mark me Lady ? whipt , I'le eat old shoes .
Duarte .
In this house I am toldThere is a stranger , of a goodly person , And such a one there was ; if I could see him , I yet remember him .
Your business Sir , If it be for a woman , ye are couzen 'd , I keep none here. [ Exit .
Certain this is the Gentleman ; The very same .
Death , if I had but mony , Or any friend to bring me from this bondage , I would Thresh , set up a Cobler 's shop , keep Hogs , And feed with 'em , sell Tinder-boxes , And Knights of Ginger-bread , Thatch for threeHalf pence a day , and think it Lordly , From this base Stallion trade : why does he eye me , Eye me so narrowly ?
It seems you are troubled Sir , I heard you speak of want .
'T is better hearingFar , than relieving Sir .
I do not think so , you know me not .
Not yet that I remember .
You shall , and for your friend : I am beholding to ye , Greatly beholding Sir ; if you remember , You fought with such a man , they call 'd Duarte , A proud distemper 'd man : he was my enemy , My mortal foe , you slew him fairly , nobly .
Speak softly Sir , you do not mean to betray me , I wisht the Gallows , now th'are coming fairly .
Be confident , for as I live , I love you , And now you shall perceive it : for that service , Me , and my purse command : there , take it to ye , 'T is gold , and no small sum , a thousand Duckets , Supply your want .
But do you do this faithfully ?
If I mean ill , spit in my face and kick me : In what else I may serve you , Sir --
I thank you , This is as strange to me as Knights adventures.I have a project , 't is an honest one , And now I'le tempt my fortune .
Trust me with it .
You are so good and honest I must trust ye , 'T is but to carry a letter to a LadyThat sav 'd my life once .
That will be most thankful , I will do't with all care .
Where are you , white-broth ? Now lusty blood , Come in , and tell your mony : 'T is ready here , no threats , nor no orations , Nor prayers now .
You do not mean to leave me .
I'le live in Hell sooner than here , and cooler.Come quickly come , dispatch , this air 's unwho [ l ] som : Quickly good Lady , quickly to't .
Well , since it must be , The next I'le fetter faster sure , and closer .
And pick his bones , as y'have done mine , pox take ye .
At my lodging for a while , you shall be quartered , And there take Physick for your health .
I thank ye , I have found my angel now too , if I can keep him. [ Exeunt omnes .
You like the Letter ?
Yes , but I must tell youYou tempt a desperate hazard , to solliciteThe mother , ( and the grieved one too , 't is rumor 'd ) Of him you slew so lately .
I have told youSome proofs of her affection , and I know notA nearer way to make her satisfactionFor a lost Son , than speedily to help herTo a good Husband ; one that will begetBoth Sons and Daughters , if she be not barren.I have had a breathing now , and have recoveredWhat I lost in my late service , 't was a hot one : It fired and fired me ; but all thanks to you Sir , You have both freed and cool 'd me .
What is done Sir , I thought well done , and was in that rewarded , And therefore spare your thanks .
I'le no more Whoring : This fencing 'twixt a pair of sheets , more wears oneThan all the exercise in the world besides.To be drunk with good Canary , a meer JulipOr like gourd-water to't ; twenty SurfeitsCome short of one nights work there. If I get this LadyAs ten to one I shall , I was ne 're denied yet , I will live wondrous honestly ; walk before herGravely and demurelyAnd then instruct my family ; you are sad , What do you muse on Sir ?
Truth I was thinkingWhat course to take for the delivery of your letter , And now I have it : but faith did this Lady ( For do not gull your self ) for certain know , You kill 'd her Son ?
Give me a Book I'le swear't ; Denyed me to the Officers , that pursued me , Brought me her self to th ' door , then gave me goldTo bear my charges , and shall I make doubt thenBut that she lov 'd me ? I am confidentTime having ta'ne her grief off , that I shall beMost welcome to her : for then to have wooed herHad been unseasonable .
Well Sir , there 's more mony , To ma [ ke ] you handsome ; I'le about your business : You know where you must stay ?
There you shall find me : Would I could meet my Brother now , to know , Whether the Jew , his Genius , or my Christian , Has prov 'd the better friend. [ Exit .
O who would trustDeceiving woman ! or believe that oneThe best , and most Canoniz 'd ever wasMore than a seeming goodness ? I could rail nowAgainst the sex , and curse it ; but the theamAnd way 's too common : yet that GuiomarMy Mother ; ( nor let that forbid her to beThe wonder of our nation ) she that wasMark 'd out the great example , for all MatronsBoth Wife and Widow ; she that in my breedingExprest the utmost of a Mothers care , And tenderness to a Son ; she that yet feignsSuch sorrow for me ; good God , that this mother , After all this , should give up to a stranger , The wreak she ow 'd her Son ; I fear her honour.That he was sav 'd , much joyes me , and grieve onlyThat she was his preserver. I'le try further , And by this Engine , find whether the tears , Of which she is so prodigal , are for me , Or us 'd to cloak her base hypocrisie. [ Exit .
Hippolyta and Sulpitia .
Are you assur 'd the charm prevails ?
Do I live ? Or do you speak to me ? Now this very instantHealth takes its last leave of her ; meager palenessLike winter , nips the Roses and the Lilies , The Spring that youth , and love adorn 'd her face with.To force affection , is beyond our art , For I have prov 'd all means that hell has taught me , Or the malice of a woman , which exceeds it , To change Arnoldo 's love , but to no purpose : But for your bond-woman --
Let her pine and dye ; She remov 'd , which like a brighter Sun , Obscures my beams , I may shine out again , And as I have been , be admir 'd and sought to : How long has she to live ?
Lady , beforeThe Sun twice rise and set , be confident , She is but dead ; I know my Charm hath found her.Nor can the Governours Guard ; her lovers tears ; Her Fathers sorrow , or his power that freed her , Defend her from it .
Zabulon .
All things have succeeded , As you could wish ; I saw her brought sick home ; The image of pale death , stampt on her fore-head.Let me adore this second Hecate , This great Commandress , of the fatal Sisters , That as she pleases , can cut short , or lengthenThe thread of life .
Where was she when the inchantmentFirst seis 'd upon her ?
Taking the fresh air , In the company of the Governour , and Count Clodio,
too , was present with her Father , When , in a moment ( so the servants told me ) As she was giving thanks to the Governour , And Clodio , for her unexpected freedom , As if she had been blasted , she sunk down , To their amazement .
'T is thy master-pieceWhich I will so reward , that thou shalt fix here , And with the hazard of thy life , no moreMake tryal of thy powerful Art ; which knownOur Laws call death : off with this Magical Robe , And be thy self .
Governour , Clodio , and Charino .
Stand close , you shall hear more .
You must have patience ; all rage is vain now , And piety forbids , that we should questionWhat is decreed above , or ask a reasonWhy heaven determines this or that way of us .
Heaven has no hand i n't ; 't is a work of hell.Her life hath been so innocent , all her actionsSo free from the suspicion of crime , As rather she deserves a Saints place here , Than to endure , what now her sweetness suffers .
Not for her fault , but mine Sir , Zenocia suffers : The sin I made , when I sought to rase down
love , built on a Rock of truth , Now to the height is punish'd. I profess , Had he no birth , nor parts , the present sorrowHe now expresses for her , does deserve herAbove all Kings , though such had been his rivals .
All ancient stories , of the love of HusbandsTo vertuous Wives , be now no more remembred .
The tales of Turtles , ever be forgotten , Or , for his sake believ 'd .
I have heard , there has beenBetween some married pairs , such sympathy , That th ' Husband has felt really the throwsHis Wife then teeming suffers , this true griefConfirms , 't is not impossible .
We shall findFit time for this hereafter ; let 's use nowAll possible means to help her .
Care , nor cost , Nor what Physicians can do , shall be wanting ; Make use of any means or men .
You are noble. [ Exeunt Man. Clod , and Char .
Ten Colledges of Doctors shall not save her.Her fate is in your hand .
Can I restore her ?
If you command my Art .
I'le dye my self first.And yet I'le go visit her , and seeThis miracle of sorrow in Arnoldo : And 'twere for me , I should change places with her , And dye most happy , such a lovers tearsWere a rich monument , but too good for her , Whose misery I glory in : come Sulpitia , You shall along with me , good ZabulonBe not far off .
I will attend you Madam. [ Exeunt .
Duarte , and a Servant .
I have serv 'd you from my youth , and everYou have found me faithful : that you live 's a treasureI'le lock up here ; nor shall it be let forth , But when you give me warrant .
I relyUpon thy faith ; nay , no more protestations , Too many of them will call that in question , Which now I doubt not : she is there ?
Alone too , But take it on my life , your entertainment , Appearing as you are , will be but course , For the displeasure I shall undergoI am prepar 'd .
Leave me , I'le stand the hazard. [ Exit Servant.The silence that 's observ 'd , her close retirements , No visitants admitted , not the day ; These sable colours , all signs of true sorrow , Or hers is deeply counterfeit. I'le look nearer , Manners give leave -- she sits upon the ground ; By heaven she weeps ; my picture in her hand too ; She kisses it and weeps again .
Guiomar .
Who 's there ?
There is no starting back now Madam .
Ha , another murderer ! I'le not protect thee , Though I have no more Sons .
Your pardon Lady , There 's no such foul fact taints me .
What makes thou here then ? Where are my servants , do none but my sorrowsAttend upon me ? speak , what brought thee hither ?
A will to give you comfort .
Thou art but a man.And 't is beyond a humane reach to do it , If thou could raise the dead out of their graves , Bid time run back , make me now what I was , A happy Mother ; gladly I would hear thee , But that 's impossible .
Please you but read this ; You shall know better there , why I am sent , Than if I should deliver it .
From whom comes it ?
That will instruct you. I suspect this stranger , Yet she spake something that holds such allianceWith his reports ; I know not what to think o n't ; What a frown was there ? she looks me through , & through , Now reads again , now pauses , and now smiles ; And yet there 's more of anger i n't than mirth , These are strange changes ; oh I understand it , She 's full of serious thoughts .
You are just , you Heavens , And never do forget to hear their prayers , That truly pay their vows , the defer 'd vengeance , For you , and my words sake so long defer 'd , Under which as a mountain my heart groans yetWhen 't was despair 'd of , now is offer 'd to me ; And if I lose it , I am both wayes guilty.The womans mask , dissimulation help me.Come hither friend , I am sure you know the Gentleman , That sent these charms .
Charms Lady ?
These charms ; I well may call them so , they 've won upon me , More than ere letter did ; thou art his friend , ( The confidence he has in thee , confirms it ) And therefore I'le be open breasted to thee ; To hear of him , though yet I never saw him , Was most desir 'd of all men ; let me blush , And then I'le say I love him .
All men see , In this a womans vertue .
I expectedFor the courtesie I did , long since to have seen him , And though I then forbad it , you men know , Between our hearts and tongues there 's a large distance ; But I'le excuse him , may be hithertoHe has forborn it , in respect my SonFell by his hand .
And reason Lady .
No , he did me a pleasure i n't , a riotous fellow , And with that insolent , not worth the owning ; I have indeed kept a long solemn sorrow , For my friends sake partly ; but especiallyFor his long absence .
O the Devil .
ThereforeBid him be speedy ; a Priest shall be readyTo tye the holy knot ; this kiss I send him , Deliver that and bring him .
I am dumb : A good cause I have now , and a good sword , And something I shall do , I wait upon you. [ Exeunt .
Manuel , Charino , Arnoldo , Zenocia , born in a chair. 2 Doctors , Clodio .
Give her more air , she dyes else .
O thou dread power , That mad'st this all , and of thy workmanshipThis virgin wife , the Master piece , look down on her ; Let her minds virtues , cloth 'd in this fair garment , That worthily deserves a better nameThan flesh and bloud , now sue , and prevail for her.Or if those are denyed , let innocence , To which all passages in Heaven stand open , Appear in her white robe , before thy throne ; And mediate for her : or if this age of sinBe worthy of a miracle , the SunIn his diurnal progress never sawSo sweet a subject to imploy it on .
Wonders are ceas 'd Sir , we must work by means .
'T is true , and such reverend Physicians are ; To you thus low I fall then ; so may you everBe stil 'd the hands of Heaven , natures restorers ; Get wealth and honours ; and by your success , In all your undertakings , propagateYour great opinion in the world , as nowYou use your saving art ; for know good Gentlemen , Besides the fame , and all that I possess , For a reward , posterity shall standIndebted to you , for ( as Heaven forbid it ) Should my Zenocia dye , robbing this ageOf all that 's good or gracefull , times succeeding , The story of her pure life not yet perfect , Will suffer in the want of her example .
Were all the world to perish with her , weCan do no more , than what art and experienceGive us assurance of , we have us 'd all meansTo find the cause of her disease , yet can not ; How should we then , promise the cure ?
Away , I did bely you , when I charg 'd you withThe power of doing , ye are meer names only , And even your best perfection , accidental ; What ever malady thou art , or Spirit , As some hold all diseases that afflict us , As love already makes me sensibleOf half her sufferings , ease her of her part , And let me stand the butt of thy fell malice , And I will swear th'art mercifull .
Your hand Lady ; What a strange heat is here ! bring some warm water .
She shall use nothing that is yours ; my sorrowProvides her of a better bath , my tearsShall do that office .
O my best Arnoldo ! The truest of all lovers ! I would liveWere heaven so pleas 'd , but to reward your sorrowWith my true service ; but since that 's denied me , May you live long and happy : do not suffer ( By your affection to me I conjure you ) My sickness to infect you ; though much loveMakes you too subject to it .
In this only
wrongs her servant ; can the bodySubsist , the Soul departed ? 't is as easieAs I to live without you ; I am your husband , And long have been so , though our adverse fortune , Bandying us from one hazard to another , Would never grant me so much happiness , As to pay a husbands debt ; despite of fortune , In death I'le follow you , and guard mine own ; And there enjoy what here my fate forbids me .
So true a sorrow , and so feelinglyExprest , I never read of .
I am struckWith wonder to behold it , as with pity .
If you that are a stranger , suffer for them , Being tied no further than humanityLeads you to soft compassion ; think great Sir , What of necessity I must endure , That am a Father ? Hippolyta , Zabulon , and Sulpitia at the door .
Wait me there , I hold itUnfit to have you seen ; as I find cause , You shall proceed .
You are welcom Lady .
Sir , I come to do a charitable office , How does the patient ?
You may enquireOf more than one ; for two are sick , and deadly , He languishes in her , her health 's despair 'd of , And in hers , his .
'T is a strange spectacle , With what a patience they sit unmov 'd ! Are they not dead already ?
By her pulse , She can not last a day .
Oh by that summons , I know my time too !
Look to the man .
ApplyYour Art , to save the Lady , preserve her , A town is your reward .
I'le treble it , In ready gold , if you restore Arnoldo ; For in his death I dye too .
Without herI am no more .
Are you there Madam ? nowYou may feast on my miseries ; my coldnessIn answering your affections , or hardness , Give it what name you please , you are reveng 'd of , For now you may perceive , our thred of lifeWas spun together , and the poor ArnoldoMade only to enjoy the best Zenocia , And not to serve the use of any other ; And in that she may equal ; my Lord ClodioHad long since else enjoyed her , nor could IHave been so blind , as not to see your greatAnd many excellencies far , far beyondOr my deservings , or my hopes ; we are nowGoing our latest journey , and together , Our only comfort we desire , pray give it , Your charity to our ashes , such we must be , And not to curse our memories .
I am much mov 'd .
I am wholly overcome , all love to womenFarewell for ever ; ere you dye , your pardon ; And yours Sir ; had she many years to live , Perhaps I might look on her , as a Brother , But as a lover never ; and since allYour sad misfortunes had originalFrom the barbarous Custom practis 'd in my Country , Heaven witness , for your sake I here release it ; So to your memory , chaste Wives and VirginsShall ever pay their vowes. I give her to you ; And wish , she were so now , as when my lustForc 'd you to quit the Country .
It is in vainTo strive with destiny , here my dotage ends , Look up Zenocia , health in me speaks to you ; She gives him to you , that by divers ways , So long has kept him from you : and repent not , That you were once my servant , for which healthIn recompence of what I made you suffer , The hundred thousand Crowns , the City owes me , Shall be your dower .
'T is a magnificent gift , Had it been timely given .
It is believe it , Sulpitia .
Servant , and Sulpitia .
Madam .
Quick , undoe the charm ; Ask not a reason why ; let it suffice , It is my will .
Which I obey and gladly. [ Exit .
Is to be married , sayest thou ?
So she sayes Sir , And does desire your presence. [ They are born off in chairs .
And tell her I'le come .
Pray carry them to their rest ; for though already , They do appear as dead , let my life pay for't , If they recover not .
What you have warranted , Assure your self , will be expected from you ; Look to them carefully ; and till the tryal , --
Which shall not be above four hours .
Let meIntreat your companies : there is somethingOf weight invites me hence .
We 'll wait upon you. [ Exeunt .
Guiomar , and Servants .
You understand what my directions are , And what they guide you to ; the faithfull promiseYou have made me all .
We do and will perform it .
The Governour will not fail to be here presently ; Retire a while , till you shall find occasion , And bring me word , when they arrive .
Wee shall Madam .
Only stay you to entertain .
I am ready .
I wonder at the bold , and practis 'd malice , Men ever have o ' foot against our honours , That nothing we can do , never so vertuous , No shape put on so pious , no not thinkWhat a good is , be that good ne 're so noble , Never so laden with admir 'd example , But still we end in lust ; our aims , our actions , Nay , even our charities , with lust are branded ; Why should this stranger else , this wretched stranger , Whose life I sav 'd at what dear price sticks here yet , Why should he hope ? he was not here an hour , And certainly in that time , I may swear itI gave him no loose look , I had no reason ; Unless my tears were flames , my curses courtships ; The killing of my Son , a kindness to me.Why should he send to me , or with what safety ( Examining the ruine he had wrought me ) Though at that time , my pious pity found him , And my word fixt ; I am troubled , strongly troubled .
Servant .
The Gentlemen are come .
Then bid 'em welcome -- I must retire. [ Exit .
Rutilio , and Duarte .
You are welcom Gentlemen .
I thank you friend , I would speak with your Lady .
I'le let her understand .
It shall befit you.How do I look Sir , in this handsome trim ? [ Exit Servant.Me thinks I am wondrous brave .
You are very decent .
These by themselves , without more helps of nature , Would set a woman hard ; I know 'em all , And where their first aims light ; I'le lay my head o n't , I'le take her eye , as soon as she looks on me , And if I come to speak once , woe be to her , I have her in a nooze , she can not scape me ; I have their several lasts .
You are throughly studied , But tell me Sir , being unacquainted with her , As you confess you are --
That 's not an hours work , I'le make a Nun forget her beads in two hours .
She being set in years , next none of those lustersAppearing in her eye , that warm the fancy ; Nor nothing in her face , but handsom ruines .
I love old stories : those live believ 'd , Authentique , When 20. of your modern faces are call 'd in , For new opinion , paintings , and corruptions ; Give me an old confirm 'd face ; besides she sav 'd me , She sav 'd my life , have I not cause to love her ? She 's rich and of a constant state , a fair one , Have I not cause to wooe her ? I have tryed sufficientAll your young Phillies , I think this back has try 'd 'em , And smarted for it too : they run away with me , Take bitt between the teeth , and play the Devils ; A staied pace now becomes my years ; a sure one , Where I may sit and crack no girths .
How miserable , If my Mother should confirm , what I suspect now , Beyond all humane cure were my condition ! Then I shall wish , this body had been so too.Here comes the Lady Sir .
Guiomar .
Excellent Lady , To shew I am a creature , bound to your service , And only yours --
Keep at that distance Sir ; For if you stir --
I am obedient.She has found already , I am for her turn ; With what a greedy hawks eye she beholds me ! Mark how she musters all my parts .
A goodly Gentleman , Of a more manly set , I never look 'd on .
Mark , mark her eyes still ; mark but the carriage of 'em .
How happy am I now , since my Son fell , He fell not by a base unnoble hand ! As that still troubled me ; how far more happyShall my revenge be , since the Sacrifice , I offer to his grave , shall be both worthyA Sons untimely loss , and a Mothers sorrow !
Sir , I am made believe it ; she is mine own , I told you what a spell I carried with me , All this time does she spend in contemplationOf that unmatch 'd delight : I shall be thankfull to ye ; And if you please to know my house , to use it ; To take it for your own .
Who waits without there ?
Guard , and Servants , they seize upon Rut. and bind him .
How now ? what means this , Lady ?
Bind him fast .
Are these the bride-laces you prepare for me ? The colours that you give ?
Fye Gentle Lady , This is not noble dealing .
Be you satisfied , I [ t ] seems you are a stranger to this meaning , You shall not be so long .
Do you call this wooing -- Is there no end of womens persecutions ? Must I needs fool into mine own destruction ? Have I not had fair warnings , and enough too ? Still pick the Devils teeth ? you are not mad Lady ; Do I come fairly , and like a Gentleman , To offer you that honour ?
You are deceiv 'd Sir , You come besotted , to your own destruction : I sent not for you ; what honour can ye add to me , That brake that staff of honour , my age lean 'd on ? That rob 'd me of that right , made me a Mother ? Hear me thou wretched man , hear me with terrour , And let thine own bold folly shake thy Soul , Hear me pronounce thy death , that now hangs o 're thee , Thou desperate fool ; who bad thee seek this ruine ? What mad unmanly fate , made thee discoverThy cursed face to me again ? was't not enoughTo have the fair protection of my house , When misery and justice close pursued thee ? When thine own bloudy sword , cryed out against thee , Hatcht in the life of him ? yet I forgave thee.My hospitable word , even when I sawThe goodliest branch of all my blood lopt from me , Did I not seal still to thee ?
I am gone .
And when thou went'st , to Imp thy miserie , Did I not give thee means ? but hark ungratefull , Was it not thus ? to hide thy face and fly me ? To keep thy name for ever from my memory ? Thy cursed blood and kindred ? did I not swear then , If ever , ( in this wretched life thou hast left me , Short and unfortunate , ) I saw thee again , Or came but to the knowledge , where thou wandredst , To call my vow back , and pursue with vengeanceWith all the miseries a Mother suffers ?
I was born to be hang 'd , there 's no avoiding it .
And dar'st thou with this impudence appear here ? Walk like the winding sheet my Son was put in , Stand with those wounds ?
I am happy now again ; Happy the hour I fell , to find a Mother , So pious , good , and excellent in sorrows .
Servant .
The Governour 's come in .
O let him enter .
I have fool 'd my self a fair thred of all my fortunes , This strikes me most ; not that I fear to perish , But that this unmannerly boldness has brought me to it .
Governour , Clodio , Charino .
Are these fit preparations for a wedding Lady ? I came prepar 'd a guest .
O give me justice ; As ever you will leave a vertuous name , Do justice , justice , Sir .
You need not ask it , I am bound to it .
Justice upon this manThat kill 'd my Son .
Do you confess the act ?
Yes Sir .
Rutilio ?
'T is the same .
How fell he thus ? Here will be sorrow for the good Arnoldo .
Take heed Sir what you say .
I have weigh 'd it well , I am the man , nor is it life I start at ; Only I am unhappy I am poor , Poor in expence of lives , there I am wretched , That I have not two lives lent me for his sacrifice ; One for her Son , another for her sorrows.Excellent Lady , now rejoyce again , For though I can not think , y'are pleas 'd in blood , Nor with that greedy thirst pursue your vengeance ; The tenderness , even in those tears denies that ; Yet let the world believe , you lov 'd Duarte ; The unmatcht courtesies you have done my miseries ; Without this forfeit to the law , would charge meTo tender you this life , and proud 'twould please you .
Shall I have justice ?
Yes .
I'le ask it for ye , I'le follow it my self , against my self.Sir , 'T is most fit I dye ; dispatch it quickly , The monstrous burthen of that grief she labours withWill kill her else , then blood on blood lyes on me ; Had I a thousand lives , I 'd give 'em all , Before I would draw one tear more from that vertue .
Be not too cruel Sir , and yet his bold sword -- But his life can not restore that , he 's a man too -- Of a fair promise , but alas my Son 's dead ; If I have justice , must it kill him ?
Yes .
If I have not , it kills me , strong and goodly ! Why should he perish too ?
It lies in your power , You only may accuse him , or may quit him .
Be there no other witnesses ?
Not any.And if I save him , will not the world proclaim , I have forgot a Son , to save a murderer ? And yet he looks not like one , he looks manly .
Pity so brave a Gentleman should perish.She can not be so hard , so cruel hearted .
Will you pronounce ? yet stay a little Sir .
Rid your self , Lady , of this misery ; And let me go , I do but breed more tempests , With which you are already too much shaken .
Do now , pronounce ; I will not hear .
You shall not , Yet turn and see good Madam .
Do not wonder.'Tis he , restor 'd again , thank the good Doctor , Pray do not stand amaz 'd , it is Duarte ; Is well , is safe again .
O my sweet Son , I will not press my wonder now with questions -- Sir , I am sorry for that cruelty , I urg 'd against you .
Madam , it was but justice .
'T is [ t ] rue , the Doctor heal 'd this body again , But this man heal 'd my soul , made my minde perfect , The good sharp lessons his sword read to me , sav 'd me ; For which , if you lov 'd me , dear Mother , Honour and love this man .
You sent this letter ?
My boldness makes me blush now .
I'le wipe off that , And with this kiss , I take you for my husband , Your wooing 's done Sir ; I believe you love me , And that 's the wealth I look for now .
You have it .
You have ended my desire to all my wishes .
Now 't is a wedding again. And if HippolytaMake good , what with the hazard of her life , She undertook , the evening will set clear
Hippolyta , leading Leopold , Arnoldo , Zenocia , in either hand , Zabulon , Sulpitia.After a stormy day .
Here comes the Lady .
With fair Zenocia , Health with life againRestor 'd unto her .
The gift of her goodness .
Let us embrace , I am of your order too , And though I once despair 'd of women , nowI find they relish much of Scorpions , For both have stings , and both can hurt , and cure too ; But what have been your fortunes ?
Wee'l deferOur story , and at time more fit , relate it.Now all that reverence vertue , and in that
constancy , and perfect love , Or for her sake Arnoldo , join with usIn th ' honour of this Lady .
She deserves it .
Hippolytas life shall make that good hereafter , Nor will I alone better my self but others : For these whose wants perhaps have made their actionsNot altogether innocent , shall from meBe so supplied , that need shall not compel them , To any course of life , but what the lawShall give allowance to .
Sulpitia , Your Ladiships creatures .
Be so , and no more you man-huckster .
And worthy Leopold , you that with such fervour , So long have sought me , and in that deserv 'd me , Shall now find full reward for all your travels , Which you have made more dear by patient sufferance.And though my violent dotage did transport me , Beyond those bounds , my modesty should have kept in , Though my desires were loose , from unchast artHeaven knows I am free .
The thought of that 's dead to me ; I gladly take your offer .
Do so Sir , A piece of crackt gold ever will weigh downSilver that 's whole .
You shall be all my guests , I must not be denyed .

Phoebe , her Daughter .
Greece.The principal Actors were,
2 Ushers , and Grooms with perfumes .
Round , round , perfume it round , quick , look yeDiligently the state be right , are these the richestCushions ? Fie , fie , who waits i'th ' wardrobe ?
But pray tell me , do you think for certainThese Embassadours shall have this morning audience ?
They shall have it : Lord that you live at CourtAnd understand not ! I tell you they must have it .
Upon what necessity ?
Still you are out of the trick of Court , sell your place,
Ladies and Gentlemen.And sow your grounds , you are not for this tillage.Madams , the best way is the upper lodgings , There you may see at ease .
We thank you , Sir. [ Ex. Ladies , Gent .
Would you have all these slighted ? who should report then , The Embassadors were handsome men ? his beardA neat one ? the fire of his eyes quicker than lightning , And when it breaks , as blasting ? his legs , though little ones , Yet movers of a mass of understanding ? Who shall commend their Cloaths ? who shall take noticeOf the most wise behaviour of their Feathers ? Ye live a raw man here .
I think I do so .
Why , whither would ye all press ?
Good Master Usher .
My wife , and some few of my honest neighbours , here .
Prethee begone thou and thy honest Neighbours , Thou lookst like an Ass , why , whither would you fish face ?
If I might haveBut the honour to see you at my poor house , Sir , A Capon bridled and sadled , I'le assure your worship , A shoulder of Mutton and a pottle of Wine , Sir , I know your Brother , he was like ye , And shot the best at Buts --
A -- -- upon thee .
Some Musick I'le assure you too , My toy , Sir , can play o'th ' Virginals .
Prethee good toy , Take away thy shoulder of Mutton , it is flie-blown , And shoulder take thy flap along , here 's no place for ye ; Nay then you had best be knock'd. [ Ex. Cit .
Celia .
I wou 'd fain see him , The glory of this place makes me remember , But dye those thoughts , dye all but my desires , Even those to death are sick too ; he 's not here , Nor how my eyes may guide me --
What 's your business ? Who keeps the outward door there ? here 's fine shuffling , You wastcoateer you must go back .
There is not , There can not be , six days and never see me ? There must not be desire ; Sir , do you thinkThat if you had a Mistris --
Death , she is mad .
And were yourself an honest man ? it can not --
What a Devil hast thou to do with me or my honesty ? Will you be jogging , good nimble tongue , My fellow door-keeper .
Prethee let her alone,
The King is coming , And shall we have an agent from the SuburbsCome to crave audience too ?
Before I thought yeTo have a little breeding , some tang of Gentry ; But now I take ye plainly , Without the help of any perspective , For that ye can not alter .
What 's that ?
An Ass , Sir , you bray as like one , And by my troth , me thinks as ye stand now , Considering who to kick next , you appear to meJust with that kind of gravity , and wisdom ; Your place may bear the name of Gentleman , But if ever any of that butter stick to your bread --
You must be modester .
Let him use me nobler , And wear good Cloaths to do good Offices ; They hang upon a fellow of his vertue , As though they hung on Gibbets .
A perillous wench .
Thrust her into a corner , I'le no more on her .
You have enough , go pretty Maid , stand close , And use that little tongue , with a little more temper .
I thank ye , Sir .
When the show 's past , I'le have ye into the Cellar , there we 'll dine.A very pretty wench , a witty Rogue , And there we 'll be as merry ; can ye be merry ?
O very merry .
Only our selves ; this churlish fellow shall not know .
By no means .
And can you love a little ?
Love exceedingly : I have cause to love you , dear Sir .
Then I'le carry ye , And shew you all the pictures , and the hangings , The Lodgings , Gardens , and the walks : and then , sweet , You shall tell me where you lye .
Yes marry will I .
And't shall go hard but I'le send ye a Venison Pasty , And bring a bottle of wine along .
Make room there,
Room there afore ; stand close , the train is coming .
Antigonus , Timon , Charinthus , Menippus .
Have I yet left a beauty to catch fools ? Yet , yet , I see him not. O what a miseryIs love , expected long , deluded longer !
Conduct in the Embassadors .
Make room there .
They shall not wait long answer -- [ Flourish .
Yet he comes not .
3 Embassadors.Why are eyes set on these , and multitudesFollow to make these wonders ? O good gods ! What would these look like if my love were here ? But I am fond , forgetful .
Now your grievance , Speak short , and have as short dispatch .
Then thus , Sir : In all our Royal Masters names , We tell you , Ye have done injustice , broke the bonds of concord , And from their equal shares , from AlexanderParted , and so possess 'd , not like a Brother , But as an open Enemy , Ye have hedged inWhole Provinces , man 'd and maintain 'd these injuries ; And daily with your sword ( though they still honour ye ) Make bloudy inroads , take Towns , and ruin Castles , And still their sufFerance feels the weight .
Think of that love , great Sir , that honor 'd friendshipYour self held with our Masters , think of that strengthWhen you were all one body , all one mind ; When all your swords struck one way , when your angers , Like so many brother Billows rose together , And curling up your foaming Crests , defiedEven mighty Kings , and in their falls entomb 'd 'em ; O think of these ; and you that have been Conquerours , That ever led your Fortunes open ey 'd , Chain 'd fast by confidence ; you that fame courted , Now ye want Enemies and men to match ye , Let not your own Swords seek your ends to shame ye .
Demetrius with a Javelin , and Gentlemen .
Choose which you will , or Peace or War , We come prepar 'd for either .
Room for the Prince there .
Was it the Prince they said ? how my heart trembled ! 'T is he indeed ; what a sweet noble fiercenessDwells in his eyes ! young Meleager like , When he return 'd from slaughter of the Boar , Crown 'd with the loves and honours of the people , With all the gallant youth of Greece , he looks now , Who could deny him love ?
Hail Royal Father .
Ye are welcome from your sport , Sir , do you see this Gent.You that bring Thunders in your mouths , and EarthquakesTo shake and totter my designs ? can you imagine ( You men of poor and common apprehensions ) While I admit this man , my Son , this natureThat in one look carries more fire , and fierceness , Than all your Masters in their lives ; dare I admit him , Admit him thus , even to my side , my bosom , When he is fit to rule , when all men cry him , And all hopes hang about his head ; thus place him , His weapon hatched in bloud , all these attendingWhen he shall make their fortunes , all as suddenIn any expedition he shall point 'em , As arrows from a Tartars bow , and speeding , Dare I do this , and fear an enemy ? Fear your great Master ? yours ? or yours ?
O Hercules ! Who saies you do , Sir ? Is there any thingIn these mens faces , or their Masters actions , Able to work such wonders ?
Now he speaks : O I could dwell upon that tongue for ever .
You call 'em Kings , they never wore those Royalties , Nor in the progress of their lives arriv 'd yetAt any thought of King : Imperial dignities , And powerful God-like actions , fit for PrincesThey can no more put on , and make 'em sit right , Than I can with this mortal hand hold Heaven : Poor petty men , nor have I yet forgotThe chiefest honours time , and merit gave 'em:
your Master , at the best , His highest , and his hopeful'st DignitiesWas but grand-master of the Elephants ;
of the Treasure ; and for Ptolomey , A thing not thought on then , scarce heard of yet , Some Master of Ammunition : and must these men --
What a brave confidence flows from his spirit ! O sweet young man !
Must these , hold pace with us , And on the same file hang their memories ? Must these examine what the wills of Kings are ? Prescribe to their designs , and chain their actionsTo their restraints ? be friends , and foes when they please ? Send out their Thunders , and their menaces , As if the fate of mortal things were theirs ? Go home good men , and tell your Masters from us , We do 'em too much honour to force from 'emTheir barren Countries , ruin their vast Cities , And tell 'em out of love , we mean to leave 'em ( Since they will needs be Kings ) no more to tread on , Than they have able wits , and powers to manage , And so we shall befriend 'em. Ha ! what does she there ?
This is your answer King ?
'T is like to prove so .
Fie , sweet , what makes you here ?
Pray ye do not chide me .
You do your self much wrong and me.I feel my fault which only was committedThrough my dear love to you : I have not seen ye , And how can I live then ? I have not spoke to ye --
I know this week ye have not ; I will redeem all.You are so tender now ; think where you are , sweet .
What other light have I left ?
Prethee Celia , Indeed I'le see you presently .
I have done , Sir : You will not miss ?
By this , and this , I will not .
'T is in your will and I must be obedient .
No more of these assemblies .
I am commanded .
Room for the Lady there : Madam , my service --
My Coach a n't please you Lady .
Room before there .
The honour , Madam , but to wait upon you -- My servants and my state .
Lord , how they flock now ! Before I was afraid they would have beat me ; How these flies play i'th ' Sun-shine ! pray ye no services , Or if ye needs must play the Hobby-horses , Seek out some beauty that affects 'em : farewel , Nay pray ye spare : Gentlemen I am old enoughTo go alone at these years , without crutches. [ Exit .
Well I could curse now : but that will not help me , I made as sure account of this wench now , immediately , Do but consider how the Devil has crost me , Meat for my Master she cries , well --
Once more , Sir , We ask your resolutions : Peace or War yet ?
War , War , my noble Father .
Thus I fling it : And fair ey 'd peace , farewel .
You have your answer ; Conduct out the Embassadours , and give 'em Convoyes .
Tell your high hearted Masters , they shall not seek us , Nor cool i'th ' field in expectation of us , We'l ease your men those marches : In their strengths , And full abilities of mind and courage , We'l find 'em out , and at their best trim buckle with 'em .
You will find so hot a Souldier 's welcome , Sir , Your favour shall not freeze .
A forward Gentleman , Pity the Wars should bruise such hopes --
Conduct em -- [ Ex. Em.Now , for this preparation : where 's Leontius ? Call him in presently : for I mean in person GentlemenMy self , with my old fortune --
Royal Sir : Thus low I beg this honour : fame alreadyHath every where rais 'd Trophies to your glory , And conquest now grown old , and weak with followingThe weary marches and the bloody shocksYou daily set her in : 't is now scarce honourFor you that never knew to fight , but conquer , To sparkle such poor people : the Royal EagleWhen she hath tri 'd [ h ] er young ones 'gainst the Sun , And found 'em right ; next teacheth 'em to prey , How to command on wing , and check below herEven Birds of noble plume ; I am your own , Sir , You have found my spirit , try it now , and teach itTo stoop whole Kingdoms : leave a little for me : Let not your glory be so greedy , Sir , To eat up all my hopes ; you gave me life , If to that life you add not what 's more lastingA noble name , for man , you have made a shadow : Bless me this day : bid me go on , and lead , Bid me go on , no less fear 'd , than Antigonus , And to my maiden sword , tye fast your fortune : I know 'twill fight it self then : dear Sir , honour me : Never fair Virgin long 'd so .
Rise , and command then , And be as fortunate , as I expect ye : I love that noble will ; your young companionsBred up and foster 'd with ye , I hope Demetrius , You will make souldiers too : they must not leave ye .
Leontius .
Never till life leave us , Sir .
O Leontius , Here 's work for you in hand .
I am ev'n right glad , Sir.For by my troth , I am now grown old with idleness ; I hear we shall abroad , Sir .
Yes , and presently , But who think you commands now ?
Who commands , Sir ? Methinks mine eye should guide me : can there be ( If you your self will spare him so much honour ) Any found out to lead before your Armies , So full of faith , and fire , as brave Demetrius ? King Philips Son , at his years was an old Souldier , 'T is time his Fortune be o ' wing , high time , Sir , So many idle hours , as here he loyters , So many ever-living names he loses , I hope 't is he .
'T is he indeed , and noblyHe shall set forward : draw you all those GarrisonsUpon the frontiers as you pass : to thoseJoyn these in pay at home , our ancient souldiers , And as you go press all the Provinces .
We shall not [ need ] ; Believe , this hopefull GentlemanCan want no swords , nor honest hearts to follow him , We shall be full , no fear Sir .
You Leontius , Because you are an old and faithfull servant , And know the wars , with all his vantages , Be near to his instructions , lest his youthLose valours best companion , staid discretion , Shew where to lead , to lodge , to charge with safetie ; In execution not to break , nor scatter , But with a provident anger , follow nobly : Not covetous of blood , and death , but honour , Be ever near his watches ; cheer his labours , And where his hope stands fair , provoke his valour ; Love him , and think it no dishonour ( my Demetrius ) To wear this Jewel near thee ; he is a tri 'd one , And one that even in spight of time , that sunk him , And frosted up his strength , will yet stand by thee , And with the proudest of thine EnemiesExchange for bloud , and bravely : take his Counsel .
Your grace hath made me young again , and wanton .
She must be known and suddenly : Do ye know her ? [ to Minippus .
No , believe Sir .
Did you observe her , Timon ?
I look 'd on her , But what she is --
I must have that found.Come in and take your leave .
And some few Prayers along .
I know my duty , [ Exit Ant.You shall be half my Father .
All your Servant : Come Gentlemen , you are resolv 'd I am sureTo see these wars .
We dare not leave his fortunes , Though most assur 'd death hung round about us .
= That bargain 's yet to make ; Be not too hasty , when ye face the Enemie , Nor too ambitious to get honour instantly , But charge within your bounds , and keep close bodies , And you shall see what sport we'l make these mad-caps ; You shall have game enough , I warrant ye , Every mans Cock shall fight .
I must go see Sir : Brave Sir , as soon as I have taken leave , I'le meet you in the park ; Draw the men thither , Wait you upon Leontius .
We'l attend Sir .
But I beseech your Grace , with speed ; the soonerWe are i'th ' field. --
You could not please me better. [ Exit .
You never saw the wars yet ?
Not yet Colonel .
These foolish Mistresses do so hang about ye , So whimper , and so hug , I know it Gentlemen , And so intice ye , now ye are i'th ' bud ; And that sweet tilting war , with eyes and kisses , Th ' alarms of soft vows , and sighs , and fiddle faddles , Spoils all our trade : you must forget these knick knacks , A woman at some time of year , I grant yeShe is necessarie ; but make no business of her.How now Lieutenant ?
Lieutenant .
Oh Sir , as ill as ever ; We shall have wars they say ; they are mustring yonder : Would we were at it once : fie , how it plagues me .
Here 's one has served now under Captain Cupid , And crackt a Pike in 's youth : you see what 's come o n't .
No , my disease will never prove so honourable .
Why sure , thou hast the best pox .
If I have 'em , I am sure I got 'em in the best company ; They are pox of thirty Coats .
Thou hast mewed 'em finely : Here 's a strange fellow now , and a brave fellow , If we may say so of a pocky fellow , ( Which I believe we may ) this poor Lieutenant ; Whether he have the scratches , or the scabs , Or what a Devil it be , I'le say this for him , There fights no braver souldier under Sun , Gentlemen ; Show him an Enemie , his pain 's forgot straight ; And where other men by beds and bathes have ease , And easie rules of Physick ; set him in a danger , A danger , that 's a fearfull one indeed , Ye rock him , and he will so play about ye , Let it be ten to one he ne'er comes off again , Ye have his heart : and then he works it bravely , And throughly bravely : not a pang remembre 'd : I have seen him do such things , belief would shrink at .
'T is strange he should do all this , and diseas 'd so .
I am sure 't is true : Lieutenant , canst thou drink well ?
Would I were drunk , dog-drunk , I might not feel this backward ?
I would take Physick .
But I would know my disease first .
Why ? it may be the Colique : canst thou blow
There 's never a bag-pipe in the Kingdom better .
Is't not a pleuresie ?
'T is any thingThat has the Devil , and death i n't : will ye march Gentlemen ? The Prince has taken leave .
How know ye that ?
I saw him leave the Court , dispatch his followers , And met him after in a by street : I thinkHe has some wench , or such a toy , to lick overBefore he go : would I had such anotherTo draw this foolish pain down .
Let 's away Gentlemen , For sure the Prince will stay on us .
We'l attend Sir. [ Exeunt .
Demetrius , and Celia .
Must ye needs go ?
Or stay with all dishonour .
Are there not men enough to fight ?
Fie Celia.This ill becomes the noble love you bear me ; Would you have your love a coward ?
No ; believe Sir , I would have him fight , but not so far off from me .
Wouldst have it thus ? or thus ?
If that be fighting --
Ye wanton fool : when I come home againI'le fight with thee , at thine own weapon Celia , And conquer thee too .
That you have done already , You need no other Arms to me , but these Sir ; But will you fight your self Sir ?
Thus deep in bloud wench , And through the thickest ranks of Pikes .
Spur bravelyYour firie Courser , beat the troops before ye , And cramb the mouth of death with executions .
I would do more than these : But prethee tell me , Tell me my fair , where got'st thou this male Spirit ? I wonder at thy mind .
Were I a man then , You would wonder more .
Sure thou wouldst prove a Souldier , And some great Leader .
Sure I should do somewhat ; And the first thing I did , I should grow envious , Extreamly envious of your youth , and honour .
And fight against me ?
Ten to one , I should do it .
Thou wouldst not hurt me ?
In this mind I am inI think I should be hardly brought to strike ye , Unless 'twere thus ; but in my mans mind --
What ?
I should be friends with you too , Now I think better .
Ye are a tall Souldier : Here , take these , and these ; This gold to furnish ye , and keep this bracelet ; Why do you weep now ? You a masculine Spirit ?
No , I confess , I am a fool , a woman : And ever when I part with you --
You shall not , These tears are like prodigious signs , my sweet one , I shall come back , loaden with fame , to honour thee .
I hope you shall : But then my dear Demetrius , When you stand Conquerour , and at your mercyAll people bow , and all things wait your sentence ; Say then your eye ( surveying all your conquest ) Finds out a beautie , even in sorrow excellent , A constant face , that in the midst of ruineWith a forc 'd smile , both scorns at fate , and fortune : Say you find such a one , so nobly fortified , And in her figure all the sweets of nature ?
Prethee , No more of this , I can not find her .
That shews as far beyond my wither 'd beauty ; And will run mad to love ye too .
Do you fear me , And do you think , besides this face , this beauty , This heart , where all my hopes are lock 'd --
I dare not : No sure , I think ye honest ; wondrous honest.Pray do not frown , I'le swear ye are .
Ye may choose .
But how long will ye be away ?
I know not .
I know you are angry now : pray look upon me : I'le ask no more such questions .
The Drums beat , I can no longer stay .
They do but call yet : How fain you would leave my Company ?
I wou 'd not , Unless a greater power than love commanded , Commands my life , mine honour .
But a little .
Prethee farewel , and be not doubtfull of me .
I would not have ye hurt : and ye are so ventrous -- But good sweet Prince preserve your self , fight nobly , But do not thrust this body , 't is not yours now , 'T is mine , 't is only mine : do not seek wounds , Sir , For every drop of blood you bleed --
I will Celia , I will be carefull .
My heart , that loves ye dearly .
Prethee no more , we must part : [ Drums a March.Hark , they march now .
Pox on these bawling Drums : I am sure you'l kiss me , But one kiss ? what a parting 's this ?
Here take me , And do what thou wilt with me , smother me ; But still remember , if your fooling with me , Make me forget the trust --
I have done : farewel Sir , Never look back , you shall not stay , not a minute .
I must have one farewel more .
No , the Drums beat ; I dare not slack your honour ; not a hand more , Only this look ; the gods preserve , and save ye .
Antigonus , Carinthus , Timon .
What , have ye found her out ?
We have hearkned after her .
What 's that to my desire ?
Your grace must give us time , And a little means .
She is sure a stranger , If she were bred or known here --
Your dull endeavours Enter Menippus.Should never be employ'd. Welcom Menippus .
I have found her Sir , I mean the place she is lodg 'd in ; her name is Celia , And much adoe I had to purchase that too .
Dost think Demetrius loves her ?
Much I fear it , But nothing that way yet can win for certain.I'le tell your grace within this hour .
A stranger ?
Without all doubt .
But how should he come to her ?
There lies the marrow of the matter hid yet .
Hast thou been with thy wife ?
No Sir , I am going to her .
Go and dispatch , and meet me in the garden , And get all out ye can. [ Exit .
I'le doe my best Sir. [ Exit .
Blest be thy wife , thou wert an arrant ass else .
I , she is a stirring woman indeed : There 's a brain Brother .
Drum within , Alarm , Enter Demetrius , and Leontius .
I will not see 'em fall thus , give me way Sir , I shall forget you love me else .
Will ye lose all ? For me to be forgotten , to be hated , Nay never to have been a man , is nothing , So you , and those we have preserv 'd from slaughterCome safely off .
I have lost my self .
You are cozen 'd .
And am most miserable .
There 's no man so , but he that makes himself so .
I will goe on .
You must not : I shall tell you then , And tell you true , that man 's unfit to govern , That can not guide himself : you lead an Army ? That have not so much manly suff'rance left ye , To bear a loss ?
Charge but once more Leontius , My friends and my companions are engag 'd all .
Nay give 'em lost , I saw 'em off their horses , And the enemy master of their Arms ; nor could thenThe policie , nor strength of man redeem 'em .
And shall I know this , and stand fooling ?
By my dead Fathers soul you stir not , Sir , Or if you doe , you make your way through me first .
Thou art a Coward .
To prevent a Madman.None but your Fathers Son , durst call me so , 'Death if he did -- Must I be scandal 'd by ye , That hedg 'd in all the helps I had to save ye ? That , where there was a valiant weapon stirring , Both search 'd it out , and singl 'd it , unedg 'd it , For fear it should bite you , am I a coward ? Go , get ye up , and tell 'em ye are the Kings Son ; Hang all your Ladys favours on your Crest , And let them fight their shares ; spur to destruction , You can not miss the way : be bravely desperate , And your young friends before ye , that lost this battel , Your honourable friends , that knew no order , Cry out , Antigonus , the old Antigonus , The wise and fortunate Antigonus , The great , the valiant , and the fear 'd Antigonus , Has sent a desperate son , without discretionTo bury in an hour his age of honour .
I am ashamed .
'T is ten to one , I die with ye : The coward will not long be after ye ; I scorn to say I saw you fall , sigh for ye , And tell a whining tale , some ten years afterTo boyes and girles in an old chimney corner , Of what a Prince we had , how bravely spirited ; How young and fair he fell : we'l all go with ye , And ye shall see us all , like sacrificesIn our best trim , fill up the mouth of ruine.Will this faith satisfie your folly ? can this show ye'Tis not to die we fear , but to die poorly , To fall , forgotten , in a multitude ? If you will needs tempt fortune now she has held ye , Held ye from sinking up .
Pray do not kill me , These words pierce deeper than the wounds I suffer , The smarting wounds of loss .
Ye are too tender ; Fortune has hours of loss , and hours of honour , And the most valiant feel them both : take comfort , The next is ours , I have a soul descries it : The angry bull never goes back for breathBut when he means to arm his fury double.Let this day set , but not the memorie , And we shall find a time : How now Lieutenant ?
Lieutenant .
I know not : I am mall 'd : we are bravely beaten , All our young gallants lost .
Thou art hurt .
I am pepper 'd , I was i'th ' midst of all : and bang 'd of all hands : They made an anvile of my head , it rings yet ; Never so thresh 'd : do you call this fame ? I have fam 'd it ; I have got immortal fame , but I'le no more o n't ; I'le no such scratching Saint to serve hereafter ; O ' my conscience I was kill 'd above twenty times , And yet I know not what a Devil 's i n't , I crawled away , and lived again still ; I am hurt plaguily , But now I have nothing near so much pain Colonel , They have sliced me for that maladie .
All the young men lost ?
I am glad you are here : but they are all i'th ' pound sir , They'l never ride o 're other mens corn again , I take it , Such frisking , and such flaunting with their feathers , And such careering with their Mistres favours ; And here must he be pricking out for honour , And there got he a knock , and down goes pilgarlick , Commends his soul to his she-saint , and Exit.Another spurs in there , cryes make room villains , I am a Lord , scarce spoken , but with reverenceA Rascal takes him o 're the face , and fells him ; There lyes the Lord , the Lord be with him .
Now Sir , Do you find this truth ?
I would not .
Pox upon it , They have such tender bodies too ; such Culisses , That one good handsom blow breaks 'em a pieces .
How stands the Enemy ?
Even cool enough too : For to say truth he has been shrewdly heated , The Gentleman no doubt will fall to his jewlips .
He marches not i'th ' tail on 's .
No , plague take him , He'l kiss our tails as soon ; he looks upon us , As if he would say , if ye will turn again , friends , We will belabor you a little better , And beat a little more care into your coxcombs.Now shall we have damnable Ballads out against us , Most wicked madrigals : and ten to one , Colonel , Sung to such lowsie , lamentable tunes .
Thou art merry , How e 're the game goes : good Sir be not troubled , A better day will draw this back again.Pray go , and cheer those left , and lead 'em off , They are hot , and weary .
I'le doe any thing .
Lieutenant , send one presently awayTo th ' King , and let him know our state : and hark ye , Be sure the messenger advise his MajestieTo comfort up the Prince : he 's full of sadness .
When shall I get a Surgeon ? this hot weather , Unless I be well pepper 'd , I shall stink , Colonel .
Go , I'le prepare thee one .
If ye catch me then , Fighting again , I'le eat hay with a horse. [ Exit .

I have wrought her .
You know for whom she is ?
Very well , Madam , Though very much ado I had to make herApprehend that happiness .
These Kind are subtile ; Did she not cry and blubber when you urg 'd her ?
O most extreamly , and swore she would rather perish .
Good signs , very good signs , Symptoms of easie nature.Had she the Plate ?
She lookt upo n't , and left it , And turn 'd again , and view 'd it .

A delicate , and knows it ; And out of that proof arms her self .
Come in then ; I have a great design from the King to you , And you must work like wax now .
On this Lady ?
On this , and all your wits call home .

As we go in , I'le tell ye. [ Exeunt .
Antigonus , Timon , Lords and a Souldier .
No face of sorrow for this loss , 'twill choak him , Nor no man miss a friend , I know his natureSo deep imprest with grief , for what he has suffer 'd , That the least adding to it adds to his ruine ; His loss is not so infinite , I hope , Souldier .
Faith neither great , nor out of indiscretion.The young men out of heat .
Demetrius , Leontius , and Lieutenant .
I guess the manner .
The Prince and't like your Grace .
You are welcome home , Sir : Come , no more sorrow , I have heard your fortune , And I my self have try 'd the like : clear up man , I will not have ye take it thus ; if I doubtedYour fear had lost , and that you had turn 'd your back to 'em , Basely besought their mercies --
No , no , by this hand , Sir , We fought like honest and tall men .
I know't Leontius : or if I thoughtNeglect of rule , having his counsel with ye , Or too vain-glorious appetite of Fame , Your men forgot and scatter 'd .
None of these , Sir , He shew 'd himself a noble Gentleman , Every way apt to rule .
These being granted ; Why should you think you have done an act so hainous , That nought but discontent dwells round about ye ? I have lost a Battel .
I , and fought it hard too .
With as much means as man --
Or Devil could urge it .
Twenty to one of our side now .
Turn Tables , Beaten like Dogs again , like Owls , you take itTo heart for flying but a mile before 'em ; And to say the truth , 't was no flight neither , Sir , 'T was but a walk , a handsome walk , I have tumbl 'd with this old Body , beaten like a Stock-fish , And stuck with Arrows , like an arming Quiver , Blouded and bang 'd almost a day before 'em , And glad I have got off then. Here 's a mad Shaver , He fights his share I am sure , when e'r he comes to't ; Yet I have seen him trip it tithly too , And cry the Devil take the hindmost ever .
I learnt it of my Betters .
Boudge at this ?
Has Fortune but one Face ?
In her best VizardMethinks she looks but lowzily .
Chance , though she faint now , And sink below our expectations , Is there no hope left strong enough to buoy her ?
'T is not , this day I fled before the Enemy , And lost my People , left mine Honour murder 'd , My maiden Honour , never to be ransom 'd , ( Which to a noble Soul is too too sensible ) Afflicts me with this sadness ; most of these , Time may turn straight again , experience perfect , And new Swords cut new ways to nobler Fortunes.O I have lost --
As you are mine forget it : I do not think it loss .
O Sir , forgive me , I have lost my friends , those worthy Souls bred with me , I have lost my self , they were the pieces of me : I have lost all Arts , my Schools are taken from me , Honour and Arms , no emulation left me : I liv 'd to see these men lost , look 'd upon it : These men that twin 'd their loves to mine , their vertues ; O shame of shames ! I saw and could not save 'em , This carries Sulphur i n't , this burns , and boils me , And like a fatal Tomb , bestrides my memory .
This was hard fortune , but if alive , and taken , They shall be ransom 'd : let it be at Millions .
They are dead , they are dead .
When wou 'd he weep for me thus ? I may be dead and powder 'd .
Good Prince , grieve not : We are not certain of their deaths : the Enemy , Though he be hot , and keen , Yet holds good Quarter.What Noise is this ? [ Great Shout within : Enter Gentlemen .
He does not follow us ? Give me a Steeple top .
They live , they live , Sir .
Hold up your manly face.They live , they are here , Son .
These are the men .
They are , and live to honour ye .
How 'scap 'd ye noble friends ? methought I saw yeEven in the Jaws of Death .
Thanks to our folly , That spur 'd us on ; we were indeed hedg 'd round i n't ; And ev'n beyond the hand of succour , beaten , Unhors 'd , disarm 'd : and what we lookt for then , Sir , Let such poor weary Souls that hear the Bell knoll , And see the Grave a digging , tell .
For Heavens sakeDelude mine Eyes no longer ! how came ye off ?
Against all expectation , the brave Seleucus , I think this day enamour 'd on your Vertue , When , through the Troops , he saw ye shoot like lightning ; And at your manly courage all took fire ; And after that , the misery we fell toThe never-certain Fate of War , considering , As we stood all before him , Fortunes ruines , Nothing but Death expecting , a short timeHe made a stand upon our Youths and Fortunes.Then with an eye of mercy inform 'd his Judgment , How yet unripe we were , unblown , unharden 'd , Unfitted for such fatal ends ; he cryed out to us , Go Gentlemen , commend me to your Master , To the most High , and Hopeful Prince , Demetrius ; Tell him the Valour that he showed against meThis day , the Virgin Valour , and true fire , Deserves even from an Enemy this courtesie ; Your Lives , and Arms freely. I 'll give 'em : thank him.And thus we are return 'd , Sir .
Faith , 't was well done ; 'T was bravely done ; was't not a noble part , Sir ?
Had I been there , up had I gone , I am sure o n't ; These noble tricks I never durst trust 'em yet .
Let me not live , and't were not a famed honesty ; It takes me such a tickling way : now would I wish Heaven , But e'n the happiness , e'n that poor blessingFor all the sharp afflictions thou hast sent me , But e'n i'th ' head o'th ' field , to take Seleucus.I should do something memorable : fie , sad still ?
Do you grieve , we are come off ?
Unransom 'd , was it ?
It was , Sir .
And with such a fame to me ? Said ye not so ?
Ye have heard it .
O Leontius ! Better I had lost 'em all : my self had perish 'd , And all my Fathers hopes .
Mercy upon you ; What ails you , Sir ? Death , do not make fools on 's , Neither go to Church , nor tarry at home , That 's a fine Horn-pipe ?
What 's now your grief , Demetrius ?
Did he not beat us twice ?
He beat , a Pudding ; Beat us but once .
H'as beat me twice , and beat me to a Coward.Beat me to nothing .
Is not the Devil in him ?
I pray it be no worse .
Twice conquer 'd me .
Bear witness all the world , I am a Dunce here .
With valour first he struck me , then with honour , That stroak Leontius , that stroak , dost thou not feel it ?
Whereabouts was it ? for I remember nothing yet .
All these GentlemenThat were his Prisoners --
Yes , he set 'em free , Sir , With Arms and honour .
There , there , now thou hast it ; At mine own weapon , Courtesie has beaten me , At that I was held a Master in , he has cow 'd me , Hotter than all the dint o'th ' Fight he has charg 'd me : Am I not now a wretched fellow ? think o n't ; And when thou hast examin 'd all wayes honorable , And find'st no door left open to requite this , Conclude I am a wretch , and was twice beaten .
I have observ 'd your way , and understand it , And equal love it as Demetrius , My noble child thou shalt not fall in vertue , I and my power will sink first : you Leontius , Wait for a new Commission , ye shall out again , And instantly : you shall not lodge this night here , Not see a friend , nor take a blessing with ye , Before ye be i'th ' field : the enemy is up still , And still in full design : Charge him again , Son , And either bring home that again thou hast lost there , Or leave thy body by him .
Ye raise me , And now I dare look up again , Leontius .
I , I , Sir , I am thinking who we shall take of 'em , To make all straight ; and who we shall give to th ' Devil.What saist thou now Lieutenant ?
I say nothing.Lord what ail I , that I have no mind to fight now ? I find my constitution mightily alter'dSince I came home : I hate all noises too , Especially the noise of Drums ; I am now as wellAs any living man ; why not as valiant ? To fight now , is a kind of vomit to me , It goes against my stomach .
Good Sir , presently ; You can not doe your Son so fair a favour .
'T is my intent : I'le see ye march away too.Come , get your men together presently , Leontius , And press where please you , as you march .
We goe Sir .
Wait you on me , I'le bring ye to your command , And then to fortune give you up .
Ye love me. [ Exit .
Goe , get the Drums , beat round , Lieutenant .
Hark ye , Sir , I have a foolish business they call marriage .
After the wars are done .
The partie staies Sir , I have giv'n the Priest his mony too : all my friends Sir , My Father , and my Mother .
Will you goe forward ?
She brings a pretty matter with her .
Half a dozen Bastards .
Some fortie Sir .
A goodly competency .
I mean Sir , pounds a year ; I'le dispatch the matter , 'T is but a night or two ; I'le overtake ye Sir .
The 2 old legions , yes : where lies the horse-quarter ?
And if it be a boy , I'le even make bold Sir .
Away with your whore , A plague o ' your whore , you damn 'd Rogue , Now ye are cur 'd and well ; must ye be clicketing ?
I have broke my mind to my Ancient , in my absence , He 's a sufficient Gentleman .
Get forward .
Only receive her portion .
Get ye forward ; Else I'le bang ye forward .
Strange Sir , A Gentleman and an officer can not have the libertyTo doe the office of a man .
Shame light on thee , How came this whore into thy head ?
This whore Sir ? 'T is strange , a poor whore .
Do not answer me , Troop , Troop away ; do not name this whore again , Or think there is a whore .
That 's very hard Sir .
For if thou dost , look to't , I'le have thee guelded , I'le walk ye out before me : not a word more. [ Exeunt .
Leucippe , and Governess .
Ye are the Mistris of the house ye say , Where this young Lady lies .
For want of a better .
You may be good enough for such a purpose : When was the Prince with her ? answer me directly .
Not since he went a warring .
Very well then : What carnal copulation are you privie toBetween these two ? be not afraid , we are women , And may talk thus amongst our selves , no harm i n't .
No sure , there 's no harm i n't , I conceive that ; But truly , that I ever knew the GentlewomanOtherwise given , than a hopefull Gentlewoman --
You'l grant me the Prince loves her ?
There I am with ye.And the gods bless her , promises her mightily .
Stay there a while. And gives her gifts ?
Extreamly ; And truly makes a very Saint of her .
I should think now , ( Good woman let me have your judgement with me , I see 't is none of the worst : Come sit down by me ) That these two can not love so tenderly .
Being so young as they are too .
You say well -- But that methinks some further promises --
Yes , yes , I have heard the Prince swear he would marry her .
Very well still : they do not use to fall out ?
The tenderest Chickens to one another , They can not live an hour asunder .
I have done then ; And be you gone ; you know your charge , and do it.You know whose will it is ; if you transgress it -- That is , if any have access , or see her , Before the Kings will be fulfill 'd --
Not the Prince , Madam ?
You'I be hang 'd if you doe it , that I'le assure ye .
But ne'retheless , I'le make bold to obey ye .
Away , and to your business then .
'T is done , Madam. [ Exeunt .
Antigonus , and Menippus .
Thou hast taken wondrous pains ; but yet Menippus , You understand not of what bloud and country .
I labour 'd that , but can not come to know it.A Greek I am sure she is , she speaks this language .
Is she so excellent handsom ?
Most inticing .
Sold for a prisoner ?
Yes Sir , Some poor creature .
And he loves tenderly ?
They say extreamly .
'T is well prevented then : yes , I perceiv 'd it : When he took leave now , he made a hundred stops , Desir 'd an hour , but half an hour , a minute , Which I with anger cross 'd ; I knew his business , I knew 't was she he hunted on ; this journey , man , I beat out suddenly for her cause intended , And would not give him time to breath. When comes she ?
This morning Sir .
Lodge her to all delight then : For I would have her try 'd to th ' test : I know , She must be some crackt coyn , not fit his traffique , ( her , Which when we have found , the shame will make him leaveOr we shall work a nearer way : I'le bury him , And with him all the hopes I have cast upon him , E 're he shall dig his own grave in that woman : You know which way to bring her : I'le stand close there , To view her as she passes : and do you hear Menippus , Observe her with all sweetness : humour her , 'Twill make her lie more careless to our purposes.Away , and take what helps you please .
I am gone Sir. [ Exeunt .
Celia , and Governess .
Governess , from whom was this Gown sent me ? Prethee be serious true ; I will not wear't else : 'T is a handsom one .
As though you know not ?
No faith : But I believe , for certain too , yet I wonder , Because it was his caution , this poor way , Still to preserve me from the curious searchingsOf greedy eyes .
You have it : does it please you ?
'T is very rich , methinks too , prethee tell me ?
From one that likes you well , never look coy , Lady ; These are no gifts , to be put off with powtings .
Powtings , and gifts ? is it from any stranger ?
You are so curious , that there is no talk to ye.What if it be I pray ye ?
Unpin good Governess , Quick , quick .
Why , what 's the matter ?
Quick , good Governess : Fie o n't , how beastly it becomes me ! poorly ! A trick put in upon me ? well said Governess : I vow I would not wear it -- out , it smells musty.Are these your tricks ? now I begin to smell it , Abominable musty ; will you help me ? The Prince will come again --
You are not mad sure ?
As I live I'le cut it off : a pox upon it ; For sure it was made for that use ; do you bring me Liveries ? Stales to catch Kites ? dost thou laugh too , thou base woman ?
I can not chuse , if I should be hang 'd .
Abuse me , And then laugh at me too ?
I do not abuse ye : Is it abuse , to give him drink that 's thirsty ? You want cloaths ; is it such a hainous sin I beseech ye , To see you stor 'd ?
There is no greater wickednessThan this way .
What way ?
I shall curse thee fearfully , If thou provok'st me further : and take heed , woman ; My curses never miss .
Curse him that sent it .
Tell but his name --
You dare not curse him .
Dare not ? By this fair light --
You are so full of passion --
Dare not be good ? be honest ? dare not curse him ?
I think you dare not : I believe so .
Speak him .
Up with your valour then , up with it bravely , And take your full charge .
If I do not , hang me ; Tell but his name .
'T was Prince Demetrius sent it : Now , now , give fire , kill him i'th ' eye now Lady .
Is he come home ?
It seems so ; but your curse now .
You do not lie , I hope .
Prethee do not abuse me : is he come home indeed ? For I would now with all my heart believe thee .
Nay , you may chuse : alas , I deal for strangers , That send ye scurvie musty Gowns , stale Liveries : I have my tricks .
'T is a good gown , a handsome one ; I did but jest ; where is he ?
He that sent it --
How ? he that sent it ? is't come to that again ? Thou canst not be so foolish : prethee speak out , I may mistake thee .
I said he that sent it .
Curse o ' my life : why dost thou vex me thus ? I know thou meanest Demetrius , dost thou not ? I charge thee speak truth : if it be any other , Thou knowst the charge he gave thee , and the justiceHis anger will'inflift , if e 're he know this , As know he shall , he shall , thou spightfull woman , Thou beastly woman ; and thou shalt know too late too , And feel too sensible , I am no ward , No sale stuff for your money Merchants that sent if ? Who dare send me , or how durst thou , thou --
What you please : For this is ever the reward of service.The Prince shall bring the next himself .
'T is strangeThat you should deal so peevishly : beshrew ye , You have put me in a heat .
I am sure ye have kill 'd me : I ne 're receiv 'd such language : I can but wait upon ye , And be your drudge ; keep a poor life to serve ye .
You know my nature is too easie , Governess , And you know now , I am sorry too : how does he ?
O God , my head .
Prethee be well , and tell me , Did he speak of me , since he came ? nay , see now , If thou wilt leave this tyranny ? good sweet governess , Did he but name his Celia ? look upon me , Upon my faith I meant no harm : here , take this , And buy thy self some trifles : did he good wench ?
He loves ye but too dearly .
That 's my good Governess .
There 's more cloaths making for ye .
More cloaths ?
More : Richer and braver ; I can tell ye that news ; And twenty glorious things .
To what use Sirrah ?
Ye are too good for our house now : we poor wretchesShall lose the comfort of ye .
No , I hope not .
For ever lose ye Lady .
Lose me ? wherefore ? I hear of no such thing .
'T is sure it must be so : You must shine now at Court : such preparation , Such hurry , and such hanging rooms --
To th ' Court wench ? Was it to th ' Court thou saidst ?
You'l find it so .
Stay , stay , this can not be .
I say it must be : I hope to find ye still the same good Lady .
To th ' Court ? this stumbles me : art sure for me wench , This preparation is ?
She is perilous crafty : I fear too honest for us all too. Am I sure I live ?
To th ' Court ? this can not down : what should I do there ? Why should he on a suddain change his mind thus , And not make me acquainted ? sure he loves me ; His vow was made against it , and mine with him : At least while this King liv 'd : he will come hither , And see me e 're I goe ?
Wou 'd some wise womanHad her in working. That I think he will not , Because he means with all joy there to meet ye.Ye shall hear more within this hour .
A Courtier ? What may that meaning be ? sure he will see meIf he be come , he must : Hark ye good Governess , What age is the King of ?
He 's an old man , and full of business .
I fear too full indeed : what Ladys are there ? I would be loth to want good company .
Delicate young Ladys , as you would desire ; And when you are acquainted , the best company .
'T is very well : prethee goe in , let 's talk more.For though I fear a trick , Fie bravely try it .
I see he must be cunning , Knocks this Doe down. [ Exeunt .
Lieutenant , and Leontius , Drums within .
You shall not have your will , sirrah , are ye running ? Have ye gotten a toy in your heels ? Is this a season , When honour pricks ye on , to prick your ears up , After your whore , your Hobby-horse ?
Why look ye now : What a strange man are you ? would you have a man fightAt all hours all alike ?
Do but fight something ; But half a blow , and put thy stomach to't : Turn but thy face , and do-make mouths at 'em .
And have my teeth knockt out ; I thank ye heartily , Ye are my dear friend .
What a devil ails thee ? Dost long to be hang 'd ?
Faith Sir , I make no suit for't : But rather Fhan I would live thus out of charity , Continually in brawling --
Art thou not he ? I may be cosen 'd --
, I shall be discover 'd .
That in the midst of thy most hellish pains , When thou wert crawling sick , didst aim at wonders , When thou wert mad with pain ?
Ye have found the cause out ; I had ne 're been mad to fight else : I confess Sir , The daily torture of my side that vext me , Made me as daily careless what became of me , Till a kind sword there wounded me , and eas 'd me ; 'T was nothing in my valour fought ; I am well now , And take some pleasure in my life , methinks now , It shews as mad a thing to me to see you scuffle , And kill one another foolishly for honour , As 't was to you , [ t ] o see me play the coxcomb .
And wilt thou ne 're fight more ?
I'th ' mind I am in .
Nor never be sick again ?
I hope I shall not .
Prethee be sick again : prethee , I beseech thee , Be just so sick again .
I'le just be hang 'd first .
If all the Arts that are can make a Colique , Therefore look to't : or if imposthumes , mark me , As big as foot-balls --
Deliver me .
Or stones of ten pound weight i'th ' kidneys , Through ease and ugly dyets may be gather 'd ; I'le feed ye up my self Sir , I'le prepare ye , You can not fight , unless the Devil tear ye , You shall not want provocations , I'le scratch ye , I'le have thee have the tooth-ach , and the head-ach .
Good Colonel , I'le doe any thing .
No , no , nothing -- Then will I have thee blown with a pair of Smiths bellows , Because ye shall be sure to have a round gale with ye , Fill 'd full of oyle o'Devil , and Aqua-fortis , And let these work , these may provoke .
Good Colonel .
A coward in full bloud ; prethee be plain with me , Will roasting doe thee any good ?
Nor basting neither , Sir .
Marry that goes hard .
1 Gentleman .
Where are you Colonel ? The Prince experts ye Sir ; h'as hedg 'd the enemyWithin a streight , where all the hopes and valoursOf all men living can not force a passage , He has 'em now .
I knew all this before Sir , I chalk 'd him out his way : but do you see that thing there ?
Nay good sweet Colonel , I'le fight a little .
That thing ?
What thing ? I see the brave Lieutenant .
Rogue , what a name hast thou lost ?
You may help it , Yet you may help't : I'le doe ye any courtesie : I know you love a wench well .
2 Gentlemen .
Look upon him ; Do you look too .
What should I look on ? I come to tell ye , the Prince stayes your direction , We have 'em now i'th ' Coop , Sir .
Let 'em rest there , And chew upon their miseries : but look first --
I can not fight for all this .
Look on this fellow .
I know him ; 't is the valiant brave Lieutenant.Leo. Canst thou hear this , and play the Rogue ? steal off quickly , Behind me quickly neatly do it , And rush into the thickest of the enemy , And if thou kill'st but two .
You may excuse me , 'T is not my fault : I dare not fight .
Be rul 'd yet , I'le beat thee on ; goe wink and fight : a plague upon your sheeps heart .
What 's all this matter ?
Nay I can not shew ye .
Here 's twenty pound , goe but smell to 'em .
Alas Sir , I have taken such a cold I can smell nothing .
I can smell a Rascal , a rank Rascal : Fye , how he stinks , stinks like a tyred Jade .
What Sir ?
Why , that Sir , do not you smell him ?
Smell him ?
I must endure .
Stinks like a dead Dog , Carrion -- There 's no such damnable smell under Heaven , As the faint sweat of a Coward : will ye fight yet ?
Nay , now I defie ye ; ye have spoke the worst ye canOf me , and if every man should take what you sayTo the heart. --
God ha ' Mercy , God ha ' Mercy with all my heart ; here I forgive thee ; And fight , or fight not , do but goe along with us , And keep my Dog .
I love a good Dog naturally .
What 's all this stir , Lieutenant ?
Nothing Sir , But a slight matter of argument .
Pox take thee.Sure I shall love this Rogue , he 's so pretty a Coward.Come Gentlemen , let 's up now , and if fortuneDare play the slut again , I'le never more Saint her , Come play-fellow , come , prethee come up ; come chicken , I have a way shall fit yet : A tame knave , Come , look upon us .
I'le tell ye who does best boyes. [ Exeunt .
Antigonus , and Menippus , above .
I saw her coming out .
Who waits upon her ?
Timon , Charinthus , and some other Gentlemen , By me appointed .
Where 's your wife ?
She 's readyTo entertain her here Sir ; and some LadiesFit for her lodgings .
How shews she in her trim now ?
Oh most divinely sweet .
Prethee speak softly.How does she take her coming ?
She bears it bravely ; But what she thinks -- For Heaven sake Sir preserve me -- If the Prince chance to find this .
Peace ye old fool ; She thinks to meet him here .
That 's all the Project .
Was she hard to bring ?
No she believ 'd it quickly , And quickly made her self fit , the Gown a little , And those new things she has not been acquainted with , At least in this place , where she liv 'd a prisoner , Troubled and stirr 'd her mind. But believe me Sir , She has worn as good , they sit so apted to her ; And she is so great a Mistris of disposure : Here they come now : but take a full view of her .
Celia , Timon , Charinthus , and Gent .
How cheerfully she looks ? how she salutes all ? And how she views the place ? she is very young sure : That was an admirable smile , a catching one , The very twang of Cupids bow sung in it : She has two-edg 'd eyes , they kill o ' both sides .
She makes a stand , as though she would speak .
Be still then .
Good Gentlemen , trouble your selves no further , I had thought sure to have met a noble friend here .
Ye may meet many Lady .
Such as you areI covet few or none , Sir .
Will you walk this way , And take the sweets o'th ' garden ? cool and close , Lady .
Methinks this open air 's far better , tend ye that wayPray where 's the woman came along ?
What woman ?
The woman of the house I lay at .
Woman ? Here was none came along sure .
Sure I am catcht then : Pray where 's the Prince ?
He will not be long from ye , We are his humble Servants .
I could laugh now , To see how finely I am cozen 'd : yet I fear not , For sure I know a way to scape all dangers .
Madam , your lodgings lye this way .
My Lodgings ? For Heaven sake Sir , what office do I bear here ?
The great commander of all hearts .
Leucippe , and Ladies .
You have hit it.I thank your sweet heart for it. Who are these now ?
Ladies that come to serve ye .
Well consider 'd , Are you my Servants ?
Servants to your pleasures .
I dare believe ye , but I dare not trust ye : Catch 'd with a trick ? well , I must bear it patiently : Methinks this Court 's a neat place : all the peopleOf so refin 'd a size --
This is no poor Rogue .
Were it a Paradise to please your fancy , And entertain the sweetness you bring with ye .
Take breath ; You are fat , and many words may melt ye , This is three Bawdes beaten into one ; bless me Heaven , What shall become of me ? I am i'th ' pitfall : O ' my conscience , this is the old viper , and all these little onesCreep every night into her belly ; do you hear plump servantAnd you my little sucking Ladies , you must teach me , For I know you are excellent at carriage , How to behave my self , for I am rude yet : But you say the Prince will come ?
Will flie to see you .
For look you if a great man , say the King nowShould come and visit me ?
She names ye .
Peace fool .
And offer me a kindness , such a kindness .
I , such a kindness .
True Lady such a kindness , What shall that kindness be now ?
A witty Lady , Learn little ones , learn .
Say it be all his favour .
And a sweet saying 't is .
And I grow peevish ?
You must not be negleftfull .
There 's the matter , There 's the main doctrine now , and I may miss it , Or a kind handsom Gentleman ?
You say well .
They'I count us basely bred .
Not freely nurtur 'd .
I'le take thy counsel .
'T is an excellent woman .
I find a notable volum here , a learned one ; Which way ? for I would fain be in my chamber ; In truth sweet Ladies , I grow weary ; fie , How hot the air beats on me !
This way Madam .
Now by mine honour , I grow wondrous faint too .
Your fans sweet Gentlewomen , your fans .
Since I am fool 'd , I'le make my self some sport , though I pay dear for't. [ Ex .
You see now what a manner of woman she is Sir .
Thou art an ass .
Is this a fit love for the Prince:
A coxcombe : Now by my crown a daintie wench , a sharp wench , And/a matchless Spirit : how she jeer 'd 'em ? How carelesly she scoff 'd 'em ? use her nobly ; I would I had not seen her : wait anon , And then you shall have more to trade upon. [ Exeunt .
Leontius , and the 2 Gentlemen .
We must keep a round , and a strong watch to night , The Prince will not charge the Enemy till the morning : But for the trick I told ye for this Rascal , This rogue , that health and strong heart makes a coward .
I , if it take .
Ne 're fear it , the Prince has it , And if he let it fall , I must not know it ; He will suspecl : me presently : but you twoMay help the plough .
That he is sick again .
Extreamly sick : his disease grown incurable , Never yet found , nor touch 'd at .
Lieutenant .
Well , we have it , And here he comes .
The Prince has been upon him , What a flatten face he has now ? it takes , believe it ; How like an Ass he looks ?
I feel no great pain , At least , I think I do not ; yet I feel sensiblyI grow extreamly faint : how cold I sweat now !
So , so , so .
And now 't is ev'n too true , I feel a pricking , A pricking , a strange pricking : how it tingles ! And as it were a stitch too : the Prince told me , And every one cri 'd out I was a dead man ; I had thought I had been as well --
Upon him now Boys , And do it most demurely .
How now Lieutenant ?
I thank ye Gentlemen .
'Life , how looks this man ? How dost thou good Lieutenant ?
I ever told yeThis man was never cur 'd , I see it too plain now ; How do you feel your self ? you look not perfect , How dull his eye hangs ?
That may be discontent .
Believe me friend , I would not suffer nowThe tith of those pains this man feels ; mark his foreheadWhat a cloud of cold dew hangs upo n't ?
I have it , Again I have it ; how it grows upon me ! A miserable man I am .
Ha , ha , ha , A miserable man thou shall be , This is the tamest Trout I ever tickl 'd .
2 Physicians .
This way he went .
Pray Heaven we find him living , He 's a brave fellow , 't is pity he should perish thus .
A strong hearted man , and of a notable sufferance .
Oh , oh .
How now ? how is it man ?
Oh Gentlemen , Never so full of pain .
Did I not tell ye ?
Never so full of pain , Gentlemen .
He is here ; How do you , Sir ?
Be of good comfort , Souldier , The Prince has sent us to you .
Do you think I may live ?
He alters hourly , strangely .
Yes , you may live : but --
Finely butted , Doctor .
Do not discourage him .
He must be told truth , 'T is now too late to trifle .
Demetrius , and Gent .
Here the Prince comes .
How now Gentlemen ?
Bewailing , Sir , a Souldier , And one I think , your Grace will grieve to part with , But every living thing --
'T is true , must perish , Our lives are but our marches to our graves , How dost thou now Lieutenant ?
Faith 't is true , Sir , We are but spans , and Candles ends .
He 's finely mortified .
Thou art heart whole yet I see he alters strangely , And that apace too ; I saw it this morning in him , When he poor man , I dare swear --
No believ't , Sir , I never felt it .
Here lies the pain now : how he is swel 'd ?
The ImpostumeFed with a new malignant humour now , Will grow to such a bigness , 't is incredible , The compass of a Bushel will not hold it.And with such a Hell of torture it will rise too --
Can you endure me touch it ?
Oh , I beseech you , Sir : I feel you sensibly ere you come near me .
He 's finely wrought , he must be cut , no Cure else , And suddenly , you see how fast he blows out .
Good Master Doctors , let me be beholding to you , I feel I can not last .
For what Lieutenant ?
But ev'n for half a dozen Cans of good Wine , That I may drink my will out : I faint hideously. ( men,
Fetch him some Wine ; and since he must go Gentle -- Whylet him take his journey merrily .
Servant with Wine .
That 's ev'n the nearest way .
I could laugh dead now .
Here , off with that .
These two I give your Grace , A poor remembrance of a dying man , Sir , And I beseech you wear 'em out .
I will Souldier , These are fine Legacies .
Among the Gentlemen , Even all I have left ; I am a poor man , naked , Yet something for remembra [ n ] ce : four a piece Gentlemen , And so my body where you please .
It will work .
I make your Grace my Executor , and I beseech yeSee my poor Will fulfill 'd : sure I shall walk else .
As full as they can be fill 'd , here 's my hand , Souldier .
The Wine will tickle him .
I would hear a Drum beat , But to see how I could endure it .
Beat a Drum there. [ Drum within .
Oh Heavenly Musick , I would hear one sing to't ; I am very full of pain .
Sing ? 't is impossible .
Why , then I would drink a Drum full : Where lies the Enemy ?
Why , here close by .
Now he begins to muster .
And dare he fight ? Dare he fight Gentlemen ?
You must not cut him : He 's gone then in a moment ; all the hope left , isTo work his weakness into suddain anger , And make him raise his passion above his pain , And so dispose him on the Enemy ; His body then , being stir 'd with violence , Will purge it self and break the sore .
'T is true , Sir .
And then my life for his .
I will not dye thus .
But he is too weak to do --
Dye like a Dog ?
I , he 's weak , but yet he 's heart whole .
Hem .
An excellent sign .
Hem .
Stronger still , and better .
Hem , hem ; ran , tan , tan , tan , tan. [ Exit .
Now he 's i'th ' way o n't .
Well go thy waies , thou wilt do something certain .
And some brave thing , or let mine ears be cut off.He 's finely wrought .
Let 's after him .
I pray , Sir ; But how this Rogue , when this cloud 's melted in him , And all discover 'd --
That 's for an after mirth , away , away , away. [ Ex .
Let no man fear to dye : we love to sleep all , And death is but the sounder sleep ; all ages , And all hours call us ; 't is so common , easie , That little Children tread those paths before us ; We are not sick , nor our souls prest with sorrows , Nor go we out like tedious tales , forgotten ; High , high we come , and hearty to our Funerals , And as the Sun that sets , in bloud let 's fall .
'T is true , they have us fast , we can not scape 'emNor keeps the brow of fortune one smile for us , Dishonourable ends we can scape though , And ( worse than those Captivities ) we can die , And dying nobly , though we leave behind usThese clods of flesh , that are too massie burthens , Our living souls flie crown 'd with living conquests .
They have begun , fight bravely , and fall bravely ; And may that man that seeks to save his life nowBy price , or promise , or by fear falls from us , Never again be blest with name of Souldier .
How now ? who charged first ? I seek a brave handTo set me off in death .
We are not charg 'd , Sir , The Prince lies still .
How comes this Larum up then ?
There is one desperate fellow , with the Devil in him ( He never durst do this else ) has broke into us , And here he bangs ye two or three before him , There five or six ; ventures upon whole Companies .
And is not seconded ?
Not a man follows .
Nor cut i ' pieces ?
Their wonder yet has staid 'em .
Let 's in , and see this miracle ?
I admire it. [ Ex .
Fetch him off , fetch him off ; I am sure he 's clouted ; Did I hot tell you how 'twould take ?
'T is admirable .
Follow that blow , my friend , there 's at your coxcombs , I fight to save me from the Surgions miseries .
How the Knave curries 'em ?
You can not Rogues , Till you have my Diseases , flie my fury , Ye Bread and Butter Rogues , do ye run from me ? And my side would give me leave , I would so hunt ye , Ye Porridg gutted Slaves , ye Veal broth-Boobies .
Enough , enough Lieutenant , thou hast done bravely .
Mirrour of man .
There 's a Flag for ye , Sir , I took it out o'th ' shop , and never paid for't , I'le to 'em again , I am not come to th ' text yet .
No more my Souldier : beshrew my heart he is hurt sore .
Hang him , he'l lick all th^se whole .
Now will we take him , And Cure him in a trice .
Be careful of him .
Let me live but two years , And do what ye will with me ; I never had but two hours yet of happiness ; Pray ye give me nothing to provoke my valour , For I am ev'n as weary of this fighting --
Ye shall have nothing ; come to the Princes TentAnd there the Surgions presently shall search ye , Then to your rest .
A little handsome LitterTo lay me in , and I shall sleep .
Look to him .
I do believe a Horse begot this fellow , He never knew his strength yet ; they are our own .
I think so , I am cozen 'd else ; I would but see nowA way to fetch these off , and save their honours .
Only their lives .
Pray ye take no way of peace now , Unless it be with infinite advantage .
I shall be rul 'd ; Let the Battels now move forward , Our self will give the signal : Enter Trumpet and Herald.Now Herald , what 's your message ?
From my Masters , This honourable courtesie , a ParleyFor half an hour , no more , Sir .
Let 'em come on , They have my Princely word .
Seleucus , Lysimacus , Ptolomie , Attendants , Souldiers .
They are here to attend ye .
Now Princes , your demands ?
Peace , if it may beWithout the too much tainture of our honour : Peace , and we'l buy it too .
At what price ?
Tribute .
At all the charge of this War .
That will not do .
Leontius , you and I have serv 'd together , And run through many a Fortune with our swords , Brothers in Wounds and Health ; one meat has fed us , One Tent a thousand times from cold night cover 'd us : Our loves have been but one ; and had we died then , One Monument had held our names , and actions : Why do you set upon your friends such prices ? And sacrifice to giddy chance such Trophies ? Have we forgot to dye ? or are our vertuesLess in afflictions constant , than our fortunes ? Ye are deceiv 'd old Souldier .
I know your worths , And thus low bow in reverence to your vertues : Were these my Wars , or led my power in chief here , I knew then how to meet your memories : They are my Kings imployments ; this man fights now , To whom I ow all duty , faith , and service ; This man that fled before ye ; call back that , That bloudy day again , call that disgrace home , And then an easie Peace may sheath our Swords up.I am not greedy of your lives and fortunes , Nor do I gape ungratefully to swallow ye.Honour , the spur of all illustrious natures , That made you famous Souldiers , and next Kings , And not ambitious envy strikes me forward.Will ye unarm , and yield your selves his prisoners ?
We never knew what that sound meant : no GyvesShall ever bind this body , but embraces ; Nor weight of sorrow here , till Earth fall on me .
Expect our charge then .
'T is the nobler courtesie : And so we leave the hand of Heaven to bless us .
Stay , have you any hope ?
We have none left us , But that one comfort of our deaths together ; Give us but room to fight .
Win it , and wear it .
Call from the hills those Companies hang o 're us , Like bursting Clouds ; and then break in , and take us .
Find such a Souldier will forsake advantage , And we 'll draw off to shew I dare be noble , And hang a light out to ye in this darkness , The light of peace ; give up those Cities , Forts , And all those Frontier Countries to our uses .
Is this the Peace ? Traitors to those that feed us , Our Gods and people ? give our Countries from us ?
Begin the Knell , it sounds a great deal sweeter .
Let loose your servant , death .
Fall fate upon us , Our memories shall never stink behind us .
Seleucus , great Seleucus .
The Prince calls , Sir .
Thou stock of nobleness , and courtesie , Thou Father of the War --
What means the Prince now ?
Give me my Standard here .
His anger 's melted .
You Gentlemen that were his prisoners , And felt the bounty of that noble nature , Lay all your hands , and bear these Colours to him , The Standard of the Kingdom ; take it Souldier .
What will this mean ?
Thou hast won it , bear it off , And draw thy men home whilest we wait upon thee .
You shall have all our Countries .
All by Heaven , Sir .
I will not have a stone , a bush , a bramble , No , in the way of courtesie , I'le start ye ; Draw off , and make a lane through all the Army , That these that have subdu 'd us , may march through us .
Sir , do not make me surfeit with such goodness , I'le bear your Standard for ye ; follow ye .
I swear it shall be so , march through me fairly , And thine be this days honour , great Seleucus .
Mirrour of noble minds .
Nay then ye hate me .
I can not speak now : [ Ex. with Drums , and Shouts.Well , go thy wayes ; at a sure piece of braveryThou art the best , these men are won by th ' necks now : I'le send a Post away .
No aptness in her ?
Not an immodest motion , And yet when she is courted , Makes as wild witty answers .
This more fires me , I must not have her thus .
We can not alter her .
Have ye put the youths upon her ?
All that know any thing , And have been studied how to catch a beauty , But like so many whelps about an Elephant -- The Prince is coming home , Sir .
I hear that too , But that 's no matter ; am I alter 'd well ?
Not to be known I think , Sir .
I must see her .
I offered all I had , all I could think of , I tri 'd her through all the points o'th ' compass , I think .
She studies to undo the Court , to plant hereThe Enemy to our Age , Chastity ; She is the first , that e 're bauk 'd a close Arbour , And the sweet contents within : She hates curl 'd heads too , And setting up of beards she swears is Idolatry .
I never knew so fair a face so froze ; Yet she would make one think --
True by her carriage , For she 's as wanton as a Kid to th ' out side , As full of Mocks and Taunts : I kiss 'd her hand too , Walkt with her half an hour .
She heard me sing , And sung her self too ; she sings admirably ; But still when any hope was , as 't is her trickTo minister enough of those , then presentlyWith some new flam or other , nothing to the matter , And such a frown , as would sink all before her , She takes her Chamber ; come , we shall not be the last fools .
Not by a hundred I hope ; 't is a strange wench .
This screws me up still higher .
Here she comes , Sir .
Then be you gone ; and take the Women with ye , And lay those Jewels in her way .
She sees me now : O Heaven , a most rare creature !
Yes , 't is the same : I will take no notice of ye , But if I do not fit ye , let me fry for't ; Is all this Cackling for your egg ? they are fair ones , Excellent rich no doubt too ; and may stumbleA good staid mind , but I can go thus by 'em ; My honest friend ; do you set off these Jewels ?
Set 'em off , Lady ?
I mean , sell 'em here , Sir ?
She 's very quick ; for sale they are not meant sure .
For sanctity I think much less : good even Sir .
Nay noble Lady , stay : 't is you must wear 'em : Never look strange , they are worthy your best beauty .
Did you speak to me ?
To you or to none living : To you they are sent , to you they are sacrificed .
I'le never look a Horse i'th ' mouth that 's given : I thank ye , Sir : I'le send one to reward ye .
Do you never ask who sent 'em ?
Never I : Nor never care , if it be an honest end , That end 's the full reward , and thanks but slubber it ; If it be ill , I will not urge the acquaintance .
This has a soul indeed : pray let me tell ye --
I care not if ye do , so you do it hansomly , And not stand picking of your words .
The King sent 'em .
Away , away , thou art some foolish fellow , And now I think thou hast stole 'em too : the King sent 'em ? Alas good man , wouldst thou make me believeHe has nothing to do with things of these worths , But wantonly to fling 'em ? he 's an old man , A good old man , they say too : I dare swearFull many a year ago he left these gambols : Here , take your trinkets .
Sure I do not lye , Lady .
I know thou lyest extreamly , damnably : Thou hast a lying face .
I was never thus ratled .
But say I should believe : why are these sent me ? And why art thou the Messenger ? who art thou ?
Lady , look on 'em wisely , and then considerWho can send such as these , but a King only ? And , to what beauty can they be oblations , But only yours ? For me that am the carrier , 'T is only fit you know I am his servant , And have fulfil 'd his will .
You are short and pithy ; What must my beauty do for these ?
Sweet Lady , You can not be so hard of understanding , When a King 's favour shines upon ye gloriously , And speaks his love in these --
O then love 's the matter ; Sir-reverence love ; now I begin to feel ye : And I should be the Kings Whore , a brave title ; And go as glorious as the Sun , O brave still : The chief Commandress of his Concubines , Hurried from place to place to meet his pleasures .
A devilish subtil wench , but a rare spirit. ( dry,
And when the good old spunge had suckt my youthAnd left some of his Royal aches in my bones : When time shall tell me I have plough 'd my life up , And cast long furrows in my face to sink me .
You must not think so , Lady .
Then can these , Sir , These precious things , the price of youth and beauty ; This shop here of sin-offerings set me off again ? Can it restore me chaste , young , innocent ? Purge me to what I was ? add to my memoryAn honest and a noble fame ? The Kings device ; The sin 's as universal as the Sun is , And lights an everlasting Torch to shame me .
Do you hold so sleight account of a great Kings favour , That all knees bow to purchase ?
Prethee peace : If thou knewst how ill favouredly thy tale becomes thee , And what ill root it takes --
You will be wiser .
Could the King find no shape to shift his pander into , But reverend Age ? and one so like himself too ?
She has found me out .
Cozen the world with gravity ? Prethee resolve me one thing , do 's the King love thee ?
I think he do 's .
It seems so by thy Office : He loves thy use , and when that 's ended , hates thee : Thou seemest to me a Souldier .
Yes , I am one .
And hast fought for thy Country ?
Many a time .
May be , commanded too ?
I have done , Lady .
O wretched man , below the state of pity ! Canst thou forget thou wert begot in honour ? A free Companion for a King ? a Souldier ? Whose Nobleness dare feel no want , but Enemies ? Canst thou forget this , and decline so wretchedly , To eat the Bread of Bawdry , of base Bawdry ? Feed on the scum of Sin ? fling thy Sword from thee ? Dishonour to the noble name that nursed thee ? Go , beg diseases : let them be thy Armours , Thy fights , the flames of Lust , and their foul issues .
Why then I am a King , and mine own Speaker .
And I as free as you , mine own Disposer : There , take your Jewels ; let them give them lustresThat have dark Lives and Souls ; wear 'em your self , Sir , You'l seem a Devil else .
I command ye stay .
Be just , I am commanded .
I will not wrong ye .
Then thus low falls my duty .
Can ye love me ? Say I , and all I have --
I can not love ye ; Without the breach of faith I can not hear ye ; Ye hang upon my love , like frosts on Lilies : I can dye , but I can not love : you are answer 'd .
I must find apter means , I love her truly .
Demetr. Leon. Lieu. Gent. Sould. and Host .
Hither do you say she is come ?
Yes Sir , I am sure o n't : For whilest I waited upon ye , putting my Wife in trust , I know not by what means , but the King found her , And hither she was brought ; how , or to what end --
My Father found her ?
So my Wife informs me .
Leontius , pray draw off the Souldiers , I would a while be private .
Fall off Gentlemen , The Prince would be alone. [ Ex. Leo and Soul .
Is he so cunning ? There is some trick in this , and you must know it , And be an agent too : which if it prove so --
Pull me to pieces , Sir .
My Father found her ? My Father brought her hither ? went she willingly ?
My Wife sayes full of doubts .
I can not blame her , No more : there 's no trust , no faith in mankind .
Antigonus , Menippus , Leontius , and Souldiers .
Keep her up close , he must not come to see her : You are welcome nobly now , welcome home Gentlemen ; You have done a courteous service on the EnemyHas tyed his Faith for ever ; you shall find it ; Ye are not now in 's debt Son : still your sad looks ?
, what 's the matter ?
Truth Sir , I know not.We have been merry since we went .
I feel it .
Come , what 's the matter now ? do you want mony ? Sure he has heard o'th ' wench .
Is that a want , Sir ? I would fain speak to your Grace .
You may do freely .
And not deserve your anger ?
That ye may too .
There was a Gentlewoman , and sometimes my prisoner , Which I thought well of Sir : your Grace conceives me .
I do indeed , and with much grief conceive ye ; With full as much grief as your Mother bare you.There was such a Woman : would I might as well say , There was no such , Demetrius .
She was vertuous , And therefore not unfit my youth to love her : She was as fair --
Her beauty I'le proclaim too , To be as rich as ever raign 'd in Woman ; But how she made that good , the Devil knows .
She was -- O Heaven !
The Hell to all thy glories , Swallow 'd thy youth , made shipwrack of thine honour : She was a Devil .
Ye are my father , Sir .
And since ye take a pride to shew your follies , I'le muster 'em , and all the world shall view 'em .
What heat is this ? the Kings eyes speak his anger .
Thou hast abus 'd thy youth , drawn to thy fellowshipInstead of Arts and Arms , a Womans kisses , The subtilties , and soft heats of a Harlot .
Good Sir , mistake her not .
A Witch , a Sorceress : I tell thee but the truth ; and hear Demetrius , Which has so dealt upon thy bloud with charms , Devilish and dark ; so lockt up all thy vertues ; So pluckt thee back from what thou sprungst from , glorious .
O Heaven , that any tongue but his durst say this ! That any heart durst harbour it ! Dread Father , If for the innocent the gods allow usTo bend our knees --
Away , thou art bewitch 'd still ; Though she be dead , her power still lives upon thee .
Dead ? O sacred Sir : dead did you say ?
She is dead , fool .
It is not possible : be not so angry , Say she is faln under your sad displeasure , Or any thing but dead , say she is banished , Invent a crime , and I'le believe it , Sir .
Dead by the Law : we found her Hell , and her , I mean her Charms and Spells , for which she perish 'd ; And she confest she drew thee to thy ruine , And purpos 'd it , purpos 'd my Empires overthrow .
But is she dead ? was there no pity Sir ? If her youth err 'd , was there no mercy shown her ? Did ye look on her face , when ye condemn 'd her ?
I look 'd into her heart , and there she was hideous .
Can she be dead ? can vertue fall untimely ?
She is dead , deservingly she died .
I have done then.O matchless sweetness , whither art thou vanished ? O thou fair soul of all thy Sex , what ParadiseHast thou inrich 'd and blest ? I am your son , Sir , And to all you shall command stand most obedient , Only a little time I must intreat youTo study to forget her ; 'twill not be long , Sir , Nor I long after it : art thou dead Celia , Dead my poor wench ? my joy , pluckt green with violence : O fair sweet flower , farewel ; Come , thou destroyerSorrow , thou melter of the soul , dwell with me ; Dwell with me solitary thoughts , tears , cryings , Nothing that loves the day , love me , or seek me , Nothing that loves his own life haunt about me : And Love , I charge thee , never charm mine eyes more , Nor ne 're betray a beauty to my curses : For I shall curse all now , hate all , forswear all , And all the brood of fruitful nature vex at , For she is gone that was all , and I nothing -- [ Ex. & Gent .
This opinion must be maintained .
It shall be , Sir .
Let him go ; I can at mine own pleasureDraw him to th ' right again : wait your instructions , And see the souldier paid , Leontius : Once more ye are welcome home all .
Health to your Majesty. [ Ex. Antig. & c .
Thou wentest along the journey , how canst thou tell ?
I did , but I am sure 't is so : had I staid behind , I think this had not proved .
A Wench the reason ?
Who 's that talks of a Wench there ?
All this discontentAbout a Wench ?
Where is this Wench , good Colonel ?
Prithee hold thy Peace : who calls thee to counsel ?
Why , if there be a Wench --
'T is fit thou know her:
2 Gentlemen.That I'le say for thee , and as fit thou art for her , Let her be mewed or stopt : how is it Gentlemen ?
He 's wondrous discontent , he'l speak to no man .
H'as taken his Chamber close , admits no entrance ; Tears in his eyes , and cryings out .
'T is so , Sir , And now I wish myself half hang 'd ere I went this journey .
What is this Woman ?
I .
I can not tell ye , But handsome as Heaven .
She is not so high I hope , Sir .
Where is she ?
I , that would be known .
Why , Sirrah .
I can not show ye neither ; The King has now dispos 'd of her .
There lyes the matter : Will he admit none to come to comfort him ?
Not any near , nor , let 'em knock their hearts out , Will never speak .
'T is the best way if he have her ; For look you , a man would be loth to be disturb 'd in 's pastime ; 'T is every good mans case .
'T is all thy living , We must not suffer this , we dare not suffer it : For when these tender souls meet deep afflictions , They are not strong enough to struggle with 'em , But drop away as Snow does , from a mountain , And in the torrent of their own sighs sink themselves : I will , and must speak to him .
So must I too : He promised me a charge .
Of what ? of ChildrenUpon my Conscience , thou hast a double company , And all of thine own begetting already .
That 's all one , I'le raise 'em to a Regiment , and then command 'em , When they turn disobedient , unbeget 'em : Knock 'em o'th ' head , and put in new .
A rare way ; But for all this , thou art not valiant enoughTo dare to see the Prince now ?
Do ye think he 's angry ?
Extreamly vext .
To the endangering of any man comes near him .
Yet , if thou couldst but win him out , What e 're thy suit were , Believe it granted presently .
Yet thou must think though , That in the doing he may break upon ye , And --
If he do not kill me .
There 's the question .
For half a dozen hurts .
Art thou so valiant ?
Not absolutely so neither : no it can not be , I want my impostumes , and my things about me , Yet I'le make danger , Colonel .
'Twill be rare sport , Howe 're it take ; give me thy hand ; if thou dost this , I'le raise thee up a horse Troop , take my word for't .
What may be done by humane man .
Let 's go then .
Away before he cool : he will relapse else. [ Ex .
Will she not yield ?
For all we can urge to her ; I swore you would marry her , she laugh 'd extreamly , And then she rail 'd like thunder .
Call in the Magician. Enter Magician with a Bowl.I must , and will obtain her , I am ashes else.Are all the Philters in ? Charms , Powders , Roots ?
They are all in ; and now I only stayThe invocation of some helping Spirits .

Sit still , and fear not .
I shall ne'r endure these sights .

Venus cryed , When the Boy Adonis dyed,
Medea 's Charm , with whichJasons heart she did bewitch , Omphale this Spell put in , When she made the Libyan spin.This dull root pluckt from Lethe flood , Purges all pure thoughts , and good.These I stir thus , round , round , round , Whilst our light feet beat the ground .

Now if she have an antidote art let her 'scape me. [ Exeunt .
There 's the door , Lieutenant , if you dare do any thing .
Here 's no man waits .

Let me put on my Skull first.My head 's almost beaten into th ' pap of an Apple.Are there no Guns i'th ' door ?
The Rogue will do it.And yet I know he has no Stomach to't .
What loop-holes are there when I knock for stones , For those may pepper me ? I can perceive none .
How he views the Fortification .
Farewel Gentlemen , If I be kill 'd --
We 'll see thee buried bravely .
Away , how should I know that then ? I 'll knock softly.Pray heaven he speak in a low voice now to comfort me : I feel I have no heart to't : -- Is't well , Gentlemen ? Colonel , my Troop --
A little louder .
Stay , stay ; Here is a window , I will see , stand wide.By -- -- he 's charging of a Gun .
There 's no such matter.There 's no body in this room .
O 't was a fire-shovel : Now I 'll knock louder ; if he say who 's there ? As sure he has so much manners , then will I answer himSo finely & demurely ; my Troop Colonel -- [ knocks louder .
Knock louder , Fool , he hears not .
You fool , do you.Do and you dare now .
I do not undertake it .
Then hold your peace , and meddle with your own matters .
Now he will knock. [ Knocks louder .
Sir , Sir , will't please you hear Sir ? Your Grace , I 'll look again , what 's that ?
He 's there now.Lord ! How he stares ! I ne'r yet saw him thus alter 'd : Stand now , and take the Troop .
Would I were i n't , And a good horse under me : I must knock again , The Devil 's at my fingers ends : he comes now.Now Colonel , if I live --
The Troop 's thine own Boy .

What desperate fool , ambitious of his ruine ?
Your Father would desire ye , Sir , to come to dinner .
Thou art no more .
Now , now , now , now .
Poor Coxcomb : Why do I aim at thee ? [ Exit .
His fear has kill 'd him .
I protest he 's almost stiff : bend him and rub him , Hold his Nose close , you , if you be a woman , Help us a little : here 's a man near perish 'd .
Alas alas , I have nothing here about me.Look to my Bowl ; I 'll run in presentlyAnd fetch some water : bend him , and set him upwards .
A goodly man -- [ Exit.Here 's a brave heart : he 's warm again : you shall notLeave us i'th ' lurch so , Sirrah .
Now he breaths too .
If we had but any drink to raise his Spirits.What 's that i'th ' Bowl ? upon my life , good Liquor , She would not own it else .
He sees .
Look up Boy.And take this Cup , and drink it off ; I 'll pledge thee.Guide it to his mouth , he swallows heartily .
Oh ! fear and sorrow 's dry ; 't is off --
Stand up man .
Am I not shot ?
Away with him , and chear him : Thou hast won thy Troop .
I think I won it bravely .
Go , I must see the Prince , he must not live thus ; And let me hear an hour hence from ye.Well , Sir -- [ Exeunt Gent. and Lieu .
Here , here : where 's the sick Gentleman ?
He 's up , and gone , Lady .
Alas , that I came so late .
He must still thank ye ; Ye left that in a Cup here did him comfort .
That in the Bowl ?
Yes truly , very much comfort , He drank it off , and after it spoke lustily .
Did he drink it all ?
All off .
The Devil choak him ; I am undone : h'as twenty Devils in him ; Undone for ever , left he none ?
I think not .
No , not a drop : what shall become of me now ? Had he no where else to swound ? a vengeance swound him : Undone , undone , undone : stay , I can lye yetAnd swear too at a pinch , that 's all my comfort.Look to him ; I say look to him , & but mark what follows. [ Ex .
What a Devil ails the Woman ? here comes the Prince again , With such a sadness on his face , as sorrow , Sorrow her self but poorly imitates.Sorrow of Sorrows on that heart that caus 'd it .
Why might she not be false and treacherous to me ? And found so by my Father ? she was a Woman , And many a one of that Sex , young and fair , As full of faith as she , have fallen , and foully .
It is a Wench ! O that I knew the circumstance .
Why might not , to preserve me from this ruine , She having lost her honour , and abused me , My father change the forms o'th ' coins , and executeHis anger on a fault she ne'r committed , Only to keep me safe ? why should I think so ? She never was to me , but all obedience , Sweetness , and love .
How heartily he weeps now ! I have not wept this thirty years , and upward ; But now , if I should be hang 'd I can not hold from'tIt grieves me to the heart .
Who 's that that mocks me ?
A plague of him that mocks ye : I grieve truly , Truly , and heartily to see you thus , Sir : And if it lay in my power , gods are my witness , Who e'r he be that took your sweet peace from you ; I am not so old yet , nor want I spirit --
No more of that , no more Leontius , Revenges are the gods : our part is sufferance : Farewell , I shall not see thee long .
Good Sir , tell me the cause , I know there is a woman i n't ; Do you hold me faithful ? dare you trust your Souldier ? Sweet Prince , the cause ?
I must not , dare not tell it , And as thou art an honest man , enquire not .
Will ye be merry then ?
I am wondrous merry .
'T is wondrous well : you think now this becomes ye.Shame o n't , it does not , Sir , it shews not handsomely ; If I were thus ; you would swear I were an Ass straight ; A wooden ass ; whine for a Wench ?
Prithee leave me .
I will not leave ye for a tit .
For that you may have any where for six pence , And a dear penny-worth too .
Nay , then you are troublesome .
Not half so troublesom as you are to your self , Sir ; Was that brave Heart made to pant for a placket : And now i'th ' dog-days too , when nothing dare love ! That noble Mind to melt away and moulderFor a hey nonny , nonny ! Would I had a Glass here , To shew ye what a pretty toy ye are turn 'd to .
My wretched Fortune .
Will ye but let me know her ? I 'll once turn Bawd : go to , they are good mens offices , And not so contemptible as we take 'em for : And if she be above ground , and a Woman ; I ask no more ; I 'll bring her o ' my back , Sir , By this hand I will , and I had as lieve bring the Devil , I care not who she be , nor where I have her ; And in your arms , or the next Bed deliver her , Which you think fittest , and when you have danc 'd your galliard .
Away , and fool to them are so affected : O thou art gone , and all my comfort with thee ! Wilt thou do one thing for me ?
All things i'th ' World , Sir , Of all dangers .
Swear .
I will .
Come near me no more then .
How ?
Come no more near me : Thou art a plague-sore to me. [ Exit .
Give you good ev'n Sir ; If you be suffer 'd thus , we shall have fine sport.I will be sorry yet .
How now , how does he ?
Nay , if I tell ye , hang me , or any man elseThat hath his nineteen wits ; he has the bots I think , He groans , and roars , and kicks .
Will he speak yet ?
Not willingly : Shortly he will not see a man ; if everI look 'd upon a Prince so metamorphos 'd , So juggl 'd into I know not what , shame take me ; This 't is to be in love .
Is that the cause o n't ?
What is it not the cause of but bear-baitings ? And yet it stinks much like it : out upo n't ; What giants , and what dwarffs , what owls and apes , What dogs , and cats it makes us ? men that are possest with it , Live as if they had a Legion of Devils in 'em , And every Devil of a several nature ; Nothing but Hey-pass , re-pass : where 's the Lieutenant ? Has he gather 'd up the end on 's wits again ?
He is alive : but you that talk of wonders , Shew me but such a wonder as he is now .
Why ? he was ever at the worst a wonder .
He is now most wonderful ; a Blazer now , Sir .
What ails the Fool ? and what Star reigns now GentlemenWe have such Prodigies ?
'Twill pose your heaven-hunters ; He talks now of the King , no other language , And with the King as he imagines , hourly.Courts the King , drinks to the King , dies for the King , Buys all the Pictures of the King , wears the Kings colours .
Does he not lye i'th ' King street too ?
He 's going thither , Makes prayers for the King , in sundry languages , Turns all his Proclamations into metre ; Is really in love with the King , most dotingly , And swears Adonis was a Devil to him : A sweet King , a most comely King , and such a King --
Then down on 's marrow-bones ; O excellent KingThus he begins , Thou Light , and Life of Creatures , Angel-ey 'd King , vouchsafe at length thy favour ; And so proceeds to incision : what think ye of this sorrow ?
Will as familiarly kiss the King [ 's ] horsesAs they pass by him : ready to ravish his footman .
Why , this is above Ela ? But how comes this ?
Nay that 's to understand yet , But thus it is , and this part but the poorest , 'Twould make a man leap over the Moon to see him act these .
With sighs as though his heart would break : Cry like a breech 'd boy , not eat a bit .
I must go see him presently , For this is such a gig , for certain , Gentlemen , The Fiend rides on a Fiddle-stick .
I think so .
Can ye guide me to him for half an hour ? I am hisTo see the miracle .
We sure shall start him. [ Exeunt .
Are you sure she drank it ?
Now must I lye most confidently.Yes Sir , she has drunk it off .
How works it with her ?
I see no alteration yet .
There will be , For he is the greatest Artist living made it.Where is she now ?
She is ready to walk out , Sir .
Stark mad , I know she will be .
So I hope , Sir .
She knows not of the Prince ?
Of no man living --
How do I look ? how do my cloaths become me ? I am not very grey .
A very youth , Sir , Upon my maiden-head as smug as April : Heaven bless that sweet face , 'twill undo a thousand ; Many a soft heart must sob yet , e'r that wither , Your Grace can give content enough .
I think so .
Here she comes , Sir .
How shall I keep her off me ? Go , & perfume the room : make all things ready. [ Ex. Leu .
No hope yet of the Prince ! no comfort of him ! They keep me mew 'd up here , as they mew mad folks , No company but my afflictions.This royal Devil again ! strange , how he haunts me ! How like a poyson 'd potion his eyes fright me ! Has made himself handsome too .
Do you look now , Lady ? You will leap anon .
Curl 'd and perfum 'd ? I smell him ; He looks on 's legs too , sure he will cut a caper ; God-a-mercy , dear December .
O do you smile now ; I knew it would work with you ; come hither pretty one .
Sir .
I like those courtesies well ; come hither and kiss me .
I am reading , Sir , of a short Treatise here , That 's call 'd the Vanity of Lust : has your Grace seen it ? He says here , that an Old Mans loose desireIs like the Glow-worms light , the Apes so wonder 'd at : Which when they gather 'd sticks , and laid upo n't , And blew , and blew , turn 'd tail , and went out presently : And in another place he calls their loves , Faint Smells of dying Flowers , carry no comforts ; They 're doting , stinking foggs , so thick and muddy , Reason with all his beams can not beat through 'em .
How 's this ? is this the potion ? you but fool still ; I know you love me .
As you are just and honest ; I know I love and honour you : admire you .
This makes against me , fearfully against me .
But as you bring your power to persecute me , Your traps to catch mine innocence to rob me , As you lay out your lusts to overwhelm me , Hell never hated good , as I hate you , Sir ; And I dare tell it to your face : What gloryNow after all your Conquests got , your Titles , The ever-living memories rais 'd to you , Can my defeat be ? my poor wrack , what triumph ? And when you crown your swelling Cups to fortune , What honourable tongue can sing my story ? Be as your Emblem is , a g [ l ] orious LampSet on the top of all , to light all perfectly : Be as your office is , a god-like Justice , Into all shedding equally your Vertues .
She has drencht me now ; now I admire her goodness ; So young , so nobly strong , I never tasted : Can nothing in the power of Kings perswade ye ?
No , nor that power command me .
Say I should force ye ? I have it in my will .
Your will 's a poor one ; And though it be a King 's Will , a despised one.Weaker than Infants legs , your will 's in swadling Clouts , A thousand ways my will has found to check ye ; A thousand doors to 'scape ye , I dare dye , Sir ; As suddenly I dare dye , as you can offer : Nay , say you had your Will , say you had ravish 'd me , Perform 'd your lust , what had you purchas 'd by it ? What Honour won ? do you know who dwells above , Sir , And what they have prepar 'd for men turn 'd Devils ? Did you never hear their thunder ? start and tremble , Death sitting on your bloud , when their fires visit us.Will nothing wring you then do you think ? sit hard here , And like a Snail curl round about your Conscience , Biting and stinging : will you not roar too late then ? Then when you shake in horrour of this Villainy , Then will I rise a Star in Heaven , and scorn ye .
Lust , how I hate thee now ! and love this sweetness ! Will you be my Queen ? can that price purchase ye ?
Not all the World , I am a Queen already , Crown 'd by his Love , I must not lose for Fortune ; I can give none away , sell none away , Sir , Can lend no love , am not mine own Exchequer ; For in anothers heart my hope and peace lies .
Your fair hands , Lady ? for yet I am not pure enoughTo touch these Lips , in that sweet Peace ye spoke of.Live now for ever , and I to serve your Vertues --
Why now you show a god ! now I kneel to ye ; This Sacrifice of Virgins Joy send to ye : Thus I hold up my hands to Heaven that touch 'd ye , And pray eternal Blessings dwell about ye .
Vertue commands the Stars : rise more than Vertue ; Your present comfort shall be now my business .
All my obedient service wait upon ye. [ Ex. severally .
Hast thou clean forgot the Wars ?
Prithee hold thy peace .
His mind 's much elevated now .
It seems so.Sirrah .
I am so troubled with this Fellow .
He will call me Rogue anon .
'T is ten to one else .
O King that thou knew'st I lov 'd thee , how I lov 'd thee.And where O King , I barrel up thy beauty .
He can not leave his Sutlers trade , he woos i n't .
O never , King .
By this hand , when I consider --
My honest friend , you are a little sawcy .
I told you you would have it .
When mine own worth --
Is flung into the ballance , and found nothing .
And yet a Soldier .
And yet a sawcy one .
One that has followed thee .
Fair and far off .
Fought for thy grace .
'T was for some grief , you lye Sir .
He 's the son of a whore denies this : will that satisfie ye ?
Yes , very well .
Shall then that thing that honours thee ? How miserable a thing soever , yet a thing still ; And though a thing of nothing , thy thing ever .
Here 's a new thing .
He 's in a deep dump now .
I'le fetch him out on't. When 's the King 's birth-day ?
When e 're it be , that day I'le dye with ringing.And there 's the resolution of a Lover. [ Exit .
A goodly resolution sure I take it.He is bewitch 'd , or moop 'd , or his brains melted , Could he find no body to fall in love with ; but the King , The good old King , to doat upon him too ? Stay , now I remember , what the fat woman warn 'd me , Bid me remember , and look to him too : I'le hang if she have not a hand in this : he 's conjured , Goe after him , I pity the poor Rascal , In the mean time I'le wait occasionTo work upon the Prince .
Pray doe that seriously. [ Ex. severally .
He 's very ill .
I am very sorry for't , And much ashamed I have wronged her innocence,
, guide her to the Princes lodgings , There leave her to his love again .
I am glad Sir .
He will speak to none .
O I shall break that silence ; Be quick , take fair attendance .
Yes Sir presently. [ Exit .
He will find his tongue , I warrant ye ; his health too ; I send a physick will not fail .
Fair work it .
We hear the Princes mean to visit usIn way of truce .
'T is thought so .
Come : let 's in then , And think upon the noblest wayes to meet 'em. [ Exeunt .
There 's no way now to get in : all the light stopt too ; Nor can I hear a sound of him , pray HeavenHe use no violence : I think he has more Soul , Stronger , and I hope nobler : would I could but see once , This beauty he groans under , or come to knowBut any circumstance. What noise is that there ? I think I heard him groan : here are some coming ; A woman too , I'le stand aloof , and view 'em .
Well , some of ye have been to blame in this point , But I forgive ye : The King might have pickt out tooSome fitter woman to have tri 'd his valour .
'T was all to the best meant , Lady .
I must think so , For how to mend it now : he 's here you tell me ?
He 's Madam , and the joy to see you onlyWill draw him out .
I know that womans tongue , I think I have seen her face too : I'le goe nearer : If this be she , he has some cause of sorrow : 'T is the same face ; the same , most excellent woman .
This should be Lord Leontius : I remember him .
Lady , I think ye know me .
Speak soft , good Souldier : I do , and know ye worthy , know ye noble ; Know not me yet openly , as you love me ; But let me see ye again , I'le satisfie ye : I am wondrous glad to see those eyes .
You have charged me .
You shall know where I am .
I will not off yet : She goes to knock at 's door : This must be sheThe fellow told me of : right glad I am o n't , He will bolt now for certain .
Are ye within Sir ? I'le trouble you no more : I thank your courtesie , Pray leave me now .
Me. We rest your humble servants. [ Ex. Me. & c .
So now my jives are off : pray Heaven he be here ! Master , my royal Sir : do you hear who calls ye ? Love , my Demetrius .
These are pretty quail-pipes , The Cock will Crow anon .
Can ye be drowsie , When I call at your Window ?
I hear him stirring : Now he comes wondring out .
'T is Celias sound sure : The sweetness of that tongue draws all hearts to it ; There stands the shape too .
How he stares upon her !
Ha ? do mine eyes abuse me ? 'T is she , the living Celia : your hand Lady ?
What should this mean ?
The very self same Celia .
How do ye Sir ?
Only turn 'd brave.I heard you were dead my dear one , compleat , She is wondrous brave , a wondrous gallant Courtier .
How he surveyes me round ? here has been foul play .
How came she thus ?
It was a kind of death Sir , I suffered in your absence , mew 'd up here , And kept conceal 'd I know not how .
'T is likely : How came you hither Celia ? wondrous gallant : Did my Father send for ye ?
So they told me Sir , And on command too .
I hope you were obedient ?
I was so ever .
And ye were bravely us 'd ?
I wanted nothing : My maiden-head to a mote i'th ' Sun , he 's jealous : I must now play the knave with him , though I dye for't , 'T is in my nature .
Her very eyes are alter 'd : Jewels , and rich ones too , I never saw yet -- And what were those came for ye ?
Monstrous jealous : Have I liv 'd at the rate of these scorn 'd questions ? They seem 'd of good sort , Gentlemen .
Kind men ?
They were wondrous kind : I was much beholding to 'em ; There was one Menippus Sir .
Ha ?
One Menippus , A notable merry Lord , and a good companion .
And one Charinthus too ?
Yes , there was such a one .
And Timon ?
'T is most true .
And thou most treacherous : My Fathers bawds by -- -- they never miss course ; And were these daily with ye ?
Every hour Sir .
And was there not a Lady , a fat Lady ?
O yes ; a notable good wench .
The Devil fetch her .
'T is ev'n the merriest wench --
Did she keep with ye too ?
She was all in all ; my bed-fellow , eat with me , Brought me acquainted .
You are well know [ n ] here then ?
There is no living here a stranger I think .
How came ye by this brave gown ?
This is a poor one : Alas , I have twenty richer : do you see these jewels ? Why , they are the poorest things , to those are sent me , And sent me hourly too .
Is there no modestie ? No faith in this fair Sex ?
What will this prove too ? For yet with all my wits , I understand not .
Come hither ; thou art dead indeed , lost , tainted ; All that I left thee fair , and innocent , Sweet as thy youth , and carrying comfort i n't ; All that I hoped for vertuous , is fled from thee , Turn 'd black , and bankrupt .
'By'r Lady , this cuts shrewdly .
Thou art dead , for ever dead ; sins surfeit slew thee ; The ambition of those wanton eyes betrai 'd thee ; Go from me , grave of honour ; go thou foul one , Thou glory of thy sin ; go thou despis 'd one , And where there is no vertue , nor no virgin ; Where Chastity was never known , nor heard of ; Where nothing reigns but impious lust , and looser faces.Go thither , child of bloud , and sing my doating .
You do not speak this seriously I hope Sir ; I did but jest with you .
Look not upon me , There is more hell in those eyes , than hell harbours ; And when they flame , more torments .
Dare ye trust me ? You durst once even with all you had : your love Sir ? By this fair light I am honest .
Thou subtle Circe , Cast not upon the maiden light eclipses : Curse not the day .
Come , come , you shall not do this : How fain you would seem angry now , to fright me ; You are not in the field among your Enemies ; Come , I must cool this courage .
Out thou impudence , Thou ulcer of thy Sex ; when I first saw thee , I drew into mine eyes mine own destruction , I pull 'd into my heart that sudden poyson , That now consumes my dear content to cinders : I am not now Demetrius , thou hast chang 'd me ; Thou , woman , with thy thousand wiles hast chang 'd me ; Thou Serpent with thy angel-eyes hast slain me ; And where , before I touch 'd on this fair ruine , I was a man , and reason made , and mov 'd me , Now one great lump of grief , I grow and wander .
And as you are noble , do you think I did this ?
Put all the Devils wings on , and flie from me .
I will go from ye , never more to see ye : I will flie from ye , as a plague hangs o 're me ; And through the progress of my life hereafter ; Where ever I shall find a fool , a false man , One that ne 're knew the worth of polish 'd vertue ; A base suspecter of a virgins honour , A child that flings away the wealth he cri 'd for , Him will I call Demetrius : that fool Demetrius , That mad man a Demetrius ; and that false man , The Prince of broken faiths , even Prince Demetrius.You think now , I should cry , and kneel down to ye , Petition for my peace ; let those that feel hereThe weight of evil , wait for such a favour , I am above your hate , as far above it , In all the actions of an innocent life , As the pure Stars are from the muddy meteors , Cry when you know your folly : howl and curse then , Beat that unmanly breast , that holds a false heartWhen ye shall come to know , whom ye have flung from ye .
Pray ye stay a little .
Not your hopes can alter me.Then let a thousand black thoughts muster in ye , And with those enter in a thousand doatings ; Those eyes be never shut , but drop to nothing : My innocence for ever haunt and fright ye : Those arms together grow in folds ; that tongue , That bold bad tongue that barks out these disgraces.When you shall come to know how nobly vertuousI have preserv 'd my life , rot , rot within ye .
What shall I doe ?
Live a lost man for ever.Go ask your Fathers conscience what I suffered , And through what seas of hazards I sayl 'd through : Mine honour still advanced in spight of tempests , Then take your leave of love ; and confess freely , You were never worthy of this heart that serv 'd ye , And so farewel ungratefull -- [ Exit .
Is she gone ?
I'le follow her , and will find out this matter. -- [ Exit .
Antigonus , and Lords .
Are ye pleas 'd now ? have you got your heart again ? Have I restor 'd ye that ?
Sir even for Heaven sake , And sacred truth sake , tell me how ye found her .
I will , and in few words. Before I tri 'd her , 'T is true , I thought her most unfit your fellowship , And fear 'd her too : which fear begot that storyI told ye first : but since , like gold I toucht her .
And how dear Sir ?
Heavens holy light 's not purer : The constancy and goodness of all womenThat ever liv 'd , to win the names of worthy , This noble Maid has doubled in her : honour , All promises of wealth , all art to win her , And by all tongues imploy 'd , wrought as much on herAs one may doe upon the Sun at noon dayBy lighting Candles up : her shape is heavenly , And to that heavenly shape her thoughts are angels .
Why did you tell me Sir ?
'T is true , I err 'd i n't : But since I made a full proof of her vertue , I find a King too poor a servant for her.Love her , and honour her ; in all observe her.She must be something more than time yet tells her : And certain I believe him b [ l ] est , enjoyes her : I would not lose the hope of such a Daughter , To adde another Empire to my honour. -- [ Exit .
O wretched state ! to what end shall I turn me ? And where begins my penance ? now , what serviceWill win her love again ? my death must doe it : And if that sacrifice can purge my follies , Be pleas 'd , O mightie Love , I dye thy servant -- [ Exit .
Leontius , and Celia .
I know he do 's not deserve ye ; h'as us 'd you poorly : And to redeem himself --
Redeem ?
I know it -- There 's no way left .
For Heavens sake do not name him , Do not think on him Sir , he 's so far from meIn all my thoughts now , methinks I never knew him .
But yet I would see him again .
No , never , never .
I do not mean to lend him any comfort ; But to afflict him , so to torture him ; That even his very Soul may shake within him : To make him know , though he be great and powerfull , 'T is not within his aim to deal dishonourably , And carry it off ; and with a maid of your sort .
I must confess , I could most spightfully afflict him ; Now , now , I could whet my anger at him ; Now arm 'd with bitterness , I could shoot through him ; I long to vex him .
And doe it home , and bravely .
Were I a man !
I'le help that weakness in ye : I honour ye , and serve ye .
Not only to disclaim me , When he had seal 'd his vowes in Heaven , sworn to me , And poor believing I became his servant : But most maliciously to brand my credit , Stain my pure name .
I would not suffer it : See him I would again , and to his teeth too : Od 's precious , I would ring him such a lesson --
I have done that already .
Nothing , nothing : It was too poor a purge ; besides , by this timeHe has found his fault , and feels the hells that follow it.That , and your urg 'd on anger to the highest , Why , 'twill be such a stroak --
Say he repent then , And seek with tears to soften , I am a woman ; A woman that have lov 'd him , Sir , have honour 'd him : I am no more .
Why , you may deal thereafter .
If I forgive him , I am lost .
Hold there then , The sport will be to what a poor submission -- But keep you strong .
I would not see him .
Yes , You shall Ring his knell .
How if I kill him ?
Kill him ? why , let him dye .
I know 't is fit so.But why should I that lov 'd him once , destroy him ? O had he scap't this sin , what a brave Gentleman --
I must confess , had this not faln , a nobler , A handsomer , the whole world had not show 'd ye : And to his making such a mind --
'T is certain : But all this I must now forget .
You shall notIf I have any art : goe up sweet Lady , And trust my truth .
But good Sir bring him not .
I would not for the honour ye are born to , But you shall see him , and neglect him too , and scorn him .
You will be near me then .
I will be with ye ; Yet there 's some hope to stop this gap , I'le work hard. [ Ex .
But is it possible this fellow took it ?
It seems so by the violence it wrought with , Yet now the fits ev'n off .
I beseech your Grace .
Nay , I forgive thy wife with all my heart , And am right glad she drank it not her self , And more glad that the vertuous maid escap't it , I would not for the world 'thad hit : but that this Souldier , Lord how he looks , that he should take this vomit ; Can he make rimes too ?
H'as made a thousand Sir , And plaies the burthen to 'em on a Jews-trump,
He looks as though he were bepist : do you love me Sir ?
Yes surely even with all my heart .
I thank ye ; I am glad I have so good a subject : but pray ye tell me , How much did ye love me , before ye drank this matter ?
Even as much as a sober man might ; and a SouldierThat your grace owes just half a years pay to .
Well remembred ; And did I seem so young and amiable to ye ?
Methought you were the sweetest youth --
That 's excellent .
I truly Sir : and ever as I thought on ye , I wished , and wished --
What didst thou wish prethee ?
Ev'n , that I had been a wench of fifteen for ye , A handsom wench Sir .
Why ? God a Mercy Souldier : I seem not so now to thee .
Not all out : And yet I have a grudging to your grace still .
Thou wast never in love before ?
Not with a King , And hope I shall never be again : Truly Sir , I have had such plunges , and such bickrings , And as it were such runnings atilt within me , For whatsoever it was provok't me toward ye .
God a-mercy still .
I had it with a vengeance , It plaid his prize .
I would not have been a wench then , Though of this age .
No sure , I should have spoil 'd ye .
Well , goe thy waies , of all the lusty loversThat e 're I saw -- wilt have another potion ?
If you will be another thing , have at ye .
Ha , ha , ha : give me thy hand , from henceforth thou art my souldier , Do bravely , I'le love thee as much .
I thank ye ; But if you were mine enemy , I would not wish it ye : I beseech your Grace , pay me my charge .
That 's certain Sir ; Ha 's bought up all that e 're he found was like ye , Or any thing you have lov 'd , that he could purchase ; Old horses , that your Grace has ridden blind , and foundr 'd ; Dogs , rotten hawks , and which is more than all this , Has worn your Grace 's Gauntlet in his Bonnet .
Bring in your Bills : mine own love shall be satisfi 'd ; And sirrah , for this potion you have taken , I'le point ye out a portion ye shall live on .
'T was the best draught that e 're ye drunk .
I hope so .
Are the Princes come to th ' Court ?
They are all , and lodg 'd Sir .
Come then , make ready for their entertainment , Which presently we'l give : wait you on me Sir .
I shall love drink the better whilst I live boyes. [ Exeunt .
Let me but see her , dear Leontius ; Let me but dye before her .
Would that would doe it : If I knew where she lay now , with what honestie , You having flung so main a mischief on her , And on so innocent and sweet a Beauty , Dare I present your visit ?
I'le repent all : And with the greatest sacrifice of sorrow , That ever Lover made .
'Twill be too late Sir : I know not what will become of you .
You can help me .
It may be to her sight : what are you nearer ? She has sworn she will not speak to ye , look upon ye , And to love ye again , O she cries out , and thunders , She had rather love -- there is no hope --
Yes Leontius , There is a hope , which though it draw no love to it , At least will draw her to lament my fortune , And that hope shall relieve me .
Hark ye Sir , hark ye : Say I should bring ye --
Do [ not ] trifle with me ?
I will not trifle ; both together bring ye , You know the wrongs ye ' done .
I do confess 'em .
And if you should then jump into your fury , And have another querk in your head .
I'le dye first .
You must say nothing to her ; for 't is certain , The nature of your crime will admit [ no ] excuse .
I will not speak , mine eyes shall tell my penance .
You must look wondrous sad too .
I need not look so , I am truly sadness self .
That look will do it : Stay here , I'le bring her to you instantly : But take heed how you bear your self : sit down there , The more humble you are , the more she'l take compassion.Women are per'lous thing [ s ] to deal upon. [ Exit .
What shall become of me ? to curse my fortune , Were but to curse my Father ; that 's too impious ; But under whatsoever fate I suffer , Bless I beseech thee heaven her harmless goodness .
Now arm your self .
You have not brought him ?
Yes faith , And there he is : you see in what poor plight too , Now you may doe your will , kill him , or save him .
I will goe back .
I will be hang 'd then Lady , Are ye a coward now ?
I can not speak to him .
O me .
There was a sigh to blow a Church down ; So , now their eyes are fixt , the small shot playes , They will come to th ' batterie anon .
He weeps extreamly .
Rail at him now .
I dare not .
I am glad o n't .
Nor dare believe his tears .
You may , blest beauty , For those thick streams that troubled my repentance , Are crept out long agoe .
You see how he looks .
What have I to doe how he looks ? how lookt he then , When with a poisoned tooth he bit mine honour ? It was your counsel too , to scorn and slight him .
I , if ye saw fit cause ; and you confest too , Except this sin , he was the bravest Gentleman , The sweetest , noblest : I take nothing from ye , Nor from your anger ; use him as you please : For to say truth , he has deserved your justice ; But still consider what he has been to you .
Pray do not blind me thus .
O Gentle Mistris , If there were any way to expiateA sin so great as mine , by intercession , By prayers , by daily tears , by dying for ye : O what a joy would close these eyes that love ye .
They say women have tender hearts , I know not , I am sure mine melts .
Sir , I forgive ye heartily , And all your wrong to me I cast behind me , And wish ye a fit beauty to your vertues : Mine is too poor , in peace I part thus from you ; I must look back : gods keep your grace : he 's here still. [ Ex .
She has forgiven me .
She has directed ye : Up , up , and follow like a man : away Sir , She lookt behind her twice : her heart dwells here Sir , Ye drew tears from her too : she can not freeze thus ; The door 's set open too , are ye a man ? Are ye alive ? do ye understand her meaning ? Have ye bloud and spirit in ye ?
I dare not trouble her .
Nay , and you will be nip't i'th ' head with nothing , Walk whining up and down ; I dare not , I can not : Strike now or never : faint heart , you know what Sir -- Be govern 'd by your fear , and quench your fire out.A Devil o n't , stands this door ope for nothing ? So get ye together , and be naught : now to secure all , Will I go fetch out a more soveraign plaister. [ Exeunt .
Enter Antigonus , Seleucus , Lysimachus , Ptolomy , Lieutenant , Gentlemen , Lords .
This peace is fairly made .
Would your Grace wish usTo put in more : take what you please , we yield it ; The honour done us by your son constrains it , Your noble son .
It is sufficient , Princes ; And now we are one again , one mind , one body , And one sword shall strike for us .
Let Prince DemetriusBut lead us on : for we are his vowed servants ; Against the strength of all the world we'l buckle .
And even from all that strength we'l catch at victory .
O had I now recover 'd but the fortuneI lost in Antioch , when mine Unckle perish 'd ; But that were but to surfeit me with blessings .
You lost a sweet child there .
Name it no more Sir ; This is no time to entertain such sorrows ; Will your Majesty do us the honour , we may see the Prince , And wait upon him ?
I wonder he stayes from us : How now Leontius , where 's my son ?
Brave Captain .
Old valiant Sir .
Your Graces are welcom : Your son and't please you Sir , is new cashiered yonder , Cast from his Mistris favour : and such a coil there is ; Such fending , and such proving ; she stands off , And will by no means yield to composition : He offers any price ; his body to her .
She is a hard Lady , denies that caution .
And now they whine , and now they rave : faith Princes , 'Twere a good point of charity to piece 'em ; For less than such a power will doe just nothing : And if you mean to see him , there it must be , For there will he grow , till he be transplanted .
Beseech your grace , let 's wait upon you thither , That I may see that beauty dares deny him , That scornfull beauty .
I should think it worse now ; Ill brought up beauty .
She has too much reason for't ; Which with too great a grief , I shame to think of , But we 'll go see this game .
Rather this wonder .
Be you our guide Leontius , here 's a new peace. [ Ex .
Thus far you shall perswade me , still to honour ye , Still to live with ye , Sir , or near about ye ; For not to lye , you have my first and last love : But since you have conceiv 'd an evil against me , An evil that so much concerns your honour , That honour aim 'd by all at for a pattern : And though there be a false thought , and confest too , And much repentance faln in showrs to purge it ; Yet , whilest that great respect I ever bore ye , Dwells in my bloud , and in my heart that duty ; Had it but been a dream , I must not touch ye .
O you will make some other happy ?
Never , Upon this hand I'le seal that faith .
We may kiss , Put not those out o'th ' peace too .
Those I'le give ye , So there you will be pleas 'd to pitch your ne ultra , I will be merry with ye ; sing , discourse with ye , Be your poor Mistris still : in truth I love ye.Enter Leontius , Antigonus , Seleucus , Lysimachus , Ptolomie , Lieutenant , and Gentleman .
Stay , who are these ?
A very handsom Lady .
As e 're you saw .
Pity her heart 's so cruel .
How does your Grace ? he stands still , will not hear us .
We come to serve ye , Sir , in all our fortunes .
He bows a little now ; he 's strangely alter 'd .
Ha ? pray ye a word Leontius , pray ye a word with ye,
? you bo'th knew mine Enanthe , I lost in Antioch , when the Town was taken , Mine Uncle slain , Antigonus had the sack o n't ?
Yes , I remember well the Girl .
Methinks nowThat face is wondrous like her : I have her picture , The same , but more years on her ; the very same .
A Cherry to a Chery is not liker .
Look on her eyes .
Most certain she is like her : Many a time have I dandled her in these arms , Sir , And I hope who will more .
What 's that ye look at , Pr [ in ] ces ?
This Picture , and that Lady , Sir .
Ha ! they are near : They only err in time .
Did you mark that blush there ? That came the nearest .
I must speak to her .
You 'll quickly be resolved .
Your name sweet Lady ?
Enanthe , Sir : and this to beg your blessing .
Do you know me ?
If you be the King Seleucus , I know you are my Father .
Peace a little , Where did I lose ye ?
At the Sack of Antioch , Where my good Unckle di 'd , and I was taken , By a mean Souldier taken : by this Prince , This noble Prince , redeem 'd from him again , Where ever since I have remain 'd his Servant .
My joys are now too full : welcome Enanthe , Mine own , my dearest , and my best Enanthe .
And mine too desperate .
You shall not think so , This is a peace indeed .
I hope it shall be , And ask it first .
Most Royal Sir , ye have it .
I once more beg it thus .
You must not be deny 'd , Sir .
By me , I am sure he must not : sure he shall not ; Kneeling I give it too ; kneeling I take it ; And from this hour , no envious spight e 're part us .
The gods give happy joyes ; all comforts to ye .
My new Enanthe .
Come , beat all the Drums up , And all the noble instruments of War : Let 'em fill all the Kingdom with their sound , And those the brazen Arch of Heaven break through , While to the Temple we conduct these two .
May they be ever loving , ever young , And ever worthy of those lines they sprung ; May their fair issues walk with time along .
She must be known & suddenly ; when you have doneCome in and take your leave sir , and some fewPrayers along .
[ sic ] Do ye know her ?
No , beleeve sir .
Did you observe her Tymon ?
I look 'd on her , But what she is --
I must have that found .

is printed entirely in prose in the Second Folio , andI have therefore printed in the Appendix the play in verse , as it appearedin the First Quarto. The case is an interesting one , and readers will beglad , I think , to have both forms in the same volume.I have not concerned myself with passages in the Second Folio in prosewhich have since been printed as verse. On the whole I agree with a recentcritic who characterises as 'vexatious ' the 'later practice of printingmuch manifest prose as verse , each post-seventeenth century editorapparently making it a point of honour to discover metre where no one hadfound it before , and where no one with an ear can find it now.'I am glad to have had the opportunity of seeing the 1625 manuscript of
Wouldst thou all Wit , all Comick Art survey ? Read here and wonder ; Fletcher writ the Play .
Lewis , Angellina , and Sylvia .
Nay , I must walk you farther .
I am tir 'd , Sir , and ne'er shall foot it home .
'T is for your health ; the want of exercise takes from yourBeauties , and sloth dries up your sweetness : That you are my only Daughterand my Heir , is granted ; and you in thankfulness must needs acknowledge , you ever find me an indulgent Father , and open handed .
Nor can you tax me , Sir , I hope , for want of duty to deserve thesefavours from you .
No , my Angellina , I love and cherish thy obedience to me , whichmy care to advance thee shall confirm : all that I aim at , is , to win theefrom the practice of an idle foolish state , us 'd by great Women , who thinkany labour ( though in the service of themselves ) a blemish to their fairfortunes .
Make me understand , Sir , what 't is you point at .
At the custom , how Virgins of wealthy Families waste their youth ; after a long sleep , when you wake , your Woman presents your Breakfast , then you sleep again , then rise , and being trimm 'd up by other hands , y'are led to Dinner , and that ended , either to Cards or to your Couch , ( asif you were born without motion ) after this to Supper , and then to Bed : and so your life runs round without variety or action , Daughter .
Here 's a learned Lecture !
Fro [ m ] this idleness , Diseases , both in body and in mind , growstrong upon you ; where a stirring nature , with wholesome exercise , guardsboth from danger : I 'd have thee rise with the Sun , walk , dance , or hunt , visit the Groves and Springs , and learn the vertue of Plants and Simples : Do this moderately , and thou shalt not , with eating Chalk , or Coles , Leather and Oatmeal , and such other trash , fall into the Green-sickness .
With your pardon ( were you but pleas 'd to minister it ) I couldprescribe a Remedy for my Lady 's health , and her delight too , fartranscending those your Lordship but now mention 'd .
What is it , Sylvia ?
What is't ! a noble Husband ; in that word , a noble Husband , allcontent of Woman is wholly comprehended ; He will rouse her , as you say , with the Sun ; and so pipe to her , as she will dance , ne'er doubt it ; andhunt with her , upon occasion , until both be weary ; and then the knowledgeof your Plants and Simples , as I take it , were superfluous. A loving , and , but add to it , a gamesome Bedfellow , being the sure Physician .
Well said , Wench .
And who gave you Commission to deliver your Verdict , Minion ?
I deserve a Fee , and not a frown , dear Madam : I but speak herthoughts , my Lord , and what her modesty refuses to give voice to. Shew nomercy to a Maidenhead of fourteen , but off with't : let her lose no time , Sir ; Fathers that deny their Daughters lawful pleasures , when ripe forthem , in some kinds edge their appetites to taste of the fruit that isforbidden .
'T is well urg 'd , and I approve it : No more blushing , Girl , thyWoman hath spoke truth , and so prevented what I meant to move to thee.There dwells near us a Gentleman of bloud , Monsieur Brisac , of a fairEstate , six thousand Crowns per annum , the happy Father of two hopefulSons , of different breeding ; the Elder , a meer Scholar ; the younger , aquaint Courtier .
Sir , I know them by publick fame , though yet I never saw them ; andthat oppos 'd antipathy between their various dispositions , renders themthe general discourse and argument ; one part inclining to the Scholar
, the other side preferring Eustace , as a man compleat inCourtship .
And which way ( if of these two you were to chuse a Husband ) dothyour affection sway you ?
To be plain Sir , ( since you will teach me boldness ) as they aresimply themselves , to neither : let a Courtier be never so exact , let himbe bless 'd with all parts that yield him to a Virgin gracious ; if hedepend on others , and stand not on his own bottoms , though he have themeans to bring his Mistris to a Masque , or by conveyance from some greatones lips , to taste such favour from the King : or grant he purchaseprecedency in the Court , to be sworn a servant Extraordinary to the Queen ; nay , though he live in expectation of some huge preferment in reversion ; if he want a present fortune , at the best those are but glorious dreams , and only yield him a happiness in posse , not in esse ; nor can theyfetch him Silks from the Mercer , nor discharge a Tailors Bill , nor in fullplenty ( which still preserves a quiet Bed at home ) maintain a Family .
Aptly consider 'd , and to my wish : But what 's thy censure of theScholar ?
Troth ( if he be nothing else ) as of the Courtier , all his Songs andSonnets , his Anagrams , Acrosticks , Epigrams , his deep and PhilosophicalDiscourse of Nature 's hidden Secrets , makes not up a perfect Husband ; hecan hardly borrow the Stars of the Celestial Crown to make me a Tire formy Head , nor Charles 's Wain for a Coach , nor Ganymede for a Page , nora rich Gown from Juno 's Wardrobe , nor would I lie in ( for I despair notonce to be a Mother ) under Heaven 's spangled Canopy , or Banquet my Guestsand Gossips with imagin 'd Nectar ; pure Orleans would do better : No , no , Father , though I could be well pleas 'd to have my Husband a Courtier , anda Scholar , young , and valiant ; these are but gawdy nothings , if there benot something to make a substance .
And what is that ?
A full Estate , and that said , I 've said all ; and get me such a onewith these Additions , farwel Virginity , and welcome Wedlock .
But where is such a one to be met with , Daughter ? A black Swan ismore common ; you may wear grey Tresses e 're we find him .
I am not so punctual in all Ceremonies , I will 'bate two or threeof these good parts , before I'le dwell too long upon the choice .
Only , my Lord , remember , that he be rich and active , for withoutthese , the others yield no relish , but these perfect. You must bear withsmall faults , Madam .
Merry Wench , and it becomes you well ; I'le to Brisac , and trywhat may be done ; i'th ' mean time home , and feast thy thoughts withth'pleasures of a Bride .
Thoughts are but airy food , Sir , let her taste them.ACTUS I. SCENA II .
Andrew , Cook , and Butler .
Unload part of the Library , and make room for th'other dozen ofCarts ; I'le straight be with you .
Why , hath he more Books ?
More than ten Marts send over .
And can he tell their names ?
Their names ! he has 'em as perfect as his Pater Noster ; butthat 's nothing , h'as read them over leaf by leaf three thousand times ; buthere 's the wonder , though their weight would sink a Spanish Carrock , without other Ballast , he carrieth them all in his head , and yet he walksupright .
Surely he has a strong brain .
If all thy pipes of Wine were fill 'd with Books , made of the Barksof Trees , or Mysteries writ in old moth-eaten Vellam , he would sip thyCellar quite dry , and still be thirsty : Then for 's Diet , he eats anddigests more Volumes at a meal , than there would be Larks ( though the Skyshould fall ) devoured in a month in Paris. Yet fear not Sons o'theButtery and Kitchin , though his learn 'd stomach can not be appeas 'd ; he'llseldom trouble you , his knowing stomach contemns your Black-jacks,
, and your Flagons ; and Cook , thy Boil 'd , thy Rost , thy Bak 'd .
How liveth he ?
Not as other men do , few Princes fare like him ; he breaks his fastwith Aristotle , dines with Tully , takes his watering with the Muses , sups with Livy , then walks a turn or two in Via Lactea , and ( after sixhours conference with the Stars ) sleeps with old Erra Pater .
This is admirable .
I'le tell you more hereafter. Here 's my old Master , and another oldignorant Elder ; I'le upon 'em .
Brisac , Lewis .
What , Andrew ? welcome ; where 's my Charles ? speak , Andrew , where did'st thou leave thy Master ?
Contemplating the number of the Sands in the Highway , and fromthat , purposes to make a Judgment of the remainder in the Sea : he is , Sir , in serious study , and will lose no minute , nor out of 's pace to knowledge .
This is strange .
Yet he hath sent his duty , Sir , before him in this fair Manuscript .
What have we here ? Pot-hooks and Andirons !
I much pity you , it is the Syrian Character , or the Arabick. Wouldyou have it said , so great and deep a Scholar as Mr Charles is , shouldask blessing in any Christian Language ? Were it Greek I could interpretfor you , but indeed I 'm gone no farther .
And in Greek you can lie with your smug Wife Lilly .
If I keep her from your French Dialect , as I hope I shall , Sir ; however she is your Landress , she shall put you to the charge of no moreSoap than usual for th'washing of your Sheets .
Take in the Knave , and let him eat .
And drink too , Sir .
And drink too Sir , and see your Masters Chamber ready for him .
Come , Dr Andrew , without Disputation thou shalt Commence i'theCellar .
I had rather Commence on a cold Bak 'd meat .
Thou shalt ha't , Boy .
Good Monsieur Lewis , I esteem my self much honour 'd in your clearintent , to joyn our ancient Families , and make them one ; and 'twill takefrom my age and cares , to live and see what you have purpos 'd but in act , of which your visit at this present is a hopeful Omen ; I each minuteexpecting the arrival of my Sons ; I have not wrong 'd their Birth for wantof Means and Education , to shape them to that course each was addicted ; and therefore that we may proceed discreetly , since what 's concludedrashly seldom prospers , you first shall take a strict perusal of them , andthen from your allowance , your fair Daughter m [ a ] y fashion her affection .
Monsieur Brisac , you offer fair and nobly , and I'le meet you inthe same line of Honour ; and I hope , being blest but with one Daughter , Ishall not appear impertinently curious , though with my utmost vigilanceand study , I labour to bestow her to her worth : Let others speak her form , and future Fortune from me descending to her ; I in that sit down withsilence .
You may , my Lord , securely , since Fame aloud proclaimeth herperfections , commanding all mens tongues to sing her praises ; should I saymore , you well might censure me ( what yet I never was ) a Flatterer. Whattrampling 's that without of Horses ?
Butler .
Sir , my young Masters are newly alighted .
Sir , now observe their several dispositions .
Charles .
Bid my Supsiser carry my Hackney to the Butt'ry , and give him hisBever ; it is a civil and sober Beast , and will drink moderately ; and thatdone , turn him into the Quadrangle .
He can not out of his University tone .
Eustace , Egremont , Cowsy .
Lackey , take care our Coursers be well rubb 'd , and cloath 'd ; theyhave out-stripp 'd the Wind in speed .
I marry , Sir , there 's metal in this young Fellow ! What a Sheep'slook his elder Brother has !
Your blessing , Sir .
Rise , Charles , thou hast it .
Sir , though it be unusual in the Court , ( since 't is the Courtiersgarb ) I bend my knee , and do expert what follows .
Courtly begg'd. My blessing , take it .
Your Lordship 's vow 'd adorer. What a thing this Brotheris ! yet I'le vouchsafe him the new Italian shrug -- How clownishly the Book-worm does return it !
I 'm glad ye are well. [ Reads .
Pray you be happy in the knowledge of this pair of accomplish'dMonsieurs ; they are Gallants that have seen both Tropicks .
I embrace their love .
Which we 'll repay with servulating .
And will report your bounty in the Court .
I pray you make deserving use o n't first. Eustace , giveentertainment to your Friends ; what 's in my house is theirs .
Which we 'll make use of ; let 's warm our brains with half a dozenHealths , and then hang cold discourse , for we 'll speak Fire-works. [ Ex .
What , at his Book already ?
Fie , fie , Charles , no hour of interruption ?
Plato differs from Socrates in this .
Come , lay them by ; let them agree at leisure .
Man 's life , Sir , being so short , and then the way that leads untothe knowledge of our selves , so long and tedious , each minute should beprecious .
In our care to manage worldly business , you must part with thisBookish contemplation , and prepare your self for action ; to thrive in thisAge is held the blame of Learning : You must study to know what part of myLand 's good for the Plough , and what for Pasture ; how to buy and sell tothe best advantage ; how to cure my Oxen when they 're o'er-grown withlabour .
I may do this from what I 've read , Sir ; for , what concernsTillage , who better can deliver it than Virgil in his Georgicks ? andto cure your Herds , his Bucolicks is a Masterpiece ; but when he doesdescribe the Commonwealth of Bees , their industry , and knowledge of theherbs from which they gather Honey , with their care to place it with
in the Hive ; their Government among themselves , their order ingoing forth , and coming loaden home ; their obedience to their King , andhis rewards to such as labour , with his punishments only inflicted on theslothful Drone ; I 'm ravish 'd with it , and there reap my Harvest , and therereceive the gain my Cattle bring me , and there find Wax and Honey .
And grow rich in your imagination ; heyday , heyday ! Georgicks,
, and Bees ! art mad ?
No , Sir , the knowledge of these guards me from it .
But can you find among your bundle of Books ( and put in all yourDictionaries that speak all Tongues ) what pleasure they enjoy , that doembrace a well-shap 'd wealthy Bride ? Answer me that .
'T is frequent , Sir , in Story , there I read of all kind of virtuousand vitious women ; the antient Spartan Dames , and Roman Ladies , theirBeauties and Deformities ; and when I light upon a Portia or Cornelia , crown 'd with still flourishing leaves of truth and goodness ; with such afeeling I peruse their Fortunes , as if I then had liv 'd , and freely tastedtheir ravishing sweetness ; at the present loving the whole Sex for theirgoodness and example. But on the contrary , when I look on a
, or a Tullia ; the first bath 'd in her Husband [ s ] bloud ; the latter , without a touch of piety , driving on her Chariot o'er herFather 's breathless Trunk , horrour invades my faculties ; and comparing themultitudes o'th ' guilty , with the few that did die Innocents , I detest andloath 'em as Ignorance or Atheism .
You resolve then ne'er to make payment of the debt you owe me .
What debt , good Sir ?
A debt I paid my Father when I begat thee , and made him aGrandsire , which I expect. from you .
The Children , Sir , which I will leave to all posterity , begot andbrought up by my painful Studies , shall be my living Issue .
Very well ; and I shall have a general Collection of all thequiddits from Adam to this time , to be my Grandchild .
And such a one , I hope , Sir , as shall not shame the Family .
Nor will you take care of my Estate ?
But in my wishes ; for know , Sir , that the wings on which my Soulis mounted , have long since born her too high , to stoop to any Prey thatsoars not upwards. Sordid and dunghill minds , compos 'd of earth , in thatgross Element fix all their happiness ; but purer Spirits , purged andrefin 'd , shake off that clog of humane frailty ; give me leave t'enjoy myself ; that place that does contain my Books ( the best Compa [ n ] ions ) is tome a glorious Court , where hourly I converse with the old Sages andPhilosophers , and sometimes for variety , I confer with Kings and Emperors , and weigh their Counsels , calling their Victories ( if unjustly got ) unto astrict accompt , and in my phancy , deface their ill-plac 'd Statues ; can Ithen part with such constant pleasures , to embrace uncertain vanities ? No , be it your care t'augment your heap of wealth ; it shall be mine t'increasein knowledge -- Lights there for my Study -- [ Exit .
Was ever man that had reason thus transported from all sense andfeeling of his proper good ? It vexes me , and if I found not comfort in myyoung Eustace , I might well conclude my name were at a period !
He is indeed , Sir , the surer base to build on .
Eustace , Egremont , Cowsy , and Andrew .
Eustace .
Sir .
Your ear in private .
I suspect my Master has found harsh welcome , he 's gone supperlessinto his Study ; could I find out the cause , it may be borrowing of hisBooks , or so , I shall be satisfied .
My duty shall , Sir , take any form you please ; and in your motionto have me married , you cut off all dangers the violent heats of youthmight bear me to .
It is well answer 'd .
Nor shall you , my Lord , for your fair Daughter ever find justcause to mourn your choice of me ; the name of Husband , nor the authorityit carries in it , shall ever teach me to forget to be , as I am now , herServant , and your Lordship 's ; and but that modesty forbids , that I shouldsound the Trumpet of my own deserts , I could say , my choice manners havebeen such , as render me lov 'd and remarkable to the Princes of the Blood,
Nay , to the King .
Nay to the King and Council .
These are Court-admirers , and ever echo him that bears the Bag.Though I be dull-ey 'd , I see through this jugling .
Then for my hopes .
Nay certainties .
They stand as fair as any mans. What can there fall in compass ofher wishes , which she shall not be suddenly possess 'd of ? Loves sheTitles ? by the grace and favour of my Princely Friends , I am what shewould have me .
He speaks well , and I believe him .
I could wish I did so. Pray you a word , Sir. He 's a properGentleman , and promises nothing , but what is possible. So far I will gowith you ; nay , I add , he hath won much upon me ; and were he but one thingthat his Brother is , the bargain were soon struck up .
What 's that , my Lord ?
The Heir .
Which he is not , and I trust never shall be .
Come , that shall breed no difference ; you see Charles has giveno'er the world ; I'le undertake , and with much ease , to buy his Birth-rightof him for a Dry-fat of new Books ; nor shall my state alone make way forhim , but my elder Brothers , who being issueless , to advance our name , Idoubt not will add his. Your resolution ?
I'le first acquaint my Daughter with the proceedings ; on theseterms I am yours , as she shall be , make you no scruple. Get the Writingsready , she shall be tractable ; to morrow we will hold a second conference.Farewell noble Eustace ; and you brave Gallants .
Full increase of honour wait ever on your Lordship .
The Gout rather , and a perpetual Meagrim .
You see , Eustace , how I travel to possess you of a Fortune youwere not born to ; be you worthy of it : I'le furnish you for a Suitor : visit her , and prosper i n't .
She 's mine , Sir , fear it not : in all my travels , I ne'er met aVirgin that could resist my Courtship. If it take now , we 're made forever , and will revel it. [ Ex .
In tough Welsh Parsly , which , in our vulgar Tongue , is strongHempen Halters ; my poor Master cozen 'd , and I a looker on ! If we havestudi 'd our Majors and our Minors , Antecedents and Consequents , to beconcluded Coxcombs , w'have made a fair hand on't. I am glad I have foundout all their plots , and their Conspiracies ; this shall t'old Monsieur
, one , that though he can not read a Proclamation , yet dotes onLearning , and loves my Master Charles for being a Scholar ; I hear he'scoming hither , I shall meet him ; and if he be that old , rough , testy bladehe always us 'd to be , I'le ring him such a peal , as shall go near to shaketheir Belroom , peradventure beat 'm , for he is fire and flax ; and so haveat him. [ Exit .
Miramount , Brisac .
Nay , Brother , Brother .
Pray , Sir , be not moved , I meddle with no business but mine own , and in mine own 't is reason I should govern .
But how to govern then , and understand , Sir , and be as wise asy'are hasty , though you be my Brother , and from one bloud sprung , I musttell ye heartily and home too .
What , Sir ?
What I grieve to find , you are a fool , and an old fool , and that'stwo .
We 'll part 'em , if you please .
No , they 're entail 'd to 'em. Seek to deprive an honest nobleSpirit , your eldest Son , Sir , and your very Image , ( but he 's so like you , that he fares the worse for't ) because he loves his Book , and dotes onthat , and only studies how to know things excellent , above the reach ofsuch course Brains as yours , such muddy Fancies , that never will knowfarther than when to cut your Vines , and cozen Merchants , and choak yourhidebound Tenants with musty Harvests .
You go too fast .
I'am not come to my pace yet. Because h'has made his study all hispleasure , and is retir 'd into his Contemplation , not medling with the dirtand chaff of Nature , that makes the spirit of the mind mud too ; thereforemust he be flung from his inheritance ? must he be dispossess 'd , andMonsieur Gingle-boy his younger Brother --
You forget your self .
Because h'has been at Court , and learn 'd new Tongues , and how tospeak a tedious piece of nothing ; to vary his face as Sea-men do theircompass , to worship Images of gold and silver , and fall before the She-calves of the season ; therefore must he jump into his Brother 's Land ?
Have you done yet , and have you spoke enough in praise of Learning , Sir ?
Never enough .
But , Brother , do you know what Learning is ?
It is not to be a Justice of Peace as you are , and palter out yourtime i'th ' penal Statutes. To hear the curious Tenets controverted betweena Protestant Constable , and Jesuite Cobler ; to pick Natural Philosophy outof Bawdry , when your Worship 's pleas 'd to correctifie a Lady ; nor 't is notthe main Moral of blind Justice , ( which is deep Learning ) when yourWorships Tenants bring a light cause , and heavy Hens before ye , both fatand feeble , a Goose or Pig ; and then you 'll sit like equity with bothhands weighing indifferently the state o'th ' question. These are yourQuodlibets , but no Learning , Brother .
You are so parlously in love with Learning , that I 'd be glad toknow what you understand , Brother ; I 'm sure you have read all Aristotle .
Faith no ; but I believe I have a learned faith , Sir , and that 's itmakes a Gentleman of my sort ; though I can speak no Greek , I love thesound of 't , it goes so thund'ring as it conjur 'd Devils : Charles speaksit loftily , and if thou wert a man , or had'st but ever heard of HomersIliads , Hesiod , and the Greek Poets , thou wouldst run mad , and hang thyself for joy th ' hadst such a Gentleman to be thy Son : O he has read suchthings to me !
And you do understand 'em , Brother ?
I tell thee , No , that 's not material ; the sound 's sufficient toconfirm an honest man : Good Brother Brisac , does your young Courtier , that wears the fine Cloaths , and is the excellent Gentleman , ( theTraveller , the Soldier , as you think too ) understand any other power thanhis Tailor ? or knows what motion is more than an Horse-race ? What the Moonmeans , but to light him home from taverns ? or the comfort of the Sun is , but to wear slash 'd clothes in ? And must this piece of ignorance be poptup , because 't can kiss the hand , and cry , sweet Lady ? Say it had been at
, and seen the Reliques , drunk your Verdea Wine , and rid at
, brought home a Box of Venice Treacle with it , to cure youngWenches that have eaten Ashes : Must this thing therefore ? --
Yes Sir , this thing must ; I will not trust my Land to one sosotted , so grown like a Disease unto his Study ; he that will fling off alloccasions and cares , to make him understand what state is , and how togovern it , must , by that reason , be flung himself aside from managing. Myyounger Boy is a fine Gentleman .
He is an Ass , a piece of Ginger-bread , gilt over to please foolishGirls puppets .
You are my elder Brother .
So I had need , and have an elder Wit , thou'dst shame us all else.Go to , I say , Charles shall inherit .
I say , no , unless Charles had a Soul to understand it ; can hemanage six thousand Crowns a year out of the Metaphysics ? or can all hislearn 'd Astronomy look to my Vineyards ? Can the drunken old Poets make upmy Vines ? ( I know they can drink 'em ) or your excellent Humanists sell 'emthe Merchants for my best advantage ? Can History cut my Hay , or get myCorn in ? And can Geometry vend it in the Market ? Shall I have my sheepkept with a Jacobs-staff now ? I wonder you will magnifie this madman , you that are old , and should understand .
Should , say'st thou ? thou monstrous piece of ignorance in Office ! thou that hast no more knowledge than thy Clerk infuses , thy dapper Clerk , larded with ends of Latin , and he no more than custom of offences. Thouunreprieveable Dunce ! that thy formal Bandstrings , thy Ring , nor pomandercannot expiate for , dost thou tell me I should ? I'le pose thy Worship inthine own Library and Almanack , which thou art daily poring on , to pickout days of iniquity to cozen fools in , and Full Moons to cut Cattle : dostthou taint me , that have run over Story , Poetry , Humanity ?
As a cold nipping shadow does o'er ears of Corn , and leave 'emblasted , put up your anger , what I 'll do , I 'll do .
Thou shalt not do .
I will .
Thou art an Ass then , a dull old tedious Ass ; th ' art ten timesworse , and of less credit than Dunce Hollingshead the Englishman , thatwrites of Shows and Sheriffs .
Lewis .
Well , take your pleasure , here 's one I must talk with .
Good-day , Sir .
Fair to you , Sir .
May I speak w'ye ?
With all my heart , I was waiting on your goodness .
Good morrow , Monsieur Miramont .
O sweet Sir , keep your good morrow to cool your Worships pottage ; acouple of the worlds fools met together to raise up dirt and dunghils .
Are they drawn ?
They shall be ready , Sir , within these two hours ; and Charles sethis hand .
'T is necessary ; for he being a joint purchaser , though your Estatewas got by your own industry , unless he seal to the Conveyance , it can beof no validity .
He shall be ready and do it willingly .
He shall be hang 'd first .
I hope your Daughter likes .
She loves him well , Sir ; young Eustace is a bait to catch aWoman , a budding spritely Fellow ; y'are resolv 'd then , that all shall passfrom Charles ?
All , all , he 's nothing ; a bunch of Books shall be his Patrimony , and more than he can manage too .
Will your Brother pass over his Land to your son Eustace ? youknow he has no Heir .
He will be flead first , and Horse-collars made of 's skin .
Let him alone , a wilful man ; my Estate shall serve the turn , Sir.And how does your Daughter ?
Ready for the hour , and like a blushing Rose that stays thepulling .
To morrow then 's the day .
Why then to morrow I 'll bring the Girl ; get you the Writings ready .
But hark you , Monsieur , have you the virtuous conscience to help torob an Heir , an Elder Brother , of that which Nature and the Law flings onhim ? You were your Father 's eldest Son , I take it , and had his Land ; wouldyou had had his wit too , or his discretion , to consider nobly , what 'tisto deal unworthily in these things ; you 'll say he 's none of yours , he'shis Son ; and he will say , he is no Son to inherit above a shelf of Books : Why did he get him ? why was he brought up to write and read , and knowthese things ? why was he not like his Father , a dumb Justice ? a flat dullpiece of phlegm , shap 'd like a man , a reverend Idol in a piece of Arras ? Can you lay disobedience , want of manners , or any capital crime to hischarge ?
I do not , nor do weigh your words , they bite not me , Sir ; this manmust answer .
I have do n't already , and given sufficient reason to secure me : andso good morrow , Brother , to your patience .
Good morrow , Monsieur Miramont .
Good Night-caps keep brains warm , or Maggots will breed in 'em.Well , Charles , thou shalt not want to buy thee Books yet , the fairest inthy Study are my gift , and the University of Lovain , for thy sake , hathtasted of my bounty ; and to vex the old doting Fool thy Father , and thyBrother , they shall not share a Solz of mine between them ; nay more , I 'll give thee eight thousand Crowns a year , in some high strain to writemy Epitaph.ACTUS II. SCENA II .
Eustace , Egremont , Cowsy .
How do I look now , my Elder Brother ? Nay , 't is a handsome Suit .
All Courtly , Courtly .
I 'll assure ye , Gentlemen , my Tailor has travel 'd , and speaks aslofty Language in his Bills too ; the cover of an old Book would not shewthus. Fie , fie ; what things these Academicks are ! these Book-worms , howthey look !
They 're meer Images , no gentle motion or behaviour in 'em ; they'llprattle ye of Primum Mobile , and tell a story of the state of Heaven , what Lords and Ladies govern in such Houses , and what wonders they do whenthey meet together , and how they spit Snow , Fire , and Hail , like a Jugler , and make a noise when they are drunk , which we call Thunder .
They are the sneaking'st things , and the contemptiblest ; suchSmall-beer brains , but ask 'em any thing out of the Element of theirunderstanding , and they stand gaping like a roasted Pig : do they know whata Court is , or a Council , or how the affairs of Christendom are manag 'd ? Do they know any thing but a tired Hackney ? and they cry absurd as theHorse understood 'em. They have made a fair Youth of your Elder Brother , apretty piece of flesh !
I thank 'em for't , long may he study to give me his Estate. Sawyou my Mistris ?
Yes , she 's a sweet young Woman ; but be sure you keep her fromLearning .
Songs she may have , and read a little unbak 'd Poetry , such as theDablers of our time contrive , that has no weight nor wheel to move themind , nor indeed nothing but an empty sound ; she shall have cloaths , butnot made by Geometry ; Horses and Coach , but of no immortal Race : I willnot have a Scholar in my house above a gentle Reader ; they corrupt thefoolish Women with their subtle Problems ; I'le have my house call'dignorance , to fright prating Philosophers from Entertainment .
It will do well , love those that love good fashions , good cloaths , and rich ; they invite men to admire 'em , that speak the lisp of Court. Oh'tis great Learning ! to Ride well , Dance well , Sing well , or WhistleCourtly , they 're rare endowments ; that they have seen far Countreys , andcan speak strange things , though they speak no truths , for then they makethings common. When are you marri 'd ?
To morrow , I think ; we must have a Masque , Boys , and of our ownmaking .
'T is not half an hours work , a Cupid , and a Fiddle , and thething 's done : but let 's be handsome , shall 's be Gods or Nymphs ?
What , Nymphs with Beards ?
That 's true , we 'll be Knights then ; some wandring Knights , thatlight here on a sudden .
Let 's go , let 's go , I must go visit , Gentlemen , and mark whatsweet lips I must kiss to morrow. [ Exeunt.ACTUS II. SCENA III .
Cook , Andrew , Butler,
And how do 's my Master ?
He 's at 's Book ; peace , Coxcomb , that such an unlearned tongue asthine should ask for him !
Do 's he not study conjuring too ?
Have you lost any Plate , Butler ?
No , but I know I shall to morrow at dinner .
Then to morrow you shall be turn 'd out of your place for't ; wemeddle with no spirit o'th ' Buttery , they taste too small for us ; keep mea Pie in Folio , I beseech thee , and thou shalt see how learnedly I'letranslate him. Shall 's have good cheer to morrow ?
Excellent good cheer , Andrew .
The spight o n't is , that much about that time , I shall be arguing , or deciding rather , which are the Males or Females of Red Herrings , andwhether they be taken in the Red-Sea only ; a question found out by
, the learned Motion-maker .
I marry , Butler , here are rare things ; a man that look 'd upon him , would swear he understood no more than we do .
Certain , a learned Andrew .
I 've so much o n't , and am so loaden with strong understanding , Ifear , they 'll run me mad. Here 's a new Instrument , a Mathematical Glisterto purge the Moon with when she is laden with cold phlegmatick humours ; and here 's another to remove the Stars , when they grow too thick in theFirmament .
O Heavens ! why do I labour out my life in a Beef-pot ? and onlysearch the secrets of a Sallad , and know no farther ?
They are not reveal 'd to all heads ; these are far above yourElement of Fire , Cook. I could tell you of Archimedes Glass , to fireyour Coals with ; and of the Philosophers Turf , that ne'er goes out : and,
, I could ravish thee with two rare inventions .
What are they , Andrew .
The one to blanch your Bread from chippings base , and in a moment , as thou wouldst an Almond ; the Sect of the Epicureans invented that : Theother for thy Trenchers , that 's a strong one , to cleanse you twenty dozenin a minute , and no noise heard , which is the wonder , Gilbert ; and thiswas out of Plato 's new Ideas .
Why , what a learned Master do'st thou serve , Andrew ?
These are but the scrapings of his understanding , Gilbert ; withgods and goddesses , and such strange people he deals , and treats with inso plain a fashion , as thou do'st with thy Boy that draws thy drink , or
there , with his Kitchin-Boys and Scalders .
But why should he not be familiar , and talk sometimes , as otherChristians do , of hearty matters , and come into the Kitchin , and there cuthis Breakfast ?
And then retire to the Buttery , and there eat it , and drink a lustyBowl to my young Master , that must be now the Heir , he 'll do all these , Iand be drunk too ; these are mortal things .
My Master studies immortality .
Now thou talk'st of immortality , how do 's thy Wife , Andrew ? my oldMaster did you no small Pleasure when he procur 'd her , and stock 'd you ina Farm. If he should love her now , as he hath a Colts tooth yet , what saysyour learning and your strange Instruments to that , my Andrew ? Can anyof your learned Clerks avoid it ? can ye put by his Mathematical Engine ?
Yes , or I'le break it : thou awaken'st me , and I'le peep i'th ' Moonthis month but I'le watch for him. My Master rings , I must go make him afire , and conjure o'er his Books .
Adieu , good Andrew , and send thee manly patience with thylearning. [ Exeunt.ACTUS II. SCENA IV .
Charles .
I have forgot to eat and sleep with reading , and all my facultiesturn into study ; 't is meat and sleep ; what need I outward garments , when Ican cloath my self with understanding ? The Stars and glorious Planets haveno Tailors , yet ever new they are , and shine like Courtiers. The Seasonsof the year find no fond Parents , yet some are arm 'd in silver Ice thatglisters , and some in gawdy Green come in like Masquers. The Silk-wormspins her own suit and lodging , and has no aid nor partner in her labours.Why should we care for any thing but knowledge , or look upon the World butto contemn it ?
Andrew .
Would you have any thing ?
Andrew , I find there is a flie grown o'er the Eye o'th ' Bull , which will go near to blind the Constellation .
Put a Gold-ring in 's nose , and that will cure him .
Ariadne 's Crown 's away too ; two main Stars that held it fast areslip [ t ] out .
Send it presently to Galateo , the Italian Star-wright , he 'll setit right again with little labour .
Thou art a pretty Scholar .
I hope I shall be ; have I swept Books so often to know nothing ?
I hear thou art married .
It hath pleas 'd your Father to match me to a Maid of his ownchusing ; I doubt her Constellation 's loose too , and wants nailing ; and asweet Farm he has given us a mile off , Sir .
Marry thy self to understanding , Andrew ; these Women are
in all Authors , they 're fair to see to , and bound up in Vellam , smooth , white and clear , but their contents are monstrous ; they treat ofnothing but dull age and diseases. Thou hast not so much wit in thy head , as there is on those shelves , Andrew .
I think I have not , Sir .
No , if thou had'st , thou'ld'st ne'er married a Woman in thy bosom , they 're Cataplasms made o'th ' deadly sins : I ne'er saw any yet but mineown Mother ; or if I did , I did regard them but as shadows that pass by ofunder creatures .
Shall I bring you one ? He trust you with my own Wife ; I would nothave your Brother go beyond ye ; they 're the prettiest Natural Philosophersto play with .
No , no , they 're Opticks to delude mens eyes with. Does my youngerBrother speak any Greek yet , Andrew ?
No , but he speaks High Dutch , and that goes daintily .
Reach me the Books down I read yesterday , and make a little fire , and get a manchet ; make clean those Instruments of Brass I shew 'd you , andset the great Sphere by ; then take the Fox tail , and purge the Books fromdust ; last , take your Lilly , and get your part ready .
Shall I go home , Sir ? my Wife 's name is Lilly , there my best partlies , Sir .
I mean your Grammar , O thou Dunderhead would'st thou be ever inthy Wife 's Syntaxis ? Let me have no noise , nor nothing to disturb me ; Iam to find a secret .
So am I too ; which if I find , I shall make some smart for't -- [ Exeunt .
Lewis , Angellina , Sylvia , Notary .
This is the day , my Daughter Angellina , the happy , that must makeyou a Fortune , a large and full one , my care has wrought it , and yoursmust be as great to entertain it. Young Eustace is a Gentleman at allpoints , and his behaviour affable and courtly , his person excellent ; Iknow you find that , I read it in your eyes , you like his youth ; younghandsome people should be match 'd together , then follows handsomeChildren , handsome fortunes ; the most part of his Father 's Estate , myWench , is ti 'd in a Jointure , that makes up the harmony ; and when ye aremarried , he 's of that soft temper , and so far will be chain 'd to yourobservance , that you may rule and turn him as you please. What , are theWritings drawn on your side , Sir ?
They are , and here I have so fetter 'd him , that if the ElderBrother set his hand to , not all the power of Law shall e'er release him .
These Notaries are notable confident Knaves , and able to do moremischief than an Army. Are all your Clauses sure ?
Sure as proportion ; they may turn Rivers sooner than theseWritings .
Why did you not put all the Lands in , Sir ?
'T was not condition 'd ; if it had been found , it had been but afault made in the Writing ; if not found , all the Land .
These are small Devils , that care not who has mischief , so theymake it ; they live upon the meer scent of dissention. 'T is well , 'tiswell ; are you contented , Girl ? for your will must be known .
A Husband 's welcome , and as an humble Wife I'le entertain him ; noSovereignty I aim at , 't is the man 's , Sir ; for she that seeks it , killsher husbands honour : The Gentleman I have seen , and well observ 'd him , yetfind not that grac 'd excellence you promise ; a pretty Gentleman , and hemay please too , and some few flashes I have heard come from him , but notto admiration as to others : He 's young , and may be good , yet he must makeit , and I may help , and help to thank him also. It is your pleasure Ishould make him mine , and 't has been still my duty to observe you .
Why then let 's go , and I shall love your modesty. To Horse , andbring the Coach out , Angellina ; to morrow you will look more womanly .
So I look honestly , I fear no eyes , Sir. [ Exeunt.ACTUS III. SCENA II .

No Inheritance , Sir ?
You speak like a fool , a coxcomb ; he shall have annual means to buyhim Books , and find him cloathes and meat , what would he more ? Trouble himwith Land ? 't is flat against his nature. I love him too , and honour thosegifts in him .
Shall Master Eustace have all ?
All , all ; he knows how to use it , he 's a man bred in the world , th'other i'th ' Heavens. My Masters , pray be wary , and serviceable ; and
, see all your Sawces be sharp and poynant in the palate , that theymay commend you ; look to your Roast and Bak 'd meats handsomely , and whatnew Kick-shaws and delicate made things -- Is th ' Musick come ?
Yes , Sir , they 're here at Breakfast .
There will be a Masque too ; you must see this Room clean , and,
, your door open to all good-fellows ; but have an eye to yourPlate , for there be Furies ; my Lilly , welcome you are for the Linen , sort it , and see it ready for the Table , and see the Bride-bed made , andlook the cords be not cut asunder by the Gallants too , there be suchknacks abroad. Hark hither , Lilly , to morrow night at twelve a clo [ c ] kI'le sup w'ye : your husband shall be safe , I'le send ye meat too ; before Icannot well slip from my company .
Will you so , will you so , Sir ? I'le make one to eat it , I maychance make you stagger too .
No answer , Lilly ?
One word about the Linen ; I'le be ready , and rest your Worshipsstill .
And I'le rest w'ye , you shall see what rest 'twill be. Are ye sonimble ? a man had need have ten pair of ears to watch you .
Wait on your Master , for I know he wants ye , and keep him in hisStudy , that the noise do not molest him. I will not fail my Lilly -- Comein , sweet-hearts , all to their several duties. [ Exeunt .
Are you kissing ripe , Sir ? Double but my Farm , and kiss her tillthy heart ake.

What a noise is in this house ? my head is broken , within aParenthesis , in every corner , as if the Earth were shaken with somestrange Collect , there are stirs and motions. What Planet rules thishouse ?
Andrew.Who 's there ?
'T is I , Sir , faithful Andrew .
Come near , and lay thine ear down ; hear'st no noise ?
The Cooks are chopping herbs and mince-meat to make Pies , andbreaking Marrow-bones --
Can they set them again ?
Yes , yes , in Broths and Puddings , and they grow stronger for theuse of any man .
What speaking 's that ? sure there 's a Massacre .
Of Pigs and Geese , Sir , and Turkeys , for the spit. The Cooks areangry Sirs , and that makes up the medley .
Do they thus at every Dinner ? I ne 're mark 'd them yet , nor knowwho is a Cook .
They 're sometimes sober , and then they beat as gently as a Tabor .
What loads are these ?
Meat , meat , Sir , for the Kitchen , and stinking Fowls the Tenantshave sent in ; they 'll ne'r be found out at a general eating ; and there'sfat Venison , Sir .
What 's that ?
Why Deer , those that men fatten for their private pleasures , andlet their Tenants starve upon the Commons .
I 've read of Deer , but yet I ne'er eat any .
There 's a Fishmongers Boy with Caviar , Sir , Anchoves , and Potargo , to make ye drink .
Sure these are modern , very modern meats , for I understand 'emnot .
No more does any man from Caca merda , or a substance worse , tillthey be greas 'd with Oyl , and rubb 'd with Onions , and then flung out ofdoors , they are rare Sallads .
And why is all this , prethee tell me , Andrew ? are there anyPrinces to dine here to day ? by this abundance sure there should bePrinces ; I 've read of entertainment for the gods at half this charge ; willnot six Dishes serve 'em ? I never had but one , and that a small one .
Your Brother 's marri 'd this day ; he 's marri 'd your younger Brother
What of that ?
And all the Friends about are bidden hither ; there 's not a Dog thatknows the house , but comes too .
Marri 'd ! to whom ?
Why to a dainty Gentlewoman , young , sweet , and modest .
Are there modest women ? how do they look ?
O you 'll bless yourself to see them. He parts with 's Books , hene'er did so before yet .
What does my Father for 'em ?
Gives all his Land , and makes your Brother heir .
Must I have nothing ?
Yes , you must study still , and he 'll maintain you .
I am his eldest Brother .
True , you were so ; but he has leap 'd o'er your shoulders , Sir .

I like that in him ; would he had flung away his dulness too , andspoke to her .
And must my Brother have all ?
All that your Father has .
And that fair woman too ?
That woman also .
He has enough then. May I not see her sometimes , and call hersister ? I will do him no wrong .

And does he speak well there ?

Brisac , and Charles .
My Father 's here , my Brother too ! that 's a wonder , broke like aSpirit from his Cell .
Come hither , come nearer , Charles ; 't was your desire to see mynoble Daughter , and the company , and give your Brother joy , and then toSeal , Boy ; you do , like a good Brother .
Marry does he , and he shall have my love for ever for't. Put toyour hand now .
Here 's the Deed , Sir , ready .
No , you must pardon me a while , I tell ye , I am in contemplation , do not trouble me .
Come , leave thy Study , Charles .
I 'll leave my life first ; I study now to be a man , I 've found it.Before what Man was , was but my Argument .
I like this best of all , he has taken fire , his dull mist fliesaway .
Will you write , Brother ?
No , Brother , no ; I have no time for poor things , I 'm taking theheight of that bright Constellation .
I say you trifle time , Son .
I will not seal , Sir ; I am your Eldest , and I 'll keep myBirth-right , for Heaven forbid I should become example : Had y'only shew'dme Land , I had deliver 'd it , and been a proud man to have parted with it ; 't is dirt , and labour. Do I speak right , Uncle ?
Bravely , my Boy , and bless thy tongue .
I 'll forward : but you have open 'd to me such a treasure , I find mymind free ; Heaven direct my fortune .
Can he speak now ? Is this a son to sacrifice ?
Such an inimitable piece of Beauty , that I have studied long , andnow found only , that I 'll part sooner with my soul of Reason , and be aPlant , a Beast , a Fish , a Flie , and only make the number of things up , than yield to one foot of Land , if she be ti 'd to't .
He speaks unhappily .
And methinks bravely. This the meer Scholar ?
You but vex your self , Brother , and vex your study too .
Speak such another Ode , and take all yet. What say ye to theScholar now ?
I wonder ; is he your Brother , Sir ?
Yes , would he were buried ; I fear he 'll make an Ass of me ayounger .
Speak not so softly , Sir , 't is very likely .
Come , leave your finical talk , and let 's dispatch , Charles .
Dispatch , what ?
Why the Land .
You are deceiv 'd , Sir. Now I perceive what 't is that wooes awoman , and what maintains her when she 's woo 'd : I 'll stop here. A wilfulpoverty ne'er made a Beauty , nor want of means maintain 'd it vertuously : though land and moneys be no happiness , yet they are counted goodadditions. That use I 'll make ; he that neglects a blessing , though he wanta present knowledge how to use it , neglects himself. May be I have doneyou wrong , Lady , whose love and hope went hand in hand together ; may be myBrother , that has long expected the happy hour , and bless 'd my ignorance ; pray give me leave , Sir , I shall clear all doubts ; why did they shew meyou ? pray tell me that ? ( Mir. He 'll talk thee into a pension for thy knavery . )
You , happy you , why did you break unto me ? The Rosie sugred mornne'er broke so sweetly : I am a man , and have desires within me , affectionstoo , though they were drown 'd a while , and lay dead , till the Spring ofbeauty rais 'd them ; till I saw those eyes , I was but a lump , a chaos ofconfusedness dwelt in me ; then from those eyes shot Love , and hedistinguish 'd , and into form he drew my faculties ; and now I know my Land , and now I love too .
We had best remove the Maid .
It is too late , Sir. I have her figure here. Nay frown not,
, there are less worthy Souls for younger Brothers ; this is noform of Silk , but Sanctity , which wild lascivious hearts can neverdignifie. Remove her where you will , I walk along still , for , like thelight , we make no separation ; you may sooner part the Billows of the Seaand put a barr betwixt their fellowships , than blot out my remembrance ; sooner shut old Time into a Den , and stay his motion , wash off the swifthours from his downy wings , or steal Eternity to stop his glass , than shutthe sweet Idea I have in me. Room for an Elder Brother , pray give place , Sir .
H'as studied duel too ; take heed , he 'll beat thee. H'as frightedthe old Justice into a Feaver ; I hope he 'll disinherit him too for an Ass ; for though he be grave with years , he 's a great Baby .
Do not you think me mad ?
No certain , Sir , I have heard nothing from you but thingsexcellent .
You look upon my cloaths , and laugh at me , my scurvy cloaths !
They have rich linings , Sir. I would your Brother --
His are gold and gawdie .
But touch 'em inwardly , they smell of Copper .
Can ye love me ? I am an Heir , sweet Lady , however I appear a poordependent ; love you with honour I shall love so ever. Is your eyeambitious ? I may be a great man ; is't wealth or lands you covet ? my Fathermust die .
That was well put in , I hope he 'll take it deeply .
Old men are not immortal , as I take it ; is it you look for , youthand handsomness ? I do confess my Brother 's a handsome Gentleman , but heshall give me leave to lead the way , Lady. Can you love for love , and makethat the reward ? The old man shall not love his heaps of Gold with a moredoting superstition , than I'le love you. The young man his delights , theMerchant , when he ploughs the angry Sea up and sees the mountain billowsfalling on him , as if all the Elements , and all their angers , were turn'dinto one vow 'd destruction ; shall not with greater joy embrace his safety.We 'll live together like two wanton Vines , circling our souls and loves inone another , we 'll spring together , and we 'll bear one fruit ; one joyshall make us smile , and one grief mourn ; one age go with us , and one hourof death shall shut our eyes , and one grave make us happy .
And one hand seal the Match , I 'm yours for ever .
Nay , stay , stay , stay .
Nay certainly , 't is done , Sir .
There was a contract .
Only conditional , that if he had the Land , he had my love too ; thisGentleman 's the Heir , and he 'll maintain it. Pray be not angry , Sir , atwhat I say ; or if you be , 't is at your own adventure. You have the out-side of a pretty Gentleman , but by my troth your inside is but barren ; 't is not a face I only am in love with , nor will I say your face isexcellent , a reasonable hunting face to court the wind with ; nor they'renot words , unless they be well plac 'd too , nor your sweet Dam-mes , noryour hired Verses , nor telling me of Clothes , nor Coach and Horses , no noryour visits each day in new Suits , nor your black Patches you wearvariously , some cut like Stars , some in Half-moons , some Lozenges , ( allwhich but shew you still a younger Brother . )
Gramercy , Wench , thou hast a noble Soul too .
Nor your long travels , nor your little knowledge , can make me doatupon you. Faith go study , and glean some goodness , that you may shewmanly ; your Brother at my suit I 'm sure will teach you ; or only study howto get a Wife , Sir. Y'are cast far behind , 't is good you should bemelancholy , it shews like a Gamester that had lost his mony ; and 't is thefashion to wear your arm in a skarf , Sir , for [ you ] have had a shrewd cuto'er the fingers .
But are y'in earnest ?
Yes , believe me , Father , you shall ne'er choose for me ; y'are oldand dim , Sir , and th ' shadow of the earth Eclips 'd your judgment. Y'havehad your time without control , dear Father , and you must give me leave totake mine now , Sir .
This is the last time of asking , will you set your hand to ?
This is the last time of answering , I will never .
Out of my doors .
Most willingly .
He shall , Jew , thou of the Tribe of Man-y-asses , Coxcomb , andnever trouble thee more till thy chops be cold , fool .
Must I be gone too ?
I will never know thee .
Then this man will ; what Fortune he shall run , Father , be't good orbad , I must partake it with him .
Egremont .
When shall the Masque begin ?
'T is done already ; all , all is broken off , I am undone , Friend , myBrother 's wise again , and has spoil 'd all , will not release the Land , haswon the Wench too .
Could he not stay till the Masque was past ? w'are ready. What ascurvy trick 's this ?
O you may vanish , perform it at some Hall , where the Citizens Wivesmay see't for Six-pence a piece , and a cold Supper. Come , let 's go,
And now , my noble Daughter , I'le sell the Tiles of my House , e 're thou shalt want , Wench. Rate up your Dinner , Sir , and sell it cheap : some younger Brother will take't up in Commodities. Send you joy , Nephew
; if you study the Law , keep your great Pippin-pies , they 'll gofar with ye .
I 'd have your blessing .
No , no , meet me no more. Farewel , thou wilt blast mine eyes else .
I will not .
Nor send not you for Gowns .
I 'll wear course Flannel first .
Come , let 's go take some counsel .
'T is too late .
Then stay and dine ; it may be we shall vex 'em. [ Exeunt .
Brisac , Eustace , Egremont , Cowsy .
Ne'er talk to me , you are no men but Masquers ; shapes , shadows , and the signs of men , Court bubbles , that every breath or breaks or blowsaway. You have no souls , no metal in your bloods , no heat to stir ye whenye have occasion : frozen dull things , that must be turn 'd with Leavers.Are you the Courtiers , and the travell 'd Gallants ? the spritely Fellowsthat the people talk of ? Ye have no more spirit than three sleepy sopes .
What would ye have me do , Sir ?
Follow your Brother , and get ye out of doors , and seek yourFortune. Stand still becalm 'd , and let an aged Dotard , a hair-brain'dPuppy , and a Bookish Boy , that never knew a Blade above a Pen-knife , andhow to cut his meat in Characters , cross my design , and take thine ownWench from thee , in mine own house too ? Thou despis 'd poor fellow !
The reverence that I ever bare to you , Sir , then to my Uncle , withwhom 't had been but sawciness t ' have been so rough --
And we not seeing him strive in his own cause , that was principal , and should have led us on , thought it ill manners to begin a quarrel here .
You dare do nothing. Do you make your care the excuse of yourCowardise ? Three Boys on Hobby-horses , with three penny Halberds , wouldbeat you all .
You must not say so .
Yes , and sing it too .
You are a man of peace , therefore we must give way .
I 'll make my way , and therefore quickly leave me , or I 'll forceyou ; and having first torn off your flanting feathers , I 'll trample on'em ; and if that can not teach you to quit my house , I 'll kick ye out of mygates ; you gawdy Glow-worms , carrying seeming fire , yet have no heatwithin ye .
O blest travel ! how much we owe thee for our power to suffer !
Some splenetive Youths now , that had never seen more than thyCountry smoak , will grow in choler ; it would shew fine in us .
Yes marry would it , that are prime Courtiers , and must know noangers , but give thanks for our injuries , if we purpose to hold ourplaces .
Will you find the door ? and find it suddenly ? you shall lead theway , Sir , with your perfum 'd retinue , and recover the now lost
, or build on it , I will adopt some beggar 's doubtful issue , before thou shalt inherit .
We 'll to counsel , and what may be done by man 's wit or valour , we 'll put in Execution .
Do , or never hope I shall know thee. [ Exeunt .
Lewis .
O Sir , have I found you ?
I never hid my self ; whence flows this fury , with which , as itappears , you come to fright me ?
I smell a plot , meer conspiracy amongst ye all to defeat me of myDaughter ; and if she be not suddenly deliver 'd , untainted in herreputation too , the best of France shall know how I am jugled with. Sheis my Heir , and if she may be ravish 'd thus from my care , farewelNobility ; Honour and Blood are meer neglected nothings .
Nay then , my Lord , you go too far , and tax him , whose innocencyunderstands not what fear is. If your unconstant Daughter will not dwellon certainties , must you thenceforth conclude that I am fickle ? what haveI omitted , to make good my integrity and truth ? nor can her lightness , noryour supposition , cast an aspersion on me .
I am wounded in fact , nor can words cure it : do not trifle , butspeedily , once more I do repeat it , restore my Daughter as I brought herhither , or you shall hear from me in such a kind , as you will blush toanswer .
All the world , I think , conspires to vex me , yet I will not tormentmy self : some sprightful mirth must banish the rage and melancholy whichhath almost choak 'd me ; t ' a knowing man 't is Physick , and 't is thoughton ; one merry hour I 'll have in spight of Fortune , to chear my heart , andthis is that appointed ; this night I 'll hug my Lilly in mine arms , provocatives are sent before to chear me , we old men need 'em , and though we pay dear for our stoln pleasures , so it be done securely , the charge much like a sharp sauce , gives 'em relish. Well , honest
, I gave you a Farm , and it shall have a Beacon , to give warningto my other Tenants when the Foe approaches ; and presently , you beingbestowed else-where , I'le graff it with dexterity on your forehead ; indeedI will , Lilly , I come , poor Andrew. [ Exit.ACTUS IV. SCENA II .
Miramont , Andrew .
Do they [ chafe ] roundly ?
As they were rubb 'd with Soap , Sir , and now they swear aloud , nowcalm again ; like a Ring of Bells , whose sound the wind still alters , andthen they sit in counsel what to do , and then they jar again what shall bedone ; they talk of Warrants from the Parliament , Complaints to the King , and Forces from the Province ; they have a thousand heads in a thousandminutes , yet ne'er a one head worth a head of Garlick .
Long may they chafe , and long may we laugh at 'em ; a couple of purePuppies yok 'd together. But what sayes the young Courtier Master
, and his two warlike Friends ?
They say but little , how much they think I know not ; they lookruefully , as if they had newly come from a vaulting-house , and had beenquite shot through 'tween wind and water by a she Dunkirk , and hadsprung a Leak , Sir. Certain my Master was to blame .
Why , Andrew ?
To take away the Wench o'th ' sudden from him , and give him nolawful warning ; he is tender , and of a young Girls constitution , Sir , ready to get the Green sickness with conceit. Had he but ta'ne his leavein availing Language , or bought an Elegy of his condolement , that theworld might have ta'ne notice , he had been an Ass , 't had been somefavour .
Thou say'st true , wise Andrew ; but these Scholars are suchthings , when they can prattle .
And very parlous things , Sir .
And when [ they ] gain the liberty to distinguish the difference'twixt a Father and a Fool , to look below , and spie a younger Brotherpruning up , and dressing up his expectations in a rare glass of beauty , too good for him ; those dreaming Scholars then turn Tyrants , Andrew , andshew no mercy .
The more 's the pity , Sir .
Thou told'st me of a trick to catch my Brother , and anger him alittle farther , Andrew. It shall be only anger , I assure thee , andlittle shame .
And I can fit you , Sir. Hark in your ear .
Thy Wife ?
So I assure ye ; this night at twelve a clock .
'T is neat and handsome ; there are twenty Crowns due to thy project,
; I 've time to visit Charles , and see what Lecture he reads tohis Mistris. That done , I'le not fail to be with you .
Nor I to watch my master -- [ Exeunt.ACTUS IV. SCENA III .
Angelli [ n ] a , Sylvia , with a Taper .
I 'm worse than e'er I was ; for now I fear , that that I love , thatthat I only dote on ; he follows me through every room I pass , and with astrong set eye he gazes on me , as if his spark of innocence were blowninto a flame of lust. Virtue defend me. His Uncle too is absent , and 'tisnight ; and what these opportunities may teach him -- What fear and endlesscare 't is to be honest ! to be a Maid what misery , what mischief ! Would Iwere rid of it , so it were fairly .
You need not fear that , will you be a child still ? He follows you , but still to look upon you ; or if he did desire to lie with ye , 't is butyour own desire , you love for that end ; I'le lay my life , if he were now abed w'ye , he is so modest , he would fall asleep straight .
Dare you venture that ?
Let him consent , and have at ye ; I fear him not , he knows not whata woman is , nor how to find the mystery men aim at. Are you afraid of yourown shadow , Madam ?
He follows still , yet with a sober face ; would I might know theworst , and then I were satisfied .
Ye may both , and let him but go with ye .
Why do you flie me ? what have I so ill about me , or within me , todeserve it ?
I am going to bed , Sir .
And I am come to light ye ; I am a Maid , and 't is a Maidens office .
You may have me to bed , Sir , without a scruple , and yet I am charytoo who comes about me. Two Innocents should not fear one another .
The Gentleman says true. Pluck up your heart , Madam .
The glorious Sun both rising and declining we boldly look upon ; even then , sweet Lady , when , like a modest Bride , he draws nightscurtains , even then he blushes , that men should behold him .
I fear he will perswade me to mistake him .
'T is easily done , if you will give your mind to't .
Pray ye to your bed .
Why not to yours , dear Mistris ? one heart and one bed .
True , Sir , when 't is lawful : but yet you know --
I would not know , forget it ; those are but sickly loves that hangon Ceremonies , nurs 'd up with doubts and fears ; ours high and healthful , full of belief , and fit to teach the Priest : Love shall seal first , thenhands confirm the bargain .
I shall be a Heretick if this continue. What would you do a bed ? you make me blush , Sir .
I 'd see you sleep , for sure your sleeps are excellent , you thatare waking such a noted wonder , must in your slumber prove an admiration.I would behold your dreams too , if't were possible ; those were richshowes .
I am becoming Traitor .
Then like blew Neptune courting of an Island , where all theperfumes and the precious things that wait upon great Nature are laid up , I 'd clip it in my arms , and chastly kiss it , dwell in your bosome likeyour dearest thoughts , and sigh and weep .
I 've too much woman in me .
And those true tears falling on your pure Crystals , should turn toarmelets for great Queens t'adore .
I must be gone .
Do not , I will not hurt ye ; this is to let you know , my worthiestLady , y'have clear 'd my mind , and I can speak of love too : Fear not mymanners , though I never knew , before these few hours , what a Beauty was , and such a one that fires all hearts that feel it ; yet I have read ofvirtuous Temperance , and study 'd it among my other Secrets ; and soonerwould I force a separation betwixt this spirit and the case of flesh , thanbut conceive one rudeness against Chastity .
Then we may walk .
To bed , and pray then , we may have a fair end of our fair loves ; would I were worthy of you , or of such parents that might give you thanks : But I am poor in all but in your love. Once more , good night .
A good night t'ye , and may the dew of sleep fall gently on you , sweet one , and lock up those fair lights in pleasing slumbers ; no dreamsbut chaste and clear attempt your fancy , and break betimes sweet morn , I 've lost my light else .
Let it be ever night when I lose you .
This Scholar never went to a Free-School , he 's so simple .
Servant .
Your Brother , with two Gallants , is at door , Sir , and they 're soviolent , they 'll take no denial .
This is no fit time of night .
Let 'em in , Mistris .
They stay no leave ; shall I raise the house on 'em ?
Not a man , nor make no murmur oft I charge ye .
Eustace , Egremont , Cowsy .
They 're here , my Uncle absent , stand close to me. How do you , Brother , with your curious story ? have you not read her yet sufficiently ?
No , Brother , no ; I stay yet in the Preface : the style 's too hardfor you .
I must entreat her ; she 's parcel of my goods .
She 's all when you have her .
Hold off your hands , unmannerly , rude Sir ; nor I , nor what I havedepend on you .
Do , let her alone , she gives good counsel ; do not trouble yourself with Ladies , they are too light : Let out your Land , and get aprovident Steward .
I can not love ye , let that satisfie you ; such vanities as you , areto be laugh 'd at .
Nay , then you must go ; I must claim mine own .
Away , away with her .
She strikes offand take your Coxcomb up : Let me talk [ Eustace 's hat.civilly a while with you , Brother. It may be on some terms I may part withher .
O , is your heart come down ? what are your terms , Sir ? Put up , putup .
But do not kill 'em , Sir .
You speak too late , Dear ; it is my first fight , and I must dobravely , I must not look with partial eyes on any ; I can not spare a buttonof these Gentlemen ; did life lie in their heel , Achilles like , I 'd shootmy anger at those parts , and kill 'em. Who waits within ?
Sir .
View all these , view 'em well , go round about 'em , and still viewtheir faces ; round about yet , see how death waits upon 'em , for thou shaltnever view 'em more .
Pray hold , Sir .
I can not hold , you stand so fair before me ; I must not hold ; 'twill darken all my glories. Go to my Uncle , bid him post to the King , and get my pardon instantly , I have need o n't .
Are you so unnatural ?
You shall die last , Sir , I 'll take thee dead , thou art no man tofight with. Come , will ye come ? Me-thinks I 've fought whole Battels .
We have no quarrel to you that we know on , Sir .
We 'll quit the house , and ask ye mercy too. Good Lady , let nomurther be done here ; we came but to parly .
How my sword thirsts after them ! Stand away , Sweet .
Pray , Sir , take my submission , and I disclaim for ever .
Away , ye poor things , ye despicable creatures ! do you come posteto fetch a Lady from me ? from a poor School-boy that ye scorn 'd of late , and grow lame in your hearts when you should execute ? Pray take her , takeher , I am weary of her : What did you bring to carry her ?
A Coach and four Horses .
But are they good ?
As good as France can shew Sir .
Are you willing to leave those , and take your safeties ? Speakquickly .
Yes with all our hearts .
'T is done then. Many have got one Horse , I 've got four by th'bargain .

How now , who 's here ?
Nay , now y'are gone without bail .
What , drawn , my Friends ? Fetch me my two-hand Sword ; I will notleave a head on your shoulders , Wretches .
In troth , Sir , I came but to do my duty .
And we to renew our loves .
Bring me a Blanket. What came they for ?
To borrow me a while , Sir ; but one that never fought yet , has socurri 'd , so bastinado 'd them with manly carriage , they stand like things
had turn 'd to stone : they watch 'd your being absent , and thenthought they might do wonders here , and they have done so ; for by my trothI wonder at their coldness , the nipping North or Frost never came nearthem ; St George upon a sign would grow more sensible. If the name ofHonour were for ever to be lost , these were the most sufficient men to doit in all the world ; and yet they are but young , what will they rise to ? They 're as full of fire as ' a frozen Glow-worms rattle , and shine as
they have right use o n't ; they 'll stand still for an hour and be beaten.These are the Anagrams of three great Worthies .
They will infect my house with cowardize , if they breath longer init ; my roof covers no baffl 'd Monsieurs , walk and air your selves ; as Ilive they stay not here.

Who are they in the corner ? As I live , a covy ofFidlers ; I shall have some Musick yet at my making free o'th ' Company of

Thou shalt rule me , Andrew. O th'infinite fright that will assailthis Gentleman ! the Quartans , Tertians , and Quotidians that will hang likeSerjeants on his Worships shoulders ? the humiliation of the flesh of thisman , this grave , austere man will be wondred at. How will those solemnlooks appear to me ; and that severe face , that speaks chains and shackles ? Now I take him in the nick , e 're I have done with him , he had better havestood between two panes of Wainscot , and made his recantation in theMarket , than hear me conjure him .

Well done , well done , give me my night-cap. So. Quick , quick , untruss me ; I will truss and trounce thee. Come , Wench , a kiss betweeneach point ; kiss close , it is a sweet Parenthesis .

Ha'ye done yet ?
No ; but I will do , and do wonders , Lilly. Shew me the way .

Have I not thy promise , Lilly ?
Yes , and I have performed enough to a man of your years , this istruth ; and you shall find , Sir , you have kiss 'd and tous 'd me , handl 'd myleg and foot ; what would you more , Sir ? As for the rest , it requires youthand strength , and the labour in an old man would breed Agues , Sciatica 's , and Cramps : You shall not curse me for taking from you what you cannotspare , Sir. Be good unto your self , y'have ta'ne already all you can takewith ease ; you are past threshing , it is a work too boisterous for you , leave such drudgery to Andrew .
How she jeers him !
Let Andrew alone with his own tillage , he 's tough , and can manureit .
Y'are a quean , a scoffing , jeering quean .
It may be so , but I 'm sure I 'll ne'r be yours .
Do not provoke me , if thou do'st I 'll have my Farm again , and turnthee out a begging .
Though you have the will , and want of honesty to deny your deed , Sir ; yet I hope Andrew has got so much learning from my young Master , asto keep his own ; at the worst I 'll tell a short tale to the Judges , forwhat grave ends you sign 'd your Lease , and on what terms you would revokeit .

Art thou serious ? speak , honest Andrew , since thou hast o'erheardus , and wink at small faults , man ; I 'm but a pidlar , a little will servemy turn ; thou'lt find enough when I 've my belly full : Wilt thou be privateand silent ?
By all means , I 'll only have a Ballad made of't , sung to some lewdTune , and the name of it shall be Justice Trap ; it will sell rarely withyour Worships name , and Lilly 's on the top .

You trouble me. Then his intent arriving , the vizard of hishypocrisie pull 'd of [ f ] to the Judge criminal .
O I am undone .
He 's put out of Commission with disgrace , and held uncapable ofbearing Office ever hereafter. This is my revenge , and this I 'll put inpractice .
Do but hear me .
To bring me back from my Grammar to my Hornbook , it isunpardonable .
Do not play the Tyrant ; accept of composition .
Hear him , Andrew .
What composition ?
I 'll confirm thy Farm , and add unto it a hundred Acres more , adjoyning to it .
Umb , this mollifies ; but y'are so fickle , and will again deny this , there being no witness by .
Call any witness , I 'll presently assure it .
Say you so ? troth there 's a friend of mine , Sir , within hearing , that 's familiar with all that 's past , his testimony will be authentical .
Will he be secret ?
You may tie his tongue up , as you would do your purse-strings .
Miramont !
Ha-ha-ha !
This is my witness. Lord how you are troubled ! sure you have anAg [ u ] e , you shake so with choler : Here 's your loving Brother , Sir , andwill tell no body but all he meets , that you have eat a Snake , and aregrown young , gamesome , and rampant .
Caught thus ?
If he were one that would make jests of you , or plague ye , withmaking your Religious gravity ridiculous to your Neighbours , then you hadsome cause to be perplex 'd .
I shall become discourse for Clowns and Tapsters .
Quick , Lilly , quick , he 's now past kissing , between point andpoint. He swounds , fetch him some Cordial -- Now put in , Sir .
Who may this be ? sure this is some mistake : let me see his face , wears he not a false beard ? it can not be Brisac that worthy Gentleman , the Pillar and the Patron of his Country ; he is too prudent , and toocautelous , experience hath taught him t'avoid these fooleries , he is thepunisher , and not the doer ; besides he 's old and cold , unfit for Woman : This is some counterfeit , he shall be whipt for't , some base abuser of myworthy Brother .
Open the doors ; will ye imprison me ? are ye my Judges ?
The man raves ! this is not judicious Brisac : yet now I thinko n't , h'has a kind of Dog look like my Brother , a guilty hanging face .
I 'll suffer bravely , do your worst , do , do .
Why , it 's manly in you .
Nor will I rail nor curse , you slave , you whore , I will not meddlewith you ; but all the torments that e 're fell on men , that fed onmischief , fall heavily on you all. [ Exit .
You have given him a heat , Sir .
He will ride you the better , Lilly .
We 'll teach him to meddle with Scholars .
He shall make good his promise t'increase thy Farm , Andrew , orI 'll jeer him to death. Fear nothing , Lilly , I am thy Champion. Thisjeast goes to Charles , and then I 'll hunt him out , and Monsieur
the gallant Courtier , and laugh heartily to see 'em mourntogether .
'Twill be rare , Sir. [ Exeunt .
Eustace , Egremont , Cowsy .
Turn 'd out of doors and baffled !
We share with you in the affront .
Yet bear it not like you with such dejection .
My Coach and Horses made the ransom of our Cowardize !
Pish , that 's nothing , 't is damnum reparabile , and soon recover 'd .
It is but feeding a Suitor with false hopes , and after squeeze himwith a dozen of Oaths , You are new rigg 'd , and this no more remembred .
And does the Court , that should be the Example and Oracle of theKingdom , read to us no other Doctrine ?
None that thrives so well as that , within my knowledge .
Flattery rubs out ; but since great men learn to admire themselves , 't is something crest-faln .
To be of no Religion , argues a subtle , moral understanding , and itis often cherish 'd .
Piety then , and valour , nor to do and suffer wrong , are they novirtues ?
Rather vices , Eustace ; Fighting ! what 's fighting ? it may be infashion among provant swords , and Buff-jerkin men : But w'us that swim inchoice of Silks and Tissues ; though in defence of that word Reputation , which is indeed a kind of glorious nothing , to lose a dram of blood mustneeds appear as coarse as to be honest .
And all this you seriously believe ?
It is a faith that we will die in , since from the black Guard tothe grim Sir in Office , there are few hold other Tenets .
Now my eyes are open , and I behold a strong necessity that keepsme knave and coward .
Y'are the wiser .
Nor can I change my copy , if I purpose to be of your society .
By no means .
Honour is nothing with you ?
A meer bubble ; for what 's grown common , is no more regarded .
My sword forc 'd from me too , and still detain 'd , you think 't is noblemish .
Get me a Batton , 't is twenty times more Court-like , and lesstrouble .
And yet you wear a sword .
Milan hilt , and a Damasco blade forornament , not use , the Court allows it .
Will't not fight of it self ?
I ne'er tri 'd this , yet I have worn as fair as any man ; I 'm sureI 've made my Cutler rich , and paid for several weapons , Turkish and
, two thousand Crowns , and yet could never light upon a fightingone .
I'le borrow this , I like it well .
'T is at your service , Sir , a Lath in a Velvet Scabbard will servemy turn .
And now I have it , leave me ; y'are infectious , the plague andleprosie of your baseness spreading on all that do come near you ; such asyou render the Throne of Majesty , the Court , suspected and contemptible ; you are Scarabee 's that batten in her dung , and have no palats to tasteher curious Viands ; and like Owles , can only see her night deformities , but with the glorious splendor of her beauties , you are struck blind asMoles , that undermine the sumptuous Building that allow 'd you shelter : youstick like running ulcers on her face , and taint the pureness of hernative candor , and being bad Servants , cause your Masters goodness to bedisputed of ; you make the Court , that is the abstract of all Academies , toteach and practise noble undertakings , ( where courage sits triumphantcrown 'd with Lawrel , and wisdom loaded with the weight of honour ) a Schoolof Vices .
What sudden rapture 's this ?
A heavenly one , that raising me from sloth and ignorance , ( inwhich your conversation long hath charm 'd me ) carries me up into the airof action , and knowledge of my self ; even now I feel , but pleading only inthe Court 's defence ( though far short of her merits and bright lustre ) ahappy alteration , and full strength to stand her Champion against all theworld , that throw aspersions on her .
Sure he 'll beat us , I see it in his eyes .
A second Charles ; pray look not , Sir , so furiously .
Recant what you have said , ye Mungrils , and lick up the vomit yehave cast upon the Court , where you unworthily have had warmth andbreeding , and swear that you , like Spiders , have made poison of that whichwas a saving Antidote .
We will swear any thing .
We honour the Court as a most sacred place .
And will make oath , if you enjoyn us to't , nor knave , nor fool , nor coward living in it .
Except you two , you Rascals .
Yes , we are all these , and more , if you will have it so .
And that until you are again reform 'd and grown new men , youne'ere presume to name the Court , or press into the Porter 's Lodge but fora penance , to be disciplin 'd for your roguery , and this done with truecontrition .
Yes , Sir .
You again may eat scraps , and be thankful .
Here 's a cold breakfast after a sharp nights walking .
Keep your oaths , and without grumbling vanish .
We are gone , Sir. [ Exeunt .
May all the poorness of my spirit go with you : the fetters of mythraldom are fil 'd off , and I at liberty to right my self ; and though myhope in Angellina 's little , my honour ( unto which compar 'd she'snothing ) shall , like the Sun , disperse those lowring Clouds that yetobscure and dim it ; not the name of Brother shall divert me , but from him , that in the world 's opinion ruin 'd me , I will seek reparation , and callhim unto a strict accompt. Ha ! 't is near day , and if the Muses friend , Rose-cheek 'd Aurora , invite him to this solitary Grove , as I much hopeshe will , he seldome missing to pay his vows here to her , I shall hazardto hinder his devotions -- The door opens , 't is he most certain , and by'sside my Sword. Blest Opportunity .
Charles .
I have o'er-slept my self , and lost part of the morn , but I'lerecover it : Before I went to bed , I wrote some Notes within my Table-book , which I will now consider. Ha ! what means this ? What do I with a Sword ? Learn 'd Mercury needs not th ' aid of Mars , and innocence is to it selfa guard ; yet since Arms ever protect Arts , I may justly wear and use it ; for since 't was made my prize , I know not how I 'm grown in love with't , and can not eat nor study , and much less walk without it. But I trifle , matters of more weight ask my judgment .
Now , Sir , treat of no other Theme , I'le keep you to it , and seey'expound it well .
Eustace !
The same , Sir , your younger Brother , who , as duty binds him , hathall this night ( turn 'd out of door ) attended , to bid Good-morrow t'ye .
This not in scorn , commands me to return it. Would you ought else ?
O much , Sir , here I end not , but begin ; I must speak to you inanother strain than yet I ever us 'd ; and if the language appear in thedelivery rough and harsh , you ( being my Tutor ) must condemn your self , from whom I learn 'd it .
When I understand ( be't in what style you please ) what 's yourdemand , I shall endeavour , in the self-same phrase , to make an answer tothe point .
I come not to lay claim to your birth-right , 't is your own , and'tis fit you enjoy it ; nor ask I from you your learning and deepknowledge ; ( though I am not a Scholar as you are ) I know them Diamonds byyour sole industry , patience and labour , forc 'd from steep Rocks , and withmuch toil attended , and but to few that prize their value granted , andtherefore without Rival freely wear them .
These not repin 'd at ( as you seem t'inform me ) the motion must beof a strange condition , if I refuse to yield to't ; therefore , Eustace , without this tempest in your looks , propound it , and fear not a denial .
I require then ( as from an Enemy , and not a Brother ) thereputation of a man , the honour , not by a fair War won when I was waking , but in my sleep of folly ravish 'd from me ; with these , the restitution ofmy Sword , with large acknowledgment of satisfaction , my Coach , my Horses ; I will part with life , ere lose one hair of them ; and , what concludes all , my Mistris Angellina , as she was before the musical Magick of thy tongueinchanted and seduc 'd her. These perform 'd , and with submission , and donepublickly , at my Father 's and my Uncle 's intercession , ( that I put in too ) I perhaps may listen to terms of reconcilement ; but if these , in everycircumstance , are not subscrib 'd to , to the last gasp I defie thee .
These are strict conditions to a Brother .
My rest is up , nor will I give less .
I 'm no Gamester , Eustace , yet I can ghess your resolution standsto win or lose all ; I rejoyce to find ye thus tender of your honour , andthat at length you understand what a wretched thing you were , how deeplywounded by your self , and made almost incurable in your own hopes , thedead flesh of pale cowardise growing over your festred reputation , whichno Balm or gentle Unguent could ever make way to ; and I am happy that Iwas the Surgeon that did apply those burning corrosives , that render youalready sensible o'th ' danger you were plung 'd in , in teaching you , and bya fair gradation , how far , and with what curious respect and care thepeace and credit of a man within , ( which you ne'er thought till now ) should be preferr 'd before a gawdy outside ; pray you fix here , for so farI go with you .
This discourse is from the subject .
I'le come to it , Brother ; but if you think to build upon myruines , you 'll find a false foundation : your high offers , taught by theMasters of dependencies , that by compounding differences 'tween others , supply their own necessities , with me will never carry't : as you are myBrother , I will dispense a little , but no more than honour can give wayto ; nor must I destroy that in my self I love in you ; and therefore letnot hopes or threats persuade you I will descend to any composition forwhich I may be censur 'd .
You shall fight then .
With much unwillingness with you ; but if there 's no evasion --
None .
Hear yet a word ; as for the Sword and other fripperies , in a fairway send for them , you shall have 'em. But rather than surrender
, or hear it again mention 'd , I oppose my breast unto loudthunder , cast behind me all tyes of Nature .
She detain 'd , I 'm deaf to all persuasion .
Guard thy self then. Eustace ; I use no other Rhetorick .
Miram .
Clashing of swords so near my house ! Brother oppos 'd to Brother ! here 's no fencing at half sword ; hold , hold , Charles , Eustace .
Second him , or call in more help. Come not between us , I'le notknow nor spare you ; D 'ye fight by th ' book ?
'T is you that wrong me , off Sir , and suddenly , I'le conjure downthe Spirit that I have rais 'd in him .
Never , Charles , 't is thine , and in thy death , be doubled in me .
I 'm out of breath , yet trust not too much to't , Boys ; for if youpause not suddenly , and hear reason , do , kill your Uncle , do ; but that I'mpatient , and not a cholerick old teasty fool , like your Father , I 'd dancea matachin with you , should make you sweat your best bloud for't ; I would , and it may be I will. Charles , I command thee , and Eustace , I entreatthee , th'art a brave Spark , a true tough-metall 'd blade , and I begin tolove thee heartily ; give me a fighting Courtier , I'le cherish him forexample ; in our Age they 're not born every day .
You of late , Sir , in me lov 'd learning .
True , but take me w'ye , Charles ; 't was when young Eustace worehis heart in 's breeches , and fought his Battels in Complements andCringes , when 's understanding wav 'd in a flanting Feather , and his bestcontemplation look 'd no further than a new fashion 'd doublet ; I confessthen , the lofty noise your Greek made , only pleas 'd me ; but now he'sturn 'd an Oliver and a Rowland , nay , the whole dozen of Peers arebound up in him : Let me remember , when I was of his years , I did look verylike him ; and did you see my Picture as I was then , you would swear thatgallant Eustace ( I mean , now he dares fight ) was the true substance , andthe perfect figure. Nay , nay , no anger , you shall have enough , Charles .
Sure , Sir , I shall not need addition from him .
Nor I from any , this shall decide my interest ; though I am lost toall deserving men , to all that men call good , for suffering tamelyinsufferable wrongs , and justly slighted by yielding to a minute of delayin my revenge , and from that made a stranger unto my Father 's house andfavour , o'erwhelm 'd with all disgraces ; yet I will mount upward , and forcemy self a fortune , though my birth and breeding do deny it .
Seek not , Eustace , by violence , what will be offer 'd to you oneasier composition ; though I was not alli 'd unto your weakness , you shallfind me a Brother to your bravery of spirit , and one that , not compell'dto't by your sword , ( which I must never fear ) will share with you in allbut Angellina .
Nobly said , Charles , and learn from my experience , you may hearreason , and never maim your fighting ; for your credit , which you think youhave lost , spare Charles , and swinge me , and soundly ; three or fourwalking velvet Cloaks , that wear no swords to guard 'em , yet deserve it , thou art made up again .
All this is Lip-salve .
It shall be Hearts-ease , Eustace , ere I have done ; as for thyFather 's anger , now thou dar'st fight , ne'er fear it , for I 've the dowcetsof his gravity fast in a string , I will so pinch and wring him , that , spight of his authority , thou shalt make thine own conditions with him .
I'le take leave a little to consider .
Here comes Andrew .
But without his comical and learned face ; what sad disaster,
?
You m [ a ] y read , Sir , a Tragedy in my face .
Art thou in earnest ?
Yes , by my life , Sir ; and if now you help not , and speedily , byforce , or by persuasion , my good old Master ( for now I pity him ) is ruin'dfor ever .
Ha , my Father !
He , Sir .
By what means ? speak .
At the suit of Monsieur Lewis ; his house is seiz 'd upon , and hein person is under guard , ( I saw it with these eyes , Sir ) to be convey'dto Paris , and there Sentenc 'd .
Nay , then there is no jesting .
Do I live , and know my Father injur 'd ?
And what 's worse , Sir , my Ladie Angellina --
What of her ?
She 's carri 'd away too .
How ?
While you were absent , a crew of Monsieur Lewis friends andkinsmen , by force , brake in at th ' back part of the house , and took heraway by violence ; faithful Andrew ( as this can witness for him ) did hisbest in her defence , but 'twould not do .
Away , and see our Horses sadled , 't is no time to talk , but do .
, you now are offer 'd a spatious field , and in a pious War toexercise your valour ; here 's a cause , and such a one , in which to fall ishonourable , your dutie and reverence due to a fathers name commanding it ; but these unnatural jars arising between Brothers ( should you prosper ) would shame your victory .
I would do much , Sir , but still my rep [ u ] tation !
shall give you all decent satisfaction ; nay , joyn hands , and heartily , why , this is done like Brothers ; and as old as I am , in thiscause that concerns the honour of our Family , Monsieur Lewis ( if reasoncannot work ) shall find and feel there 's hot blood in this arm , I'le leadyou bravely .
And if I follow not , a cowards name be branded on my forehead .
This spirit makes you a sharer in my fortunes .
And in mine , of which ( Brisac once freed , and Angellina againin our possession ) you shall know , my heart speaks in my tongue .
I dare not doubt it , Sir. [ Exeunt.ACTUS V. SCENA II .
Lewis , Brisac , Angelli [ n ] a , Sylvia , Officers .
I 'm deaf to all perswasions .
I use none , nor doubt I , though a while my innocence suffers , butwhen the King shall understand how false your malice hath inform 'd him , hein justice must set me right again .
Sir , let not passion so far transport you , as to think in reason , this violent course repairs , but ruins it ; that honour you would build up , you destroy ; what you would seem to nourish , if respect of my prefermentor my pattern may challenge your paternal love and care , why do you , nowgood fortune has provided a better Husband for me than your hopes couldever fancy , strive to rob me of him ? In what is my Lord Charlesdefective , Sir ? unless deep Learning be a blemish in him , or wellproportion 'd limbs be mulcts in nature , or , what you only aim 'd at , largeRevenues , are , on the sudden , grown distasteful to you. Of what can youaccuse him ?
Of a Rape done to Honour , which thy ravenous lust made thee consentto .
Her lust ! you are her Father .
And you her Bawd .
Were you ten Lords , 't is false ; the pureness of her chaste thoughtsentertains not such spotted instruments .
As I have a Soul , Sir .
I am not to be alter 'd ; to sit down with this disgrace , would argueme a Peasant , and not born Noble : all rigour that the Law , and thatincrease of power by favour yields , shall be with all severity inflicted ; you have the King 's hand for't , no Bail will serve , and therefore at yourperils , Officers , away with 'em .
This is madness .
Tell me so in open Court , and there I'le answer you .
Miramont , Charles , Eustace , Andrew .
Well overtaken .
Ill if they dare resist .
He that advances but one step forward dies .
Shew the King 's Writ .
Shew your discretion , 'twill become you better .
Y'are once more in my power , and if again I part with you , let mefor ever lose thee .
Force will not do't , nor threats ; accept this service from yourdespair 'd of Eustace .
And beware your Reverend Worship never more attempt to search my
, you see what follows .
Is the King 's power contemn 'd ?
No , but the torrent o ' your wilful folly stopp'd. And for you , goodSir , if you would but be sensible , what can you wish , but the satisfactionof an obstinate will , that is not endear 'd to you ? rather than be cross'din what you purpos 'd , you 'll undo your Daughter 's fame , the credit of yourjudgment , and your old foolish Neighbour ; make your Estates , and in a Suitnot worth a Cardecue , a prey to Advocates , and their buckram Scribes , andafter they have plum 'd ye , return home like a couple of naked Fowleswithout a feather .
This is a most strong truth , Sir .

Here 's a learned Lecture ! Lew. From this idlenesseDiseases both in body and in mindeGrow strong upon you ; where a stirring natureWith wholesome exercise guards both from danger : I'de have thee rise with the Sunne , walke , dance or hunt , Visite the groves and springs , and learne the vertueOf Plants and Simples : Doe this moderately , And thou shall not with eating chalke , or coales , Leather and oatmeale , and such other trash , Fall into the greene sicknesse. Syl. With your pardon ( Were you but pleas 'd to minister it ) I couldPrescribe a remedy for my Ladies health , And her delight too , farre transcending thoseYour Lordship but now mention'd. Lew. What is it Sylvia ?
What i'st ? A noble Husband ; In that word , aNoble Husband , all content of WomanIs wholly comprehended ; He will rowse her , As you say , with the Sunne , and so pipe to her , As she will dance , ne 're doubt it , and hunt with her , Upon occasion , untill both be weary ; And then the knowledge of your Plants and Simples , As I take it , were superfluous ; A loving , And but adde to it a gamesome Bedfellow , Being the sure Physician. Lew. Well said Wench .
A full estate , and that said , I 've said all , And get me such a one with these additions , Farewell Virginity , and welcome wedlock .
But where is such one to be met with Daughter ? A black Swan is more common , you may weareGrey tresses ere we find him. Ang. I am notSo punctual in all ceremonies , I will bateTwo or three of these good parts , before Ile dwellToo long upon the choice. Syl. Onely , my Lord , rememberThat he be rich and active , for without theseThe others yeeld no relish , but these perfect ; You must bear with small faults , Madam. Lew. Merry Wench , And it becomes you well ; Ile to Brisac , And try what may be done ; ith ' mean time , home , And feast thy thoughts with th ' pleasures of a Bride .
Thoughts are but airy food Sir , let her tast them .
Andrew , Cooke , Butler.Unload part of the Library , and make roomeFor th ' other dozen of Carts , Ile straight be with you .
Why hath he more bookes ? And. More than ten Marts send over .
And can he tell their names ? And. their names ? he has 'emAs perfect as his pater noster , but that 's nothing , 'Has red them over leaf by leaf three thousand times ; But here 's the wonder , though their weight would sinkA Spanish Carrack , without other ballast , He carryeth them all in his head , and yetHe walkes upright. But. Surely he has a strong braine .
If all thy pipes of wine were fill 'd with bookesMade of the barkes of trees , or mysteries writIn old moth-eaten vellam , he would sip thy CellerQuite dry , and still be thirsty ; Then for 's Diet , He eats and digests more Volumes at a meal , Than there would be Larkes ( though the sky should fall ) Devowred in a moneth in Paris , yet feare notSons oth ' buttry , and kitchin , though his learn 'd stomackCannot b ' appeas 'd ; Hee 'll seldom trouble you , His knowing stomack contemnes your blacke Jacks , Butler , And your Flagons ; and Cook thy boyl 'd , thy roast , thy bak 'd .
How liveth he ? And. Not as other men doe , Few Princes fare like him ; He breakes his fastWith Aristotle , dines with Tully , takesHis watering with the Muses , sups with Livie , Then walkes a turne or two in via lactea , And ( after six houres conference with the starres ) Sleepes with old Erra Pater. But. This is admirable .
I'le tell you more hereafter , here 's my old MasterAnd another old ignorant Elder , Ile upon 'em .
Brisac , Lewis.What Andrew ? welcome , where 's my Charles ! speake Andrew , Where didst thou leave thy Master ? And. ContemplatingThe number of the sands in the high way , And from that , purposes to make a judgementOf the remainder in the Sea ; He is Sir , In serious study , and will lose no minute , Nor out of 's pace to knowledge. Lew. This is strange .
Yet he hath sent his duty Sir before himIn this fair manuscript. Bri. What have we here ? Pot-hookes and Andirons ! And. I much pitie you , It is the Syrian Character , or the Arabicke , Would 'ee have it said , so great and deep a ScholarAs Master Charles is , should ask blessingIn any Christian Language ? Were it Greeke , I could interpret for you , but indeedI 'm gone no farther. Bri. And in Greeke , you canLie with your smug wife Lilly. And. If I keepe herFrom your French dialect , as I hope I shall Sir , Howere she is your Laundresse , she shall put youTo th ' charge of no more soape than usuallFor th ' washing of your sheets. Bri. Take in the knave , And let him eat. And. And drink too Sir. Bri. And drinke too Sir , And see your Masters Chamber ready for him .

Your blessing , Sir ? Bri. Rise Charles , thou hast it .
Sir , though it be unusual in the Court , ( Since 't is the Courtiers garbe ) I bend my knee , And do expect what followes. Bri. Courtly begg'd.My blessing ! take it. Eust. Your Lordships vow 'd adorer : to Lew.What a thing this brother is ! yet Ile vouchsafe himThe new Italian shrug -- How clownishlyThe book-worme does return it ! Ch. I 'm glad y'are well ; reads .

And will report your bounty in the Court .

, Bucolicks , and Bees ! Art mad ?
No Sir , the knowledge of these guards me from it .
But can you find among your bundle of bookes ( And put in all your Dictionaries that speak all tongu 's ) What pleasure they enjoy , that do embraceA well shap 'd wealthy Bride ? Answer me that .
Tis frequent Sir in story , there I read ofAll kinde of vertuous and vitious women ; The ancient Spartan Dames , and Roman Ladyes , Their beauties and deformities , and whenI light upon a Portia or Cornelia , Crown 'd with still-flourishing leaves of truth and goodness , With such a feeling I peruse their fortunes , As if I then had liv 'd , and freely tastedTheir ravishing sweetness ; at the present lovingThe whole sexe for their goodness and example.But on the contrary when I looke onA Clytemnestra , or a Tullia ; The first bath 'd in her husbands blood ; The latter , Without a touch of piety , driving onHer Chariot ore her fathers breathless trunk , Horrour invades my faculties ; and comparingThe multitudes o ' th ' guilty , with the fewThat did dye Innocents , I detest , and loathe 'mAs ignorance or Atheisme. Bri. You resolve thenNere to make payment of the debt you owe me .
Was ever man that had reason thus transportedFrom all sense and feeling of his proper good ? It vexes me , and if I found not comfortIn my young Eustace , I might well concludeMy name were at a period ! Lew. Hee 's indeed SirThe surer base to build on. Bri. Eustace. Eust. Sir. [ Ent. Eust. Egre. Cow. & Andr .
Your eare in private. And. I suspect my masterHas found harsh welcome , he 's gon supperlessInto his study ; could I find out the cause , It may be borrowing of his books , or so , I shall be satisfi'd. Eust. My duty shall Sir , Take any forme you please ; and in your motionTo have me married , you cut off all dangersThe violent heats of youth might beare me to .
It is well answer'd. Eust. Nor shall you my LordFor your faire Daughter ever finde just causeTo mourn your choice of me ; the name of husband , Nor the authority it carries in itShall ever teach me to forget to beAs I am now her servant , and your Lordships ; And but that modesty forbids , that IShould sound the Trump of my owne deserts , I could say my choice manners have been such , As render me lov 'd and remarkableTo th ' Princes of the blood. Cow. Nay to the King .
Nay to the King and Councel. And. These are Court admirers , And ever eccho him that beares the bagg.Though I be dull-ey 'd , I see through this jugling .
Then for my hopes : Cow. Nay certainties. Eust. They standAs faire as any mans. What can there fallIn compass of her wishes which she shall notBe suddenly possess 'd of ? Loves she titles ? By th ' grace and favour of my princely friends , I am what she would have me. Bri. He speakes well , And I beleeve him. Lew. I could wish I did so.Pray you a word Sir. He 's a proper Gentleman , And promises nothing , but what is possible.So far I will go with you ; Nay I add , He hath won much upon me , and were heBut one thing that his brother is , the bargainWere soone struck up. Bri. What 's that my Lord ? Lew. the heire .
Which he is not , and I trust never shall be .
Come , that shall breed no difference ; you see
has giv'n ore the World ; Ile undertake , And with much ease , to buy his birthright of himFor a dry-fat of new bookes ; nor shall my stateAlone make way for him , but my-elder brothers , Who being issueless , t'advance our name , I doubt not will add his ; Your resolution ?
He first acquaint my daughter with the proceedings , On these terms I am yours , as she shall be , Make you no scruple , get the writings ready , She shall be tractable ; to-morrow we will holdA second conference : Farewell noble Eustace , And you brave Gallants. Eust. Ful increase of honourWait ever on you [ r ] Lordship. And. The Gowt ratherAnd a perpetual Meagrim. Bri. You see Eustace , How I travail to possess you of a fortuneYou were not born to ; be you worthy of it , Ile furnish you for a Suitor ; visit herAnd prosper in't. Eust. Shee 's mine Sir , fear it not : In all my travailes , I nere met a VirginThat could resist my Courtship. Eust. If take now , Ware made for ever , and will revel it. Exeunt .
In tough Welsh parsly , which in our vulgar TongueIs strong hempen halters ; My poore Master coo'znd , And I a looker on ! If we have studiedOur majors , and our minors , antecedents , And consequents , to be concluded coxcombes , W have made a faire hand o n't ; I am glad I h 've foundOut all their plots , and their conspiracies ; This shall t ' old Mounsieur Miramont , one , that thoughHe can not read a Proclamation , yetDotes on learning , and loves my Master CharlesFor being a Schollar ; I hear hee 's comming hither , I shall meet him , and if he be that oldRough teasty blade he always us 'd to be , I'le ring him such a peale as shall go neereTo shake their belroome , peradventure , beat 'm , For he is fire and flaxe , and so have at him. Exit .
Miramont , Brisac.Nay Brother , brother. Bri. Pray Sir be not moved , I meddle in no business but mine own , And in mine owne 't is reason I should governe .
But how to govern then , and understand Sir , And be as wise as y'are hasty , though you beMy brother , and from one bloud sprung , I must tell yeeHeartily and home too. Br. What Sir ? Mir. What I grieve to findYou are a foole , and an old foole , and that 's two .
We'l part 'em , if you please. Mir. No they 're entailed to 'em.Seeke to deprive an honest noble spirit , Your eldest Son Sir ? and your very Image , ( But he 's so like you that he fares the worse for't ) Because he loves his booke and doates on that , And onely studies how to know things excellent , Above the reach of such course braines as yours , Such muddy fancies , that never will know fartherThen when to cut your Vines , and cozen Merchants , And choake your hide-bound Tenants with musty harvests .
You go to fast. Mir. I 'm not come too my pace yet ; Because h ' has made his studie all his pleasure , And is retyr 'd into his Contemplation , Not medling with the dirt and chaffe of nature , That makes the spirit of the mind mud too , Therefore must he be flung from his inheritance ? Must he be dispossess 'd , and Mounsieur Gingle boyHis younger brother -- Bri. You forget your self .
Because h ' has been at Court and learn 'd new tongues , And how to speak a tedious peece of nothing ; To vary his face as Seamen do their Compass , To worship images of gold and silver , And fall before the she Calves of the Season , Therefore must he jump into his brothers land ?
Have you done yet , and have you spake enough , In praise of learning , Sir ? Mir. Never enough .
But brother do you know what learning is ?
It is not to be a justice of Peace as you are , And palter out your time ith ' penal Statutes.To heare the curious Tenets controvertedBetween a Protestant Constable , and Jesuit Cobler , To pick natural Philosophic out of bawdry , When your Worship 's pleas 'd to correctifie a Lady ; Nor 't is not the main moral of blinde Justice , ( Which is deep learning ) when your worships TenantsBring a light cause , and heavie Hennes before yee , Both fat and feesible , a Goose or Pig , And then you sit like equity with both handsWeighing indifferently the state oth ' question.These are your quodlibets , but no learning Brother .
You are so parlously in love with learning , That I'de be glad to know what you understand , brother.I'me sure you have read all Aristotle. Mir. Faith no , But I beleeve , I have a learned faith Sir , And that 's it makes a Gentleman of my sort ; Though I can speak no Greek I love the sound o n't , It goes so thundering as it conjur 'd Devils .
speakes it loftily , and if thou wert a man , Or had'st but ever heard of Homers Iliads,
, and the Greek Poets , thou wouldst run mad , And hang thy self for joy th ' hadst such a GentlemanTo be thy son ; O he has read such thingsTo me ! Bri. And you do understand 'm Brother ?
He is an asse , a peece of Ginger-bread , Gilt over to please foolish girles puppets .
Thou shall not doe. Bri. I will. Mir. Thou art an Asse then , A dull old tedious Asse , th [ ' ] art ten times worseAnd of lesse credit than Dunce HollingsheadThe Englishman , that writes of snowes and Sheriffes .
Lewis .
Wel take you pleasure , here 's one I must talke with .
Good day Sir. Bri. Faire to you Sir. Lew. May I speake w'ye ?
With all my heart , I was waiting on your goodness .
Good morrow Mo [ n ] sieur Miramont. Mir. O sweet Sir , Keep your good morrow to coole your Worships pottage , A couple of the worlds fooles met togetherTo raise up dirt and dunghils. Lew. Are they drawne ?
They shall be ready Sir , within these two houres ; And Charles set his hand. Lew. 'T is necessary ; For he being a joint purchaser , though your stateWas got by your owne industrie , unlesseHe seale to the Conveyance , it can beOf no validity. Bri. He shall be ready , And do it willingly. Mir. He shall be hang 'd first .
I hope your daughter likes. Lew. S [ h ] e loves him well Sir.Young Eustace is a bait to catch a woman , A budding spritely fellow ; y'are resolved then , That all shall passe from Charles. Bri. All all , hee 's nothing , A bunch of bookes shall be his patrimony , And more then he can manage too. Lew. Will your brotherPasse over his land to , to your son Eustace ? You know he has no heire. Mir. He will be flead first , And horse-collars made of 's skin ! Bri. let him alone , A wilful man ; my state shall serve the turne , Sir.And how does your Daughter ? Lew. Ready for the houre , And like a blushing Rose that staies the pulling .
To morrow , then 's the day. Lew. Why then to morrowIle bring the Girle ; get you the Writings ready .
But hark you Monsieur , have you the vertuous conscienceTo help to robb an heire , an Elder Brother , Of that which Nature and the Law flings on him ? You were your fathers eldest son , I take it , And had his Land , would you had had his wit too , Or his discretion to consider nobly , What 't is to deale unworthily in these things ; You'l say hee 's none of yours , he 's his son ; And he will say , he is no son to inheritAbove a shelfe of Bookes ; Why did he get him ? Why was he brought up to write and reade , and know things ? Why was he not like his father , a dumbe Justice ? A flat dull peece of flegme , shap 'd like a man , A reverend Idoll in a peece of arras ? Can you lay disobedience , want of manners , Or any capital crime to his charge ? Lew. I doe not , Nor do not weigh your words , they bite not me , Sir ; This man must answer. Bri. I have do n't already.And giv'n sufficient reason to secure me ; And so good morrow brother to your patience .
Good morrow Monsieur Miramont. Mir. Good night-capsKeepe braines warme , or Maggots will breed in 'm.Well Charles , thou shall not want to buy thee bookes yet , The fairest in thy study are my gift , And the University Lovaine for thy sake , Hath tasted of my bounty , and to vexTh ' old doting foole thy father , and thy brother , They shall not share a Solz of mine between them ; Nay more , Ile give thee eight thousand Crowns a year , In some high strain to write my Epitaph .
Eustace , Egremont , Cowsy.How do I look now my elder Brother ? Nay , t'is a handsome Suit. Cow. All courtly , courtly .
Ile assure ye Gentlemen , my Taylor has travail 'd , And speaks as lofty Language in his bills too ; The cover of an old Book would not shew thus.Fye , fie ; what things these Academicks are ? These book-worms , how they look ! Egr. Th'are mere Images , No gentle motion nor behaviour in 'm , They'l prattle ye of primum mobile , And tell a story of the state of Heaven , What Lords and Ladies govern in such houses , And what wonders they do when they meet together , And how they spit snow , fire , and hail like a Jugler , And make a noise when they are drunk , which we call Thunder .
It will do well , love those that love good fashions , Good clothes and rich , they invite men to admire 'm , That speak the lisp of Court. Oh 't is great Learning ! To ride well , dance well , sing well , or whistle Courtly , Th ' are rare endowments ; that they have seen far Countries , And can speak strange things , though they speak no truths , For then they make things common. When are you married ?
To morrow , I think , we must have a Masque Boyes , And of our own making. Egre. 'T is not half an houres work , A Cupid and a fiddle , and the thing 's done , But let 's be handsome , shall 's be Gods or Nymphs ?
What , Nymphs with beards ? Cow. That 's true , we'l be Knightsthen , Some wandring Knights , that light here on a sudden .
Let 's go , let 's go , I must go visit , Gentlemen , And mark what sweet lips I must kiss to morrow. Exeunt .
Cook , Andrew , Butler.And how do 's my Master ? And. Is at 's book , peace Coxcomb , That such an unlearn 'd tongue as thine should ask for him !
Do 's he not study conjuring too ? And. Have youLost any Plate , Butler ? But. No , but I knowI shall to morrow at dinner. And. Then to morrowYou shall be turn 'd out of your place for't ; we meddleWith no spirits oth ' Buttry , they taste too small for us ; Keep me a Pye in folio , I beseech thee , And thou shall see how learnedly Ile translate him ; Shalls have good cheer to morrow ? Coo. Ex. Lent , good cheer Andrew .
The spight o n't is , that much about that time , I shall be arguing , or deciding rather , Which are the Males or Females of red HerringsAnd whether they be taken in the red Sea onely , A question found out by Copernicus , The learned Motion-maker. Co. I marry Butler , Here are rare things ; a man that look 'd upon him , Would swear he understood no more than we do .
Certain , a learned Andrew. And. I 've so much on'tAnd am so loaden with strong understanding , I fear , they'l run me mad , here 's a new instrument , A metamatical glister to purge the Moon with , When she is laden with cold flegmatick humours , And here 's another to remove the Stars , When they grow too thick in the Firmament .
O heavens ! why do I labour out my lifeIn a beef-pot ? and only search the secretsOf a Sallad ; and know no farther ! And. They are notReveal 'd to all heads ; These are far aboveYour Element of Fire. Cooke. I could tell youOf Archimides glass to fire your coals with , And of the Philosophers turf that nere goes out ; And Gilbert Butler , I could ravish thee , With two rare inventions. But. What are they Andrew ?
The one to blanch your bread from chippings base , And in a moment , as thou wouldst an Almond , The Sect of the Epicureans invented that ; The other for thy trenches , that 's a strong one , To cleanse you twenty dozen in a minute , And no noise heard , which is the wonder Gilbert , And this was out of Plato 's new Idea 's .
Why , what a learned Master do'st thou serve Andrew ?
These are but the scrapings of his understanding , Gilbert ; With gods and goddesses , and such strange peopleHe deals , and treats with in so plain a fashion , As thou do'st with thy boy that drawes thy drink , Or Ralph there with his kitchin boyes and scalders .
But why should he not be familiar and talk sometimes , As other Christians do , of hearty matters , And come into the Kitchin , and there cut his breakfast ?
And then retyre to the Buttry and there eat it , And drink a lusty bowle to my younger MasterThat must be now the heir will do all these , I and be drunk too ; These are mortal things .
My Master studies immortality. Coo. Now thou talk'stOf immortality , how do 's thy wife Andrew ? My old MasterDid you no small pleasure when he procur 'd herAnd stock 'd you in a farme. If he should love her now , As he hath a Colts tooth yet , what sayes your learningAnd your strange instruments to that my Andrew ? Can any of your learned Clerks avoid it ? Can ye put by his Mathematical Engine ?
Yes , or Ile break it ; thou awaken'st me , And Ile peep ith ' Moon this moneth but Ile watch for him.My Master rings , I must go make him a fire , And conjure ore his books. Coo. Adieu good Andrew , And send thee manly patience with thy learning. Exeu .
Charles.I have forgot to eat and sleep with reading , And all my faculties turn into studie ; 'T is meat and sleep ; what need I outward garments , When I can cloathe my self with understanding ? The stars and glorious planets have no Taylors , Yet ever new they are and shine like Courtiers.The seasons of the yeare find no fond parents , Yet some are arm 'd in silver Ice that glisters , And sovne in gawdy green come in like Masquers : The Silk-worme spines her owne suit and her lodging , And has no aid nor partner in her labours : Why should we care for any thing but knowledge , Or look upon the world but to contemne it ?
Andrew.Would you have any thing ? Cha. Andrew , I findThere is a flie grown o 're the eye oth ' Bull , Which will go neere to blind the Constellation .
Put a gold-ring in 's nose , and that will cure him .
Ariadne 's crown 's away too ; two main starresThat held it fast are slip 'd out. And. Send it presentlyTo Gallatteo the Italian Star-wrightHee 'll set it right againe with little labour .
Thou art a pretty Schollar. And. I hope I shall be ; Have I swept bookes so often to know nothing ?
I heare thou art married. And. It hath pleas 'd your fatherTo match me to a maid of his owne choosing , I doubt her constellation 's loose too , and wants nailing , And a sweet farme he has given us a mile off Sir .
Marry thy selfe to understanding , Andrew , These women are Errata in all Authours , They 're faire to see to , and bound up in vellam , Smooth , white and cleare , but their contents are monstrous ; They treat of nothing but dull age and diseases.Thou hast not so much wit in thy head , as there isOn those shelves , Andrew. And. I think I have not Sir .
No , if thou had'st thould'st nere marryed a womanIn thy bosome , they 're Cataplasmes made oth ' deadly sins : I nere saw any yet but mine own mother ; Or if I did , I did regard them butAs shadowes that passe by of under Creatures .
Shall I bring you one ? lie trust you with my owne wife ; I would not have your brother go beyond ye ; Th'are the prittiest natural Philosophers to play with .
No , no , th'are Opticks to delude mens eyes with.Does my younger brother speake any Greek yet , Andrew ?
No , but he speaks High Dutch , and that goes as daintily .
Reach me the bookes down I read yesterday , And make a little fire and get a manchet ; Make cleane those instruments of brass I shew 'd you , And 'set the great Sphere by , then take the fox tayleAnd purg the bookes from dust , last take your Lilly , And get your part ready. And. Shall I go home Sir ? My wives name is Lilly , there my best part lyes , Sir .
I mean your Gammer , O thou dunderhead ! Would'st thou be ever in thy wives Syntaxis ? Let me have no noise nor nothing to disturb me , I am to find a secret. And. So am I too , Which if I you find , I shall make some smart for't. -- Exeunt .
3. Scena 1.Lewis , Angellina ; Sylvia , Notary.This is the day my daughter Angellina , The happy , that must make you a fortune , A large and full one , my great care has wrought it , And yours must be as great to entertaine it ; Young Eustace is a Gentleman at all points , And his behaviour affable and courtly , His person excellent , I know you find that , I read it in your eyes , you like his youth , Young handsome people should be match 'd together , Then followes handsome Ch [ i ] ldren , handsome fortunes ; The most part of his fathers state , my Wench , Is ti 'd in a joynture , that makes up the harmony ; And when y'are marryed. he 's of that soft temper , And so far will be chain 'd to your observance , That you may rule and turne him as you please.What are the writings drawn on our side , Sir ?
They are , and here I have so fetter 'd him , That if the Elder Brother set his hand to , Not all the power of law shall ere release him .
These Notaries are notable confident Knaves , And able to doe more mischeife than an Army : Are all your clauses sure ? Not. Sure as proportion , They may turne Rivers sooner than these writings .
Why did you not put all the lands in , Sir ?
Twas not condition'd. Not. If it had been found , It had been but a fault made in the writing ; If not found all the Land. Lew. These are small DevilsThat care not who has misch [ ie ] fe , so they make it ; They live upon the meere scent of dissension.Tis well , tis well , Are you contented Girle ? For your wil must be known. Ang. A husband 's welcom , And as an humble wife He entertaine him , No soveraignty I aime at , 't is the mans Sir , For she that seekes it , killes her husbands Honour : The Gentleman I have scene , and well observ 'd him , Yet find not that grac 'd excellence you promise , A pretty Gentle man and he may please too , And some few flashes I have hear 'd come from him , But not to admiration as to others ; Hee 's young and may be good , yet he must make it , And I may help , and help to thank him also.It is your pleasure I should make him mine , And't has beene still my duty to observe you .
Why then let 's go , And I shall love your modesty.To horse , and bring the Coach out Angellina , To morrow you will looke more womanly .
So I looke honestly , I feare no eyes , Sir. Exeunt .
Brisac , Andrew , Cooke , Lilly.Wait on your Master , he shall have that befits him ;
No inheritance , Sir ? Bri. You speak like a foole , a coxcomb , He shall have annual meanes to buy him bookes , And find him cloathes and meat , what would he more ? Trouble him with Land ? tis flat against his nature : I love him too , and honour those gifts in him .
Shall Master Eustace have all ? Bri. All , all , he knowes howTo use it , hee 's a man bred in the world , T'other ith ' heavens : my Masters , pray be wary , And serviceable ; and Cooke see all your sawcesBe sharp and poynant in the pallat , that they mayCommend you ; looke to your roast and bak 'd meates hansomly , And what new kickshawes and delicate made things -- Is th ' musick come ? But. Yes Sir , th'are here at breakfast .
There will be a Masque too , you must see this roome clean , And Butler your doore open to all good fellowes , But have an eye to your plate , for their be Furies ; My Lilly welcome , you are for the linnen , Sort it , and see it ready for the table , And see the bride-bed made , and looke the cords beNot cut asunder by the Gallants too , There be such knacks abroad ; hark hither , Lilly , To morrow night at twelve a clock , Ile suppe w'ye , Your husband shall be safe , Ile send ye meat too , Before I can not well slip from my company .
Will ye so , will you so , Sir ? Ile make one to eate it , I may chance make you stagger too. Bri. No answer , Lilly ?
One word about the linnen ; Ile be ready , And rest your worships still. And. And Ile rest w'yee , You shall see what rest 'twill be : Are ye so nimble ? A man had need have ten paire of eares to watch you .
Wait on your Master , for I know he wants ye , And keep him in his studie , that the noiseDo not molest him : I will not faile my Lilly -- Come in sweet hearts , all to their several duties. Exeunt .
are you kissing ripe , Sir ? Double but my farmAnd kisse her till thy heart ake ; these smocke vermin , How eagerly they leap at old mens kisses , They lick their lipps at profit , not at pleasure ; And if't were not for th ' scurvie name of Cuckold , He should lye with her , I know shee'l labour at lengthWith a good lordship. If he had a wife now , But that 's all one , lie fit him : I must upUnto my Master , hee'l be mad with studie -- Exit .
Scoena III.Charles.What a noise is in this house , my head is broken , Within a Parenthesis , in every corner , As if the earth were shaken with some strange Collect , There are stirres and motions. What Planet rules this house ?
Andrew.Who 's there ? And. Tis I Sir faithful Andrew. Cha. Come neereAnd lay thine eare downe , hear'st no noise ? And. The CookesAre chopping hearbs and mince meat to make pies , And breaking Marrow-bones -- Char. Can they set them againe ?
Yes , yes , in brothes and puddings , and they grow strongerFor the ' use of any man. Cha. What speaking 's that ? Sure there is a massacre. And. Of Pigs and Geese Sir , And Turkeys for the spit. The Cookes are angry Sirs , And that makes up the medly. Cha. Do they thusAt every dinner ? I nere mark 'd them yet , Nor know who is a Cook. And. Th'are sometimes sober , And then they beat as gently as a Tabor .
What loads are these ? Andr. Meat , meat , Sir , for the Kitchin , And stinking Fowles the Tenants have sent in ; They'l nere be found out at a general eating ; And there 's fat Venison , Sir. Cha. What 's that ? And. Why Deer , Those that men fatten for their private pleasures , And let their tenants starve upon the Commons .
I 've red of Deer , but yet I nere eat any .
There 's a Fishmongers boy with Caviar Sir , Anchoves and Potargo , to make ye drink .
Sure these are modern , very modern meats , For I understand 'm not. And. No more do 's any manFrom Caca merda or a substance worse , Till they be greas 'd with oyle , and rub 'd with onions , And then flung out of doors , they are rare Sallads .
And why is all this , prithee tell me Andrew ! Are there any Princes to dine here to day ? By this abundance sure there should be Princes ; I 've read of entertainment for the godsAt half this charge , will not six dishes serve 'em ? I never had but one , and that a small one .
Your Brother 's married this day , he 's married , Your younger brother Eustace. Cha. What of that ?
And all the friends about are bidden hither.There 's not a dog that knowes the house but comes too .
Married ? to whom ? And. Why to a dainty Gentlewoman , Young , sweet , and modest. Cha. Are there modest women ? How do they look ? And. O you'ld blesse your self to see them.He parts with 's book , he nere did so before yet .
What do 's my father for 'm ? And. Gives all his Land , And makes your brother Heir. Cha. Must I have nothing ?
Yes , you must study still , and he'l maintain you .
I am his eldest brother. And. True , you were so , But he has leapd ore your shoulders , Sir. Cha. 'T is wel , He'l not inherit my understanding too ?
I think not , he'l scarce find tenants to let itOut to. Cha. Hark , hark. Andr. The Coach that brings the fairLady .
Lewis , Angellina , Ladies , Notary , & c .
Now you may see her. Cha. Sure this should be modest ; But I do not truly know what women make of it,
; She has a face looks like a story , The storie of the Heavens looks very like her .
She has a wide face then. Cha. She has a Cheiubins , Cover 'd and vail 'd with modest blushes .

Brisac , Eustace , Egremont , Cowsy , Miramont .
Welcome sweet Daughter , welcome noble Brother , And you are welcome Sir , with all your writings , Ladies most welcome ; What ? my angry brother ! You must be welcome too , the Feast is flat else .
I am not come for your welcome , I expect none ; I bring no joyes to blesse the bed withal ; Nor songs , nor Masques to glorifie the Nuptials , I bring an angrie mind to see your folly , A sharp one too , to reprehend you for it .
You'l stay and dine though ? Mir. All your meat smells mustie , Your table will shew nothing to content me .
Ile answer you , here 's good meat. Mira. But your sawce isscurvie ; It is not season 'd with the sharpness of discretion .
It seems your anger is at me , dear Uncle .
Thou art not worth my anger , th'art a boy , A lump o ' thy fathers lightness , made of nothingBut antick cloaths and cringes ; look in thy head , And 'twill appear a footbal full of fumesAnd rotten smoke ; Ladie , I pitie you ; You are a handsome and a sweet young Ladie , And ought to have a handsome man yoak 'd t'ye , An understanding too ; this is a Gincrack , That ca [ n ] get nothing but new fashions on you ; For say he have a thing shap 'd like a child , 'Twill either prove a tumbler or a tailor .
These are but harsh words Uncle. Mir. So I mean 'em.Sir , you play harsher play w ' your elder brother .
I would be loth to give you. Mi. Do not venter , Ile make your wedding cloaths fit closer t'ee then ; I but disturb you , lie go see my nephew:
Pray take a piece of rosemarie. Mir. Ile wear it , But for the Ladies sake , and none of yours ; May be Ile see your table too. Bri. Pray do , Sir .
A mad old Gentleman. Bri. Yes faith sweet daughter , He has been thus his whole age to my knowledge , He has made Charles his heir , I know that certainly ; Then why should he grudge Eustace any thing ?
I would not have a light head , nor one ladenWith too much learning , as they say , this Charles is , That makes his book his Mistress : Sure , there 's somethingHid in this old mans anger , that declares himNot a mere Sot. Bri. Come shall we go and seal brother ? All things are readie , and the [ P ] riest is here.When Charles has set his hand unto the Writings , As he shall instantly , then to the Wedding , And so to dinner. Lew. Come , let 's seal the book firstFor my daughters Jointure. Bri. Let 's be private i n't Sir. Exeunt .
Charles , Miramont , Andrew .
Nay , y'are undone. Cha. hum. Mira. Ha ' ye no greater feeling ?
You were sensible of the great b [ oo ] ke , Sir , When it fell on your head , and now the houseIs ready to fall , Do you feare nothing ? Cha. WillHe have my bookes too ? Mir. No , he has a book , A faire one too to read on , and read wonders , I would thou hadst her in thy studie Nephew , And 'twere but to new string her. Cha. Yes , I saw her , And me though [ t ] 't was a curious peece of learning , Handsomely bound , and of a daintly letter .
He flung away his booke. Mir. I like that in him , Would he had flung away his dulness too , And speak to her. Cha. And must my brother have all ?
All that your father has. Cha. And that faire woman too ?
That woman also. Cha. He has enough thenMay I not see her somtimes , and call her Sister ? I will doe him no wrong. Mir. This makes me madI could now cry for anger ; these old foolesAre the most stubborn and the wilfullest Coxcombs -- Farewil , and fall to your booke , forget your brother ; You are my heire , and Ile provide y'a wife ; Ile looke upon this marriage , though I hate it. Exit .
Brisac.Where is my son ? And. There Sir , casting a figureWhat chopping children his brother shall have .
He do 's well ; How do'st Charles ? still at thy book ?
Hee 's studying now Sir , who shall be his father .
Peace you rude Knave -- Come hither Charles be merry .
I thank you , I am busie at my book , Sir .
You must put your hand my Charles , as I would have youUnto a little peece of parchment here ; Onely your name , you write a reasonable hand .
But I may do unreasonably to write it.What is it Sir ? Bri. To passe the Land I have , Sir , Unto your younger brother. Cha. Is't no more ?
No , no , 't is nothing ; you shall be provided for , And new bookes you shall have still , and new studies , And have your meanes brought in without thy care boy , And one still to attend you. Cha. This shewes your love father .
I 'm tender to you. And. Like a stone , I take it .
Why father , Ile go downe , a n't please you let me , Because Ide see the thing they call the Gentlewoman , I see no woman but through contemplation , And there Ile doe't before the company , And wish my brother fortune. Bri. Doe I prithee .
I must not stay , for I have things aboveRequire my study. Bri. No , thou shalt not stay , Thou shalt have a brave dinner too. And. Now has heOrethrowne himselfe for ever ; I will downInto the Celler , and be stark drunk for anger. Exeunt .

Come let him bring his sons hand , and all 's done.Is yours ready ? Pr. Yes Ile dispatch ye presently , Immediately for in truth I am a hungry .
Doe speak apace , for we believe exactlyDoe not we stay long Mistris ? Ang. I find no fault , Better things well done than want time to doe them.Uncle , why are you sad ? Mir. Sweet smelling blossome , Would I were thine Uncle to thine owne content , Ide make thy husbands state a thousand , betterA yearlie thousand , thou hast mist a man , ( But that he is addicted to his studie , And knowes no other Mistresse than his minde ) Would weigh down bundles of these emptie kexes .
Can he speak , Sir ? Mir. Faith yes , but not to women : His language is to heaven , and heavenlie wonder , To Nature , and her dark and secret causes .
And does he speak well there ? Mir. O , admirably ; But hee 's to bashful too behold a woman , There 's none that sees him , nor he troubles none .
He is a man. Mir. Faith Yes , and a cleare sweet spirit .
Then conversation me thinkes -- Mir. So think IBut it is his rugged fate , and so I leave you .
I like thy noblenesse. Eust. See my mad UncleIs courting my faire Mistresse. Lew. Let him alone , There 's nothing that allayes an angrie mindSo soone as a sweet beautie ; hee'l come to us .
Brisac , Charles .
My father 's here , my brother too ! that 's a wonder , Broke like a spirit from his Cell. Bri. Come hither , Come neerer Charles ; 'T was your desire to seeMy noble Daughter , and the company , And give your brother joy , and then to seal boy.You doe like a good brother. Lew. Marry do 's heAnd he shall have my love for ever for't.Put to your hand now. Not. Here 's the Deed Sir , ready .
No , you must pardon me a while , I tell ye , I am in contemplation , doe not trouble me .
Come , leave thy studie , Charles. Cha. Ile leave my life first ; I studie now to be a man , I 've found it.Before , what man was , was but my argument .
I like this best of all , he has taken fire , His dull mist flies away. Eust. Will you write brother ?
No , brother no , I have no time for poore things , I 'm taking th ' height of that bright Constellation .
I say , you trifle time , Son. Cha. I will not seale , Sir ; I am your eldest , and Ile keepe my birthright , For heaven forbid I should become example ; Had y'onely shew 'd me Land , I had deliver 'd it , And been a proud man to have parted with it ; Tis dirt , and labour ; Doe I speak right Uncle ?
Bravely my boy , and blesse thy tongue. Char. Ile forward , But you have open 'd to me such a treasure , I find my mind free , heaven direct my fortune .
Can he speak now ? Is this a son to sacrifice ?
Such an inimitable piece of beautyThat I have studyed long , and now found onely , That Ile part sooner with my soul of reason , And be a plant , a beast , a fish , a flie , And onely make the number of things upThan yeeld one foot of Land , if she be ty 'd to't .
Speake such another Ode , and take all yet.What say ye to the Scholar now ? Ang. I wonder ; Is he your brother , Sir ? Bust. Yes , would he were buried , I feare hee'l make an asse of me a younger .
Speake not so softly Sir , tis very likely .
Come leave your finical talke , and let 's dispatch , Charles .
Dispatch ? What ? Bri. Why the land. Cha. You are deceiv 'd , Sir , Now I perceive what 't is that woes a woman , And what maintaines her when shee 's woo 'd : Ile stop here.A wilfull poverty nere made a beauty , Nor want of meanes maintain 'd it vertuously : Though land and monies be no happinesse , Yet they are counted good additions.That use Ile make ; He that neglects a blessing , Though he want present knowledge how to use it , Neglects himself ; May be I have done you wrong Lady , Whose love and hope went hand in hand together ; May be my brother , that has long expectedThe happie houre and blest my ignorance ; Pray give me leave Sir , I shall cleare all doubts.Why did they shew me you ? Pray tell me that ? ( Mir. Hee'l talke thee into a pension for thy knaverie )
You happie you , why did you breake unto me ? The rosie sugred morne nere broke so sweetly : I am a man , and have desires within me , Affections too , though they were drown 'd a while , And lay dead , till the Spring of beautie rais 'd them ; Till I saw those eyes , I was but a lump ; A Chaos of confusedness dwelt in me ; Then from those eyes shot Love , and he distinguisht , And into forme he drew my faculties ; And now I know my Land , and now I love too .
We had best remove the Maide. Cha. It is too late Sir.I have her figure here. Nay frowne not Eustace , There are lesse worthie soules for younger brothers ; This is no forme of silk but sanctitie , Which wilde lascivious hearts can never dignifie.Remove her where you will , I walk along still ; For like the light we make no separation ; You may sooner part the billowes of the Sea , And put a barre betwixt their fellowships , Than blot out my remembrance ; sooner shutOld time into a Den , and stay his motion , Wash off the swift houres from his downie wings , Or steale eternitie to stop his glasse , Than shut the sweet Idea I have in me.Roome for an elder brother , pray give place , Sir .
Has studied duel too , take heed , hee'l beat thee.Has frighted the old Justice into a fever ; I hope hee'l disinherit him too for an asse ; For though he be grave with yeeres , hee 's a great babie .
Doe not you think me mad ? Ang. No certain , Sir , I have heard nothing from you but things excellent .
You looke upon my cloathes and laugh at me , My scurvie clothes ! Ang. They have rich linings Sir.I would your brother -- Cha. His are gold and gawdie .
But touch 'em inwardlie , they smell of Copper .
Can ye love me ? I am an heire , sweet Ladie , How ever I appeare a poore dependant ; Love you with honour , I shall love so ever ; Is your eye ambitious ? I may be a great man.Is't wealth or lands you covet ? my father must dye .
That was well put in , I hope hee'l take it deepely .
Old men are not immortal , as I take it ; Is it , you looke for , youth and handsomness ? I doe confess my brother 's a handsome Gentleman , But he shall give me leave to lead the way Ladie , Can you love for love , and make that the reward ? The old man shall not love his heapes of goldWith a more doting superstition , Than Ile love you. The young man his delights , The merchant when he ploughs the angrie sea up , And sees the mountaine billows failling on him , As if all Elements , and all their angersWere turn 'd into one vow 'd destruction ; Shall not with greater joy embrace his safetie.Wee'l live together like two wanton Vines , Circling our soules and loves in one another , Wee'l spring together and weel beare one fruit ; One joy shall make us smile , and one griefe mourne ; One age go with us , and one houre of deathShall shut our eyes , and one grave make us happie .
And one hand scale the match , Ime yours for ever .
Nay , stay , stay , stay. Ang. Nay certainly , tis done Sir .
There was a contract. Ang. Onely conditional , That if he had the Land , he had my love too ; This Gentleman 's the heire , and hee 'll maintaine it.Pray be not angrie Sir at what I say ; Or if you be , tis at your owne adventure.You have the out side of a pretty Gentleman , But by my troth you [ r ] inside is but barren ; Tis not a face I onely am in love with , Nor will I say your face is excellent , A reasonable hunting face to Court the winde with ; Nor th'are not words unlesse they be well plac 'd too , Nor your sweete Dam-mes , nor your hired verses , Nor telling me of Cloathes , nor Coach and horses , No nor your visits each day in new suites , Nor you [ r ] black patches you weare variouslie , Some cut like starres , some in halfe Moones , some Lozenges , ( All which but shew you still a younger brother . )
Gramercie Wench , thou hast a noble soule too .
Nor you [ r ] long travailes , not your little knowledge , Can make me doate upon you. Faith goe studie , And gleane some goodness , that you may shew manlie ; Your Brother at my suit Ime sure will teach you ; Or onely studie how to get a wife Sir , Y'are cast far behind , tis good you should be melancholie , It shewes like a Gamester that had lost his money , And t'is the fashon to weare your arme in a skarfe Sir , For you have had a shrewd cut ore the fingers .
But are y ' in earnest ? Ang. Yes , beleeve me father , You shall nere choose for me , y'are old and dim Sir , And th ' shaddow of the earth ecclips 'd your judgement , Y'have had your time without controwle deare father , And you must give me leave to take mine now Sir .
This is the last time of asking , Will you set your hand to ?
This is the last time of answering , I will never .
Out of my doores. Char. Most willingly. Miram. He shall Jew , Thou of the Tribe of Man-y-asses Coxcombe , And never trouble thee more till thy chops be cold foole .
Must I be gone too ? Lew. I will never know thee .
Then this man will ; what fortune he shall run , father , Bee't good or bad , I must partake it with him .
Egremont.When shall the Masque begins ? Eust. Tis done alreadie , All , all , is broken off , I am undone friend , My brother 's wise againe , and has spoil 'd all , Will not release the land , has wone the Wench too .
Could he not stay till th ' Masque was past ? W'are ready.What a skirvie trick 's this ? Mir. O you may vanish , Performe it at some Hall , where the Citizens wivesMay see't for six pence a peece , and a cold supper.Come let 's goe Charles ; And now my noble Daughter , Ile sell the tiles of my house ere thou shall want Wench.Rate up your dinner Sir , and sell it cheape , Some younger brother will take 't up in commodities.Send you joy , Nephew Eustace , if you studie the Law , Keep your great pippin-pies , they'l goe far with ye .
Ide have your blessing. Bri. No , no , meet me no more , Farewell , thou wilt blast mine eyes else. Cha. I will not .
Nor send not you for Gownes. Ang. Ile weare course flannel first .
Come let 's goe take some counsel. Lew. Tis too late .
Then stay and dine , It may be we shall vexe 'em. Exeunt .
Brisac , Eustace , Egremont , Cowsy.Nere talke to me , you are no men but Masquers , Shapes , shadowes , and the signes of men , Court bubbles , That every breath or breakes or blowes away , You have no soules , no metal in your bloods , No heat to stir ye when ye have occasion , Frozen dull things that must be turn 'd with leavers ; Are you the Courtiers and the travail 'd Gallants ? The spritely fellowes , that the people talk of ? Ye have no more Spirit than three sleepy sops .
What would ye have me doe , Sir ? Bri. Follow your brother , And get ye out of doores , and seeke your fortune , Stand still becalm 'd , and let an aged Dotard , A haire-brain 'd puppie , and a bookish boy , That never knew a blade above a penknife , And how to cut his meat in Characters , Crosse my designe , and take thine owne Wench from thee , In mine owne house too ? Thou dispis 'd poore fellow !
The reverence that I ever bare to you Sir , Then to my Uncle , with whom't had been but sawcinesseT'have been so rough -- Egre. And we not seeing himStrive in his owne cause , that was principal , And should have led us on , thought it ill mannersTo begin a quarrel here. Bri. You dare doe nothing.Doe you make your care the excuse of your cowardlinesse ? Three boyes on hobbie-horses with three penny halberts , Would beat you all. Cow. You must not say so. Bri. Yes , And sing it too. Cow. You are a man of peace , Therefore we must give way. Bri. Ile make my way ; And therefore quickly leave me , or Ile force you ; And having first torne off your flaunting feathers , Ile tramble on 'em ; and if that can not teach youTo quit my house , Ile kick ye out of my gates ; You gawdie glow-wormes carrying seeming fire , Yet have no heat within ye. Cow. O blest travaile ! How much we owe thee for our power to suffer ?
Some spleenative youths now that had never seenMore than thy Countrie smoak , will grow in choler.It would shew fine in us. Eust. Yes marry would it , That are prime Courtiers , and must know no angers , But give thankes for our injuries , if we purposeTo hold our places. Bri. Will you find the doore ? And finde it suddenlie , you shall lead the way , Sir , With your perfum 'd retinew , and coverThe now lost Angellina , or build on it , I will adopt some beggers doubtful issueBefore thou shall inherit. Eust. Wee'l to councel , And what may be done by mans wit or valourWee'l put in execution. Bri. Doe , or neverHope I shall know thee. Le. O Sir , have I found you ? [ Exeunt .
I never hid my selfe , whence flows this fury ? With which as it appeares , you come to fright me .
I smell a plot , meere conspiracyAmong ye all to defeate me of my daughter , And if she be not suddenly delivered , Untainted in her reputation too , The best of France shall know how I am juggled with.She is my heire , and if she may be ravishtThus from my care , farewel Nobilitie ; Honour and blood are meer neglected nothings .
Miramont , Andrew.Do they chafe roundly ? And. As they were rubb 'd with soap , Sir , And now they sweare alowd , now calme again , Like a ring of bells whose sound the wind still alters , And then they sit in councel what to doe , And then they jar againe what shall be done ; They talke of Warrants from the Parliament , Complaints to the King , and forces from the Province , They have a thousand heads in a thousand minutes , Yet nere a one head worth a head of garlick .
Long may they chafe , and long may we laugh at 'em , A couple of pure puppies yok 'd together.But what sayes the young Courtier Master Eustace , And his two warlike friends ? And. They say but little , How much they think I know not ; they looke ruefully , As if they had newly come from a vaulting house , And had beene quite shot through 'tween winde and waterBy a she Dunkirke , and had sprung a leake , Sir.Certaine my master was too blame. Mir. Why Andrew ?
To take away the Wench oth ' sudden from him , And give him no lawful warning , he is tender ; And of a young girles constitution , Sir , Readie to get the greene sickness with conceit ; Had he but tane his leave innavailing language , Or bought an Elegie of his condolement , That th ' world might have tane notice , he had beeneAn Asse , 't had beene some favour. Mir. Thou sayest true , Wise Andrew , but these Schollars are such thingsWhen they can prattle. And. Very parlous things Sir .
And when they gaine the Libertie to distinguishThe difference 'twixt a father and a foole , To looke below and spie a younger brotherPruning up and dressing up his expectationsIn a rare glasse of beauty , too good for him : Those dreaming Scholars then turne Tyrants , Andrew , And shew no mercy. And. The more 's the pittie , Sir .
Thou told'st me of a trick to catch my brother , And anger him a little farther , Andrew , It shall be onely anger I assure thee , And little shame. And. And I can fit you , Sir ; Hark in your eare. Mir. Thy wife ? And. So I assure ye ; This night at twelve a clock. Mir. Tis neat and handsome ; There are twentie Crownes due to thy project Andrew ; I 've time to visit Charles , and see what LectureHe reades to his Mistresse. That done , Ile not faileTo be with you. And. Nor I to watch my Master -- Exeunt .
Angellina , Sylvia , with a taper.I'me worse than ere I was ; for now I feare , That that I love , that that I onely dote on ; He followes me through every roome I passe , And with a strong set eye he gazes on me , As if his spark of innocence were blowneInto a flame of lust ; Vertue defend me.His Uncle to is absent , and 't is night ; And what these opportunities may teach him -- What feare and endlesse care tis to be honest ! To be a maide , what miserie , what mischiefe ! Would I were rid of it , so it were fairlie .
You need not feare that , will you be a childe still ? He followes you , but still to looke upon you ; Or if he did desire to lie with ye , Tis but your owne desire , you love for that end ; Ile lay my life , if he were now abed w'ye , He is so modest , he would fall a sleepe straight .
Dare you venter that ? Syl. Let him consent , and have at ye ; I feare him not , he knowes not what a woman is , Nor how to find the mysterie men aime at.Are you afraid of your own shadow , Madam ?
He followes still , yet with a sober face ; Would I might know the worst , and then I were satisfied .
You may both , and let him but goe with ye .
Why doe you fle me ? What have I so illAbout me or within me to deserve it ?
I am going to bed Sir. Cha. And I am come to light ye ; I am a maide , and 't is a maidens office .
You may have me to bed Sir , without a scruple , And yet I am charie too who comes about me.Two Innocents should not feare one another .
The Gentleman sayes true. Pluck up your heart , Madam .
The glorious Sun both rising and decliningWe boldly looke upon ; even then sweet Ladie , When like a modest bride he drawes nights curtaines , Even then he blushes , that men should behold him .
I feare he will perswade me to mistake him .
Tis easily done , if you will give your minde to't .
Pray ye to your bed. Cha. Why not to yours , dear Mistress , One heart and one bed. Ang. True Sir , when 't is lawful ; But yet you know -- Cha. I would not know , forget it ; Those are but sickly loves that hang on Ceremonie , Nurst up with doubts and feares , ours high and healthful , Full of beleefe , and fit to teach the Priest ; Love shall seale first , then hands confirme the bargaine .
I shall be an Heretique if this continue.What would you doe a bed ? you make me blush , Sir .
Ide see you sleepe , for sure your sleepes are excellentYou that are waking such a noted wonder , Must in your slumber prove an admiration : I would behold your dreames too , if't were possible ; Those were rich showes. Ang. I am becomming Traitor .
Then like blew Neptune courting of an Hand , Where all the perfumes and the pretious thingsThat wait upon great Nature are laid up , Ide clip it in mine armes , and chastly kiss it , Dwell in your bosome like your dearest thoughts , And sigh and weepe. Ang. I 've too much woman in me .
And those true teares falling on your pure Chrystals , Should turne to armelets for great Queenes 't adore .
I must be gone. Cha. Do not , I will not hurt ye ; This is to let you know , my worthiest Lady , Y'have clear 'd my mind , and I can speak of love too ; Feare not my manners , though I never knewBefore these few houres what a beautie was , And such a one that fires all hearts that feele it ; Yet I have read of vertuous temperance , And studied it among my other secrets , And sooner would I force a separationBetwixt this Spirit and the case of flesh , Than but conceive one rudeness against chastitie .
To bed , and pray then , we may have a faire endOf our faire loves ; would I [ w ] ere worthy of you , Or of such parents that might give you thankes ; But I am poore in all but in your love.Once more , good night. Cha. A good night t'ye , and mayThe dew of sleepe fall gently on you , sweet one , And lock up those faire lights in pleasing slumbers ; No dreames but chast and cleare attempt your fancie , And break betimes sweet morne , I 've lost my light else .
Let it be ever night when I lose you .
This Scholar never went to a Free-Schoo [ le ] , he 's so simple [ Enter a servant . ]
Your brother with two Gallants is at dore , SirAnd they 're so violent , they'l take no denial .
this is no time of night. Cha. Let 'em in Mistresse .
They stay no leave ; Shall I raise the house on 'm ?
Not a man , nor make no murmur of't , I charge ye .
Eustace , Egremont , Cowsy.Th'are here , my Uncle absent , stand close to me.How doe you brother with your curious story ? Have you not read her yet sufficiently ?
No , brother , no , I stay yet in the Preface ; The stile 's too hard for you. Eust. I must entreat her.Shee 's parcel of my goods. Cha. Shee 's all when you have her .
Hold off your hands , unmannerly , rude Sir ; Nor I , nor what I have depend on you .
Do , let her alone , she gives good counsel ; doe notTrouble your selfe with Ladies , they are too light ; Let out your land , and get a provident Steward .
I can not love ye , let that satisfie you ; Such vanities as you are to be laught at .
Nay , Then you must goe , I must claime mine owne .
A way , a way with her. Cha. Let her alone , [ She strikes off Eustace 's hat ] Pray let her alone , and take your coxcombe up : Let me talk civilly a while with you brother.It may be on some termes I may part with her .
But doe not kill 'em Sir. Cha. You speak too late , Deare , It is my first fight , and I must doe bravely , I must not looke with partial eyes on any ; I can not spare a button of these Gentlemen ; Did life lye in their heel Achilles like , Ide shoot my anger at those parts and kill 'um.Who waits within ? Ser. Sir. Cha. View all these , view 'em wellGoe round a bout 'em and still view their faces , Round about yet ; See how death waits upon 'em , For thou shall never view 'em more. Eust. Pray hold , Sir .
I can not hold , you stand so fair before me , I must not hold 'twill darken all my glories.Goe to my Uncle , bid him poste to the King , And get my pardon instantly , I have need o n't .
Are you so unnatural ? Cha. You shall die last Sir , Ile talke thee dead , thou art no man to fight with.Come , will ye come ? me thinkes I 've fought whole battailes .
We have no quarel to you , that we know on , Sir .
Wee'l quit the house and ask ye mercie too : Good Ladie , let no murther be done here ; We came but to parly. Cha. How my swordThirsts after them ? stand away Sweet. Eust. Pray Sir , Take my submission , and I disclaime for ever .
Away ye poore things , ye despicable Creatures ! Doe you come poste to fetch a Ladie from me , From a poore Schoole-boy that ye scorn 'd of late ? And grow lame in your hearts when you should execute ? Pray take her , take her , I am weary of her ; What did ye bring to carrie her. Egre. A Coach and four horses .
But are they good ? Egre. As good as France can shew Sir .
Are you willing to leave those , and take your safeties ? Speak quickly. Eust. Yes with all our hearts. Cha. Tis done then.Many have got one horse , I 've got foure by th ' bargaine .
Miramont .
How Now , who 's here. Ser. Nay Now , y'are gon without bail .
What , drawne my friends ! Fetch me my two-hand sword ; I will not leave a head on your shoulders , Wretches .
In troth Sir , I came but to doe my dutie .
And we to renew our loves. Mir. Bring me a blanket.What came they for ? Ang. To borrow me a while , Sir ; But one that never fought yet has so curried , So bastina [ d ] o 'd them with manly carriage , They stand like things Gorgon had turn 'd to stone ; They watch 'd your being absent , and then thoughtThey might doe wonders here , and they have done so ? For by my troth , I wonder at their coldness , The nipping North or frost never came neere them , St. George upon a Signe would grow more sensible : If the name of honour were for ever to be lost , These were the most sufficient men to doe itIn all the world , and yet they are but young , What will they rise to ? They 're as full of fireAs a frozen Glo-wormes ratle , and shine as goodly ; Nobilitie and patience are match 'd rarelyIn these three Gentlemen , they have right use o n't ; They'l stand still for an houre and be beaten.These are the Anagrammes of three great Worthies .
They will infect my house with cowardize , If they breathe longer in it ; my roofe coversNo baffl 'd Monsieurs , walk and aire your selves ; As I live , they stay not here , while liver 'd wretchesWithout one word to ask a reason why , Vanish , 't is the last warning , and with speed , For if I take ye in hand I shall dissect you , And read upon your flegmatick dull carcases.My horse againe there : I have other business , Which you shall heare hereafter and laugh at it.Good night Charles , faire goodness to you dear LadieTis late , 't is late. Ang. Pray Sir be careful of us .
It is enough , my best care shall attend ye. Exeunt .
Well done , well done , give me my night-cap. So.Quick , quick , untruss me ; I will truss and trounce thee ; Come Wench a kiss between each point ; kiss close ; It is a sweet Parenthesis. Lil. Y'are merry Sir .
Merry I will be anon , and thou shall feele it , Thou shall my Lilly. Lil. Shall I aire your bed , Sir ?
No , no , Ile use no warming pan but thine , Girle ; That 's all ; Come kiss me again. Lil. Ha'ye done yet ?
No , but I will doe , and doe wonders , Lilly.Shew me the way. Lil. You can not misse it , Sir ; You shall have a Cawdle in the morning , forYour worships breakfast. Bri. How , ith ' morning. Lilly ? Th'art such a wittie thing to draw me on.Leave fooling , Lilly , I am hungry now , And th ' hast another Kickshaw , I must tast it .
Twill make you surfet , I am tender of you : Y'have all y'are like to have. And. And can this be earnest ?
it seemes so , and she honest. Bri. Have I notThy promise Lilly ? Lil. Yes and I have performedEnough to a man of your yeares , this is truth , And you shall find Sir , you have kist and tows 'd me , Handled my legg and foote , what would you more , Sir , ? As for the rest , it requires youth and strength , And the labour in an old man would breed Agues , Sciaticaes , and Cramps ; you shall not curse me , For taking from you what you can not spare , Sir : Be good unto your selfe , y'ave tane alreadieAll you can take with ease ; you are past threshing , It is a worke too boisterous for you ; leaveSuch drudgerie to Andrew. Mir. How she jeeres him ?
Let Andrew alone with his owne tillage , Hee 's tough , and can manure it. Bri. Y'are a queane , A scoffing jeering quean. Lil. It may be so , butI'me sure , Ile nere be yours. Bri. Doe not provoke me , If thou do'st , Ile have my Farm againe , and turneThee out a begging. Lil. Though you have the will , And want of honestie to deny your Deed , Sir , Yet I hope Andrew has got so much learningFrom my young Master , as to keep his own ; At the worst , Ile tell a short tale to the Judges , For what grave ends you sign 'd your Lease , and onWhat termes you would revoke it. Bri. Whore thou dar'st not.Yeeld or Ile have thee whipt ; How my bloud boiles , As if t'were ore a furnace ! Mir. I shall coole it .
Yet gentle Lilly , pitie and forgive me , Ile be a friend t'ye , such a loving bountiful friend --
To avoid suites in Law , I would grant a litle , But should fierce Andrew know it , what would becomeOf me ? And. A whore , a whore ! Bri. Nothing but well Wench , I will put such a strong bit in his mouth , As thou shalt ride him how thou wilt , my Lilly : Nay , he shall hold the doore , as I will worke him , And thank thee for the office. Mir. Take heed Andrew , These are shrewd temptations. And. Pray you knowYour Cue , and second me Sir ; By your Worships favour .
Andrew ! And. I come in time to take possessionOf th ' office you assigne me ; hold the doore , Alas 't is nothing for a simple manTo stay without when a deepe understandingHolds conference within , say with his wife : A trifle Sir , I know I hold my farmeIn Cuckolds Tenure : you are Lord o'the soile Sir,
is a Weft , a Straie shee 's yours , to use Sir , I claime no interest in her. Bri. Art thou serious ? Speak honest Andrew , since thou hast oreheard us , And wink at small faults , man ; I'me but a pidler , A little will serve my turne ; thou'lt finde enoughWhen I 've my bellyfull ; wilt thou be privateAnd silent ? And. By all meanes , Ile onely haveA Ballad made of't , sung to some lewd Tune , And the name of it shall be Justice Trap , It will sell rarely with your Worships name , And Lillies on the top. Bri. Seek not the ruineO ' my reputation , Andrew. And. Tis for your credit , Monsieur Brisac printed in capital letters , Then pasted upon all the posts in Paris .
No mercy , Andrew ? And. O , it will proclaim youFrom th ' Citie to the Court , and prove sport royal .
Thou shall keep thy Farm. Mir. He does afflict him rarely .
You trouble me. Then his intent arriving , The vizard of his hypocrisie poll 'd offTo the Judge criminal. Bri. O , I am undone .
Hee 's put out of Commission with disgrace , And held uncapable of bearing OfficeEver hereafter. This is my revenge , And this Ile put in practice. Bri. Doe but heare me .
To bring me back from my Grammer to my horne-book , It is unpardonable. Bri. Do not play the Tyrant ; Accept of composition. Lil. Heare him , Andrew .
What composition ? Bri. Ile confirme thy farme , And add unto't an hundred acres moreAdjoyning to it. And. Umb , This mollifies , But y'are so fickle : and will again denie this , There being no witness by. Bri. Call any witness , Ile presently assure it. And. Say you so , Troth there 's a friend of mine Sir , within hearing , That is familiar with all that 's past , His testimonie will be authentical .
will he be secret ? And. You may tye his tongue up.As you would doe your purse-strings. Br. Miramont. M. Ha , Ha , Ha .
this is my witness. Lord how you are troubled ? Sure , y'have an ague , you shake so with choler ; Hee 's your loving brother Sir , and will tell no bodieBut all he meets , that you have eate a snake , And are grown young , gamesom , and rampant. Bri. Caught thus ?
If he were one that would make jests of you , Or plague ye with making your religious gravitieRidiculous to your neighbours , Then you hadSome cause to be perplex'd. Bri. I shall becomeDiscourse for Clowns and Tapsters. And. Quick , Lilly , Quick , Hee 's now past kissing , between point and point.He swounds , fetch him some Cordiall -- Now put in Sir .
Who may this be ? sure this is some mistake : Let me see his face , weares he not a false beard ? It can not be Brisac that worthie Gentleman , The pillar and the patron of his Countrie ; He is too prudent and too cautelous , Experience hath taught him t'avoid these fooleries , He is the punisher and not the doer , Besides hee 's old and cold , unfit for woman ; This is some Counterfeit , he shall be whipt for't , Some base abuser of my worthie brother .
Open the doores , will ye'imprison me ? are ye my Judges ?
The man raves ! This is not judicious Brisac : Yet now I think o n't , a ' has a kinde of dog lookeLike my brother , a guiltie hanging face .
Ile suffer bravely , doe your worst , doe , doe .
Why , it 's manly in you. Bri. Nor will I raile nor curse , You slave , you whore , I will not meddle with you , But all the torments that ere fell on men , That fed on mischiefe , fall heavily on you all. Exit .
You have giv'n him a heat , Sir. Mir. He will ride youThe better , Lil. And. Wee'l teach him to meddle with Scholars .
he shall make good his promise t'increase thy Farm , AndrewOr Ile jeere him to death , feare nothing Lilly , I am thy Champion. This jeast goes to Charles , And then Ile hunt him out , and Monsieur EustaceThe gallant Courtier , and laugh heartilyTo see 'm mourne together. And. Twill be rare , Sir. Exeunt .
Eustace , Egremont. Cowsy.Turn 'd out of doores and baffled ! Egre. We share with youIn the affront. Cow. Yet beare it not like youWith such dejection. Eust. My Coach and horses madeThe ransome of our cowardize. Lew. Cow. Pish , that 's nothing , Tis Damnum reparabile , and soone recover 'd .
It is but feeding a suitor with false hopes , And after squeeze him with a dozen of oathes.You are new rigg 'd , and this no more remembred .
Nor can I change my copy , if I purposeTo be of your society. Egre. By no meanes .
Honour is nothing with you ? Cow. A meere bubble , For what 's growne common , is no more regarded .
My sword forc 'd from me too , and still detain 'd , You think 's no blemish. Egre. Get me a battoone ? Tis twenty times more courtlike , and less trouble .
And yet you weare a sword. Cow. Yes , and a good one , A Millan hilt , and a Damasco blade , For ornament , no use the Court allowes it .
Wil't not fight of it selfe ? Cow. I nere tri 'd this , Yet I have worne as faire as any man , I'me sure I 've made my Cutler rich , and paidFor several weapons , Turkish and Toledo 's , Two thousand Crownes , and yet could never lightUpon a fighting one. Eust. Ile borrow this , I like it well. Cow. Tis at your service Sir , A lath in a velvet scabbard will serve my turne .
And now I have it leave me ; y'are infectious , The plague and leprosie of your baseness spreadingOn all that doe come neere you ; such as youRender the Throne of Majesty , the CourtSuspected and contemptible , you are Scarabee'sThat batten in her dung , and have no pallatsTo taste her curious viands , and like OwlesCan onely see her night deformities , But with the glorious splendor of her beautiesYou are struck blinde as Moles , that undermineThe sumptuous building that allow 'd you shelter , You stick like running ulcers on her face , And taint the pureness of her native candor , And being bad servants , cause your masters goodnessTo be disputed of ; you make the CourtThat is the abstract of all Academies , To teach and practice noble undertakings , ( Where courage sits triumphant crown 'd with Lawrel , And wisedome loaded with the weight of honour ) A Schoole of vices. Egre. What sudden rapture 's this ?
A heavenly one that raising me from sloth and ignorance , ( In which your conversation long hath charm 'd me ) Carries me up into the aire of action , And knowledge of my selfe ; even now I feeleBut pleading onely in the Courts defence , ( Though far [ r ] e short of her merits and bright lustre ) A happy alteration , and full strengthTo stand her Champion against all the world , That throw aspersions on her. Cow. Sure hee'l beat us , I see it in his eyes. Egre. A second Charles ; Pray look not Sir so furiously. Eust. RecantWhat you have said , ye Mungrils , and licke upThe vomit you have cast upon the Court , Where you unworthily have had warmth and breeding , And sweare that you like Spiders , have made poysonOf that which was a saving antidote .
We will sweare any thing. Cow. We honour the CourtAs a most sacred place. Egre. And will make oath , If you enjoyne us to't , nor knave nor fool , Nor Coward living in it. Eust. Except you two , You Rascals ! Cow. Yes , we are all these , and more , If you will have it so. Eust. And that untilYou are again reform 'd and growne new men , You nere presume to name the Court , or presseInto the Porters Lodge but for a penance , To be disciplin 'd for your roguery , and this doneWith true contrition. Both. Yes Sir. Eust. You againeMay eat scraps and be thankful. Cow. Here 's a cold breakfastAfter a sharpe nights walking. Eust. Keepe your oathes , And without grumbling vanish. Both. We are gone , Sir. Exeunt .
O much , Sir , here I end not , but begin ; I must speak to you in another straine , Than yet I ever us 'd , and if the languageAppeare in the delivery rough and harsh , You ( being my Tutor ) must condemne your selfe , From whom I learn 'd it. Cha. When I understand ( Bee't in what stile you please ) what 's your demand , I shall endeavour in the self same phraseTo make an answer to the point. Eust. I come notTo lay claime to your birthright , 't is your owne , And 't is fit you enjoy it , nor ask I from youYour learning and deepe knowledge ; ( though I am notA Schollar as you are ) I know them DiamondsBy your sole industry , patience and labourForc 'd from steepe rocks , and with much toile attended , And but to few that prize their value granted , And therefore without rival freely weare them .
With much unwillingness with you , but ifThere 's no evasion -- Eust. None. Cha. Heare yet a wordAs for the sword and other fripperies , In a faire way send for them , you shall have 'em.But rather than surrender Angellina , Or heare it againe mention 'd , I opposeMy breast unto lowd thunder , cast behinde meAll ties of Nature. Eust. She detain 'd , I'me deafeTo all perswasion. Cha. Guard thy selfe then Eustace , I use no other Rhetorick. Mir. Clashing of swords [ Enter Miram. ] So neere my house ? brother oppos 'd to brother ! Here is no fencing at halfe sword ; hold , hold,
Eust. Second him , or call in more helpe.Come not betweene us , Ile not know nor spare you ; D 'ye fight by th ' booke ? Cha. Tis you that wrong me , off Sir , And suddenly , Ile conjure down the SpiritThat I have raised in him. Eust. Never , Charles , Tis thine , and in thy death , be doubled in me .
Sure Sir , I shall not need addition from him .
It shall be Hearts-ease , Eustace , ere I 've done ; As for thy fathers anger , now thou dar'st fight , Nere feare't , for I 've the dowcets of his gravityFast in a string , I will so pinch and wring him , That spight of his authority , thou shalt makeThine owne conditions with him. Eust. Ile take leaveA little to consider. Cha. Here comes Andrew .
But without his Comical and learned face ; What sad disaster , Andrew ? And. You may read Sir , A Tragedy in my face. Mir. Art thou in earnest ?
Yes , by my life Sir , and if now you help not , And speedily , by force or by persuasion , My good old Master ( for now I pitie him ) isRuin 'd for ever. Cha. Ha , my father ! And. He Sir .
By what meanes ? speake. And. At the suit of Monsieur LewisHis house is seiz 'd upon , and he in personIs under guard , ( I saw it with these eyes Sir ) To be convey 'd to Paris , and there sentenc 'd .
Nay , then there is no jesting. Cha. Doe I live , And know my father injur 'd ? And. And what 's worse Sir , My Lady Angellina -- Eust. What of her ?
And if I follow not , a Cowards nameBe branded on my forehead. Cha. This Spirit makes youA sharer in my fortunes. Mir. And in mine , Of which ( Brisac once freed , and AngellinaAgain in our possession ) you shall knowMy heart speakes in my tongue. Eust. I dare not doubt it , Sir .
Lewis , Brisac , Angellina , Sylvia , Officers .
I'me deafe to all perswasions. Bri. I use none , Nor doubt I , though a while my innocence suffers , But when the King shall understand how falseYour malice hath inform 'd him , he in justiceMust set me right againe. Ang. Sir , let not passionSo far [ r ] e transport you as to think in reason , This violent course repaires , but ruins it ; That honour you would build up , you destroy ; What you would seeme to nourish , if respectOf my preferment or my paternMay challenge your paternal love and care , Why doe you , now good fortune has providedA better husband for me than your hopesCould ever fancy , strive to robb me of him ? In what is my Lord Charles defective Sir ? Unless deep learning be a blemish in him , Or well proportion 'd limbs be mulcts in Nature , Or what you onely aim 'd at , large revenewesAre on the sudden growne distastful to you , Of what can you accuse him ? Lew. Of a rapeDone to honour , which thy ravenous lustMade the consent to. Syl. Her lust ! you are her father .
And you her Bawd. Syl. Were you ten Lords , 't is false , The pureness of her chaste thoughts entertains notSuch spotted instruments. Ang. As I have a soule Sir .
I am not to be alter 'd ; to sit downeWith this disgrace , would argue me a Peasant , And not borne noble : all rigour that the LawAnd that encrease of power by favour yeelds , Shall be with all severity inflicted ; You have the Kings hand for't ; no Bayle will serve , And therefore at your perils Officers , away with 'em .
This is madness. Lew. Tell me so in open Court , And there Ile answer you. Mir. Well overtaken ; [ Enter Mir. Char. Eust. Andrew . ]
Ill if they dare resist. Eust. He that advancesBut one step forward dies. L. Shew the King 's Writ .
Shew your discretion , 'twil become you better .
Y'are once more in my power , and if againeI part with you , let me for ever lose thee .
Force will not do't nor threats ; accept this serviceFrom your despair 'd of Eustace. And. And bewareYour reverend Worship never more attemptTo search my Lilly-pot , you see what followes .
Is the Kings power contemn 'd ? Mir. No , but the torrentO ' your wilful folly stopp'd. And for you , good Sir , If you would but be sensible , what can you wishBut the satisfaction of an obstinate Will.That is not indear 'd to you ? rather thanBe cross 'd in what you purpos 'd , you'l undoeYour daughters fame , the credit of your judgement , And your old foolish neighbour ; make your states , And in a suite not worth a Cardecue , A prey to advocates , and their buckram Scribes , And after they have plum 'd ye , returne homeLike a couple of naked Fowles without a feather .

Lovelesses , Savil the Steward , and a Page .
Brother , is your last hope past to mollifie Morecraftsheart about your Morgage ?
Hopelesly past : I have presented the Usurer with a richerdraught than ever Cleopatra swallowed ; he hath suckt in ten thousandpounds worth of my Land , more than he paid for at a gulp , withoutTrumpets .
I have as hard a task to perform in this house .
Faith mine was to make an Usurer honest , or to lose my Land .
And mine is to perswade a passionate woman , or to leave theLand. Make the boat stay , I fear I shall begin my unfortunate journey thisnight , though the darkness of the night and the roughness of the watersmight easily disswade an unwilling man .
Sir , your Fathers old friends hold it the sounder course for yourbody and estate to stay at home and marry , and propagate and govern in ourCountry , than to Travel and die without issue .
Savil , you shall gain the opinion of a better servant , inseeking to execute , not alter my will , howsoever my intents succeed .
Yonder 's Mistres Younglove , Brother , the grave rubber of yourMistresses toes .
Younglove the waiting woman .
Mistres Younglove .
Master Loveless , truly we thought your sails had been hoist : myMistres is perswaded you are Sea-sick ere this .
Loves she her ill taken up resolution so dearly ? Didst thou moveher from me ?
By this light that shines , there 's no removing her , if she get astiffe opinion by the end. I attempted her to day when they say a womancan deny nothing .
What critical minute was that ?
When her smock was over her ears : but she was no more pliant thanif it hung about her heels .
I prethee deliver my service , and say , I desire to see the dearcause of my banishment ; and then for France .
I'le do't : hark hither , is that your Brother ?
Yes , have you lost your memory ?
As I live he 's a pretty fellow. [ Exit .
O this is a sweet Brache .
Why she knows not you .
No , but she offered me once to know her : to this day she lovesyouth of Eighteen ; she heard a tale how Cupid struck her in love with agreat Lord in the Tilt-yard , but he never saw her ; yet she in kindnesswould needs wear a Willow-garland at his Wedding. She lov 'd all thePlayers in the last Queens time once over : she was struck when they actedLovers , and forsook some when they plaid Murthers. She has nine
, and the servants say she hoards old gold ; and she her selfpronounces angerly , that the Farmers eldest son , or her Mistres HusbandsClerk shall be , that Marries her , shall make her a joynture of fourscorepounds a year ; she tells tales of the serving-men .
Enough , I know her Brother. I shall intreat you only to salutemy Mistres , and take leave , we'l part at the Stairs .
Now Sir , this first part of your will is performed : what 's therest ?
First , let me beg your notice for this Gentleman my Brother .
I shall take it as a favour done to me , though the Gentleman hathreceived but an untimely grace from you , yet my charitable dispositionwould have been ready to have done him freer courtesies as a stranger , than upon those cold commendations .
Lady , my salutations crave acquaintance and leave at once .
Sir I hope you are the master of your own occasions. [ Exit Yo. Lo. and Savil .
Would I were so. Mistris , for me to praise over again thatworth , which all the world , and you your self can see .
It 's a cold room this , Servant .
Mistris .
What think you if I have a Chimney for't , out here ?
Mistris , another in my place , that were not tyed to believe allyour actions just , would apprehend himself wrong 'd : But I whose vertuesare constancy and obedience .
Younglove , make a good fire above to warm me after my servants
I have heard and seen your affability to be such , that theservants you give wages to may speak .
'T is true , 't is true ; but they speak to th ' purpose .
Mistris , your will leads my speeches from the purpose. But as aman --
A Simile servant ? This room was built for honest meaners , thatdeliver themselves hastily and plainly , and are gone. Is this a time orplace for Exordiums , and Similes and Metaphors ? If you have ought tosay , break into't : my answers shall very reasonably meet you .
Mistris I came to see you .
That 's happily dispatcht , the next .
To take leave of you .
To be gone ?
Yes .
You need not have despair 'd of that , nor have us 'd so manycircumstances to win me to give you leave to perform my command ; is therea third ?
Yes , I had a third had you been apt to hear it .
I ? Never apter. Fast ( good servant ) fast .
'T was to intreat you to hear reason .
Most willingly , have you brought one can speak it ?
Lastly , it is to kindle in that barren heart love andforgiveness .
You would stay at home ?
Yes Lady .
Why you may , and doubtlesly will , when you have debated that yourcommander is but your Mistris , a woman , a weak one , wildly overborn with
cliffe , passing in a poor Water-house ; the dangers of the mercilessChannel 'twixt that and Callis , five long hours sail , with three poorweeks victuals .
You wrong me .
Then to land dumb , unable to enquire for an English hoast , to removefrom City to City , by most chargeable Post-horse , like one that rode inquest of his Mother tongue .
You wrong me much .
And all these ( almost invincible labours ) performed for yourMistris , to be in danger to forsake her , and to put on new allegeance tosome French Lady , who is content to change language with your laughter , and after your whole year spent in Tennis and broken speech , to stand tothe hazard of being laught at , at your return , and have tales made on youby the Chamber-maids .
You wrong me much .
Louder yet .
You know your least word is of force to make me seek outdangers , move me not with toyes : but in this banishment , I must take leaveto say , you are unjust : was one kiss forc't from you in publick by me sounpardonable ? Why all the hours of day and night have seen us kiss .
'T is true , and so you told the company that heard me chide .
Your own eyes were not dearer to you than I .
And so you told 'em .
I did , yet no sign of disgrace need to have stain 'd your
and free from the least baseness .
I did : But if a Maids heart doth but once think that she issuspected , her own face will write her guilty .
But where lay this disgrace ? The world that knew us , knew ourresolutions well : And could it be hop 'd that I should give away myfreedom ; and venture a perpetual bondage with one I never kist ? or could Iin strict wisdom take too much love upon me , from her that chose me forher Husband ?
Believe me ; if my Wedding-smock were on , Were the Gloves bought and given , the Licence come , Were the Rosemary-branches dipt , and allThe Hipochrist and Cakes eat and drunk off , Were these two armes incompast with the handsOf Bachelors to lead me to the Church , Were my feet in the door , were I John , said , If John should boast a favour done by me , I would not wed that year : And you I hope , When you have spent this year commodiously , In atchieving Languages , will at your returnAcknowledge me more coy of parting with mine eyes , Than such a friend : More talk I hold not nowIf you dare go .
I dare , you know : First let me kiss .
Farewel sweet Servant , your task perform 'd , On a new ground as a beginning Sutor , I shall be apt to hear you .
Farewel cruel Mistres. [ Exit Lady .
Brother you'l hazard the losing your tide to Gravesend : youhave a long half mile by Land to Greenewich ?
I go : but Brother , what yet unheard of course to live , dothyour imagination flatter you with ? Your ordinary means are devour 'd .
Course ? why Horse-coursing I think. Consume no time in this : Ihave no Estate to be mended by meditation : he that busies himself about myfortunes may properly be said to busie himself about nothing .
Yet some course you must take , which for my satisfactionresolve and open ; if you will shape none , I must inform you that that manbut perswades himself he means to live , that imagines not the means .
Why live upon others , as others have lived upon me .
I apprehend not that : you have fed others , and consequentlydispos 'd of 'em : and the same measure must you expect from yourmaintainers , which will be too heavy an alteration for you to bear .
Why I'le purse ; if that raise me not , I'le bet atBowling-alleyes , or man Whores ; I would fain live by others : but I'le livewhilst I am unhang 'd , and after the thought 's taken .
I see you are ty 'd to no particular imploiment then ?
Faith I may choose my course : they say nature brings forthnone but she provides for them : I'le try her liberality .
Well , to keep your feet out of base and dangerous paths , Ihave resolved you shall live as Master of my House. It shall be your care
to see him fed and cloathed , not according to his present Estate , but to his birth and former fortunes .
If it be refer 'd to him , if I be not found in CarnationJearsie-stockins , blew devils breeches , with the gards down , and my pocketi'th ' sleeves , I'le n'er look you i'th ' face again .
A comelier wear I wuss it is than those dangling slops .
To keep you readie to do him all service peaceably , and him tocommand you reasonably , I leave these further directions in writing , whichat your best leasure together open and read .
Younglove to them with a Jewell .
Sir , my Mistress commends her love to you in this token , and thesewords ; it is a Jewell ( she sayes ) which as a favour from her she wouldrequest you to wear till your years travel be performed : which onceexpired , she will hastily expect your happy return .
Return my service with such thanks , as she may imagine theheart of a suddenly over-joyed man would willingly utter , and you I hope Ishall with slender arguments perswade to wear this Diamond , that when myMistris shall through my long absence , and the approach of new Suitors , offer to forget me ; you may cast your eye down to your finger , andremember and speak of me : She will hear thee better than those allied bybirth to her ; as we see many men much swayed by the Grooms of theirChambers , not that they have a greater part of their love or opinion onthem , than on others , but for that they know their secrets .
O ' my credit I swear , I think 't was made for me : Fear no other Suitors .
I shall not need to teach you how to discredit theirbeginning , you know how to take exception at their shirts at washing , orto make the maids swear they found plasters in their beds .
I know , I know , and do not you fear the Suitors .
Farewell , be mindfull , and be happie ; the night calls me. [ Exeunt omnes praeter Younglove .
The Gods of the Winds befriend you Sir ; a constant and a liberalLover thou art , more such God send us .
Welford .
Let'em not stand still , we have rid .
A suitor I know by his riding hard , I'le not be seen .
A prettie Hall this , no Servant i n't ? I would look freshly .
You have delivered your errand to me then : there 's no danger in ahansome young fellow : I'le shew my self .
Lady , may it please you to bestow upon a stranger the ordinarygrace of salutation : Are you the Lady of this house ?
Sir , I am worthily proud to be a Servant of hers .
Lady , I should be as proud to be a Servant of yours , did not my solate acquaintance make me despair .
Sir , it is not so hard to atchieve , but nature may bring it about .
For these comfortable words , I remain your glad Debtor. Is yourLady at home ?
She is no stragler Sir .
May her occasions admit me to speak with her ?
If you come in the way of a Suitor , No .
I know your affable vertue will be moved to perswade her , that aGentleman benighted and strayed , offers to be bound to her for a nightslodging .
I will commend this message to her ; but if you aim at her body , youwill be deluded : other women of the household of good carriage andgovernment ; upon any of which if you can cast your affection , they willperhaps be found as faithfull and not so coy. [ Exit Younglove .
What a skin full of lust is this ? I thought I had come a wooing , and I am the courted partie. This is right Court fashion : Men , Women , andall woo , catch that catch may. If this soft hearted woman have infused anyof her tenderness into her Lady , there is hope she will be plyant. Butwho 's here ?
Sir Roger the Curate .
Gad save you Sir. My Lady lets you know she desires to beacquainted with your name , before she confer with you ?
Sir , my name calls me Welford .
Sir , you are a Gentleman of a good name. I'le try his wit .
I will uphold it as good as any of my Ancestors had this twohundred years Sir .
I knew a worshipfull and a Religious Gentleman of your name inthe Bishoprick of Durham. Call you him Cousen ?
I am only allyed to his vertues Sir .
It is modestly said : I should carry the badge of yourChristianity with me too .
What 's that , a Cross ? there 's a tester .
I mean the name which your God-fathers and God-mothers gave youat the Font .
'T is Harry : but you can not proceed orderly now in your Catechism : for you have told me who gave me that name. Shall I beg your name ?
Roger .
What room fill you in this house ?
More rooms than one .
The more the merrier : but may my boldness know , why your Lady hathsent you to decypher my name ?
Her own words were these : To know whether you were a formerlydenyed Suitor , disguised in this message : for I can assure you shedelights not in Thalame : Hymen and she are at variance , I shall returnwith much hast. [ Exit Roger .
And much speed Sir , I hope : certainly I am arrived amongst a Nationof new found fools , on a Land where no Navigator has yet planted wit ; if Ihad foreseen it , I would have laded my breeches with bells , knives , copper , and glasses , to trade with women for their virginities : yet Ifear , I should have betrayed my self to a needless charge then : here 's thewalking night-cap again .
Roger .
Sir , my Ladies pleasure is to see you : who hath commanded me toacknowledge her sorrow , that you must take the pains to come up for so badentertainment .
I shall obey your Lady that sent it , and acknowledge you thatbrought it to be your Arts Master .
I am but a Batchelor of Art , Sir ; and I have the mending of allunder this roof , from my Lady on her down-bed , to the maid in thePease-straw .
A Cobler , Sir ?
No Sir , I inculcate Divine Service within these Walls .
But the Inhabitants of this house do often imploy you on errandswithout any scruple of Conscience .
Yes , I do take the air many mornings on foot , three or four milesfor eggs : but why move you that ?
To know whether it might become your function to bid my man toneglect his horse a little to attend on me .
Most properly Sir .
I pray you doe so then : the whilst I will attend your Lady. Youdirect all this house in the true way ?
I doe Sir .
And this door I hope conducts to your Lady ?
Your understanding is ingenious. [ Ex. severally .
Loveless and Savil , with a writing .
By your favour Sir , you shall pardon me ?
I shall bear your favour Sir , cross me no more ; I say they shallcome in .
Sir , you forget who I am ?
Sir , I do not ; thou art my Brothers Steward , his cast offmill-money , his Kitchen Arithmetick .
Sir , I hope you will not make so little of me ?
I make thee not so little as thou art : for indeed there goes nomore to the making of a Steward , but a fair Imprimis , and then areasonable Item infus 'd into him , and the thing is done .
Nay then you stir my duty , and I must tell you ?
What wouldst thou tell me , how Hopps grow , or hold some rottendiscourse of Sheep , or when our Lady-day falls ? Prethee farewel , andentertain my friends , be drunk and burn thy Table-books : and my dear sparkof velvet , thou and I .
Good Sir remember ?
I do remember thee a foolish fellow , one that did put histrust in Almanacks , and Horse-fairs , and rose by Hony and Pot-butter.Shall they come in yet ?
Nay then I must unfold your Brothers pleasure , these be the lessonsSir , he left behind him .
Prethee expound the first .
I leave to maintain my house three hundred pounds a year ; and myBrother to dispose of it .
Mark that my wicked Steward , and I dispose of it ?
Whilest he bears himself like a Gentleman , and my credit falls notin him. Mark that my good young Sir , mark that .
Nay , if it be no more I shall fulfil it , whilst my Legs willcarry me I'le bear my self Gentleman-like , but when I am drunk , let thembear me that can. Forward dear Steward .
Next it is my will , that he be furnished ( as my Brother ) withAttendance , Apparel , and the obedience of my people .
Steward this is as plain as your old Minikin-breeches. Yourwisdom will relent now , will it not ? Be mollified or -- you understand meSir , proceed ?
Next , that my Steward keep his place , and power , and bound myBrother 's wildness with his care .
I'le hear no more of this Apocrypha , bind it by it selfSteward .
This is your Brothers will , and as I take it , he makes no mentionof such company as you would draw unto you. Captains of Gallyfoists , suchas in a clear day have seen Callis , fellows that have no more of God , than their Oaths come to : they wear swords to reach fire at a Play , andget there the oyl 'd end of a Pipe , for their Guerdon : then the remnant ofyour Regiment , are wealthy Tobacco-Marchants , that set up with one Ounce , and break for three : together with a Forlorn hope of Poets , and all theselook like Carthusians , things without linnen : Are these fit company for myMasters Brother ?
I will either convert thee ( O thou Pagan Steward ) or presentlyconfound thee and thy reckonings , who 's there ? Call in the Gentlemen .
Good Sir .
Nay , you shall know both who I am , and where I am .
Are you my Masters Brother ?
Are you the sage Master Steward , with a face like an old
?
, Captain , Traveller , & c .
Then God help us all I say .
I , and 't is well said my old peer of France : welcomeGentlemen , welcome Gentlemen ; mine own dear Lads y'are richly welcome.Know this old Harry Groat .
Sir I will take your love .
Sir , you will take my Purse .
And study to continue it .
I do believe you .
Your honorable friend and Masters Brother , hath given you to usfor a worthy fellow , and so we hugg you Sir .
Has given himself into the hands of Varlets , not to be carv 'd out.Sir , are these the pieces ?
They are the Morals of the Age , the vertues , men made of gold .
Of your gold you mean Sir .
This is a man of War , and cryes go on , and wears his colours .
In 's nose .
In the fragrant field. This is a Traveller Sir , knows men andmanners , and has plow 'd up the Sea so far till both the Poles have knockt , has seen the Sun take Coach , and can distinguish the colour of his Horses , and their kinds , and had a Flanders-Mare leapt there .
'T is much .
I have seen more Sir .
'T is even enough o ' Conscience ; sit down , and rest you , you are atthe end of the world already. Would you had as good a Living Sir , as thisfellow could lie you out of , he has a notable gift i n't .
This ministers the smoak , and this the Muses .
And you the Cloaths , and Meat , and Money , you have a goodlygeneration of 'em , pray let them multiply , your Brother 's house is bigenough , and to say truth , h'as too much Land , hang it durt .
Why now thou art a loving stinkard. Fire off thy Annotationsand thy Rent-books , thou hast a weak brain Savil , and with the next longBill thou wilt run mad. Gentlemen , you are once more welcome to threehundred pounds a year ; we will be freely merry , shall we not ?
Merry as mirth and wine , my lovely Loveless .
A serious look shall be a Jury to excommunicate any man from ourcompany .
We will not talk wisely neither ?
What think you Gentlemen by all this Revenue in Drink ?
I am all for Drink .
I am dry till it be so .
He that will not cry Amen to this , let him live sober , seem wise , and dye o'th ' Coram .
It shall be so , we'l have it all in Drink , let Meat andLodging go , they are transitory , and shew men meerly mortal : then we'lhave Wenches , every one his Wench , and every week a fresh one : we'l keepno powdered flesh : all these we have by warrant , under the title of thingsnecessary. Here upon this place I ground it , The obedience of my people , and all necessaries : your opinions Gentlemen ?
'T is plain and evident that he meant Wenches .
Good Sir let me expound it ?
Here be as sound men , as your self Sir .
This do I hold to be the interpretation of it : In this wordNecessary , is concluded all that be helps to Man ; Woman was made thefirst , and therefore here the chiefest .
Believe me 't is a learned one ; and by these words , Theobedience of my people , you Steward being one , are bound to fetch usWenches .
He is , he is .
Steward , attend us for instructions .
But will you keep no house Sir ?
Nothing but drink Sir , three hundred pounds in drink .
O miserable house , and miserable I that live to see it ! Good Sirkeep some meat .
Get us good Whores , and for your part , I'le board you in anAlehouse , you shall have Cheese and Onions .
What shall become of me , no Chimney smoaking ? Well Prodigal , yourBrother will come home. [ Exit .
Come Lads , I'le warrant you for Wenches , three hundred poundsin drink. [ Exeunt omnes .
Scena Prima .
her Sister Martha , Welford , Younglove , and others .
Sir , now you see your bad lodging , I must bid you good night .
Lady if there be any want , 't is in want of you .
A little sleep will ease that complement. Once more good night .
Once more dear Lady , and then all sweet nights .
Dear Sir be short and sweet then .
Shall the morrow prove better to me , shall I hope my sute happierby this nights rest ?
Is your sute so sickly that rest will help it ? Pray ye let it restthen till I call for it. Sir as a stranger you have had all my welcome : but had I known your errand ere you came , your passage had been straiter.Sir , good night .
So fair , and cruel , dear unkind good night. [ Exit Lady.Nay Sir , you shall stay with me , I'le press your zeal so far .
O Lord Sir .
Do you love Tobacco ?
Surely I love it , but it loves not me ; yet with your reverence I'lebe bold .
Pray light it Sir. How do you like it ?
I promise you it is notable stinging geer indeed. It is wet Sir , Lord how it brings down Rheum !
Handle it again Sir , you have a warm text of it .
Thanks ever promised for it. I promise you it is very powerful , andby a Trope , spiritual ; for certainly it moves in sundry places .
I , it does so Sir , and me especially to ask Sir , why you wear aNight-cap .
Assuredly I will speak the truth unto you : you shall understandSir , that my head is broken , and by whom ; even by that visible beast theButler .
The Butler ? certainly he had all his drink about him when he didit. Strike one of your grave Cassock ? The offence Sir ?
Reproving him at Tra-trip Sir , for swearing ; you have the totalsurely .
You told him when his rage was set a tilt , and so he crackt yourCanons. I hope he has not hurt your gentle reading : But shall we see theseGentlewomen to night .
Have patience Sir until our fellow Nicholas be deceast , that is,
figure Sir .
Can not you cast another for the Gentlewomen ?
Not till the man be in his bed , his grave : his grave , his bed : thevery same again Sir. Our Comick Poet gives the reason sweetly ; Plenusrimarum est , he is full of loope-holes , and will discover to ourPatroness .
Your comment Sir has made me understand you .
Martha the Ladies Sister , and Younglove , to them with aPosset .
Sir be addrest , the graces do salute you with the full bowl ofplenty. Is our old enemy entomb 'd ?
He 's safe .
And does he snore out supinely with the Poet ?
No , he out-snores the Poet .
Gentlewoman , this courtesie shall bind a stranger to you , ever yourservant .
Sir , my Sisters strictness makes not us forget you are a strangerand a Gentleman .
In sooth Sir , were I chang 'd into my Lady , a Gentleman so wellindued with parts , should not be lost .
I thank you Gentlewoman , and rest bound to you. See how this foulfamiliar chewes the Cud : From thee , and three and fifty good Love deliverme .
Will you sit down Sir , and take a spoon ?
I take it kindly , Lady .
It is our best banquet Sir .
Shall we give thanks ?
I have to the Gentlewomen already Sir .
Good Sir Roger , keep that breath to cool your part o'th ' Posset , you may chance have a scalding zeal else ; and you will needs be doing , pray tell your twenty to your self. Would you could like this Sir ?
I would your Sister would like me as well Lady .
Sure Sir , she would not eat you : but banish that imagination ; she'sonly wedded to her self , lyes with her self , and loves her self ; and foranother Husband than herself , he may knock at the gate , but ne 're come in : be wise Sir , she 's a Woman , and a trouble , and has her many faults , theleast of which is , she can not love you .
God pardon her , she'l do worse , would I were worthy his leastgrief , Mistris Martha .
Now I must over-hear her .
Faith would thou hadst them all with all my heart ; I do not thinkthey would make thee a day older .
Sir , will you put in deeper , 't is the sweeter .
Well said old sayings .
She looks like one indeed. Gentlewoman you keep your word , yoursweet self has made the bottom sweeter .
Sir , I begin a frolick , dare you change Sir ?
My self for you , so please you. That smile has turn 'd my stomach : this is right the old Embleme of the Moyle cropping of Thistles : Lord whata hunting head she carries , sure she has been ridden with a Martingale.Now love deliver me .
Do I dream , or do I wake ? surely I know not : am I rub 'd off ? Isthis the way of all my morning Prayers ? Oh Roger , thou art but grass , and woman as a flower. Did I for this consume my quarters in Meditation , Vowes , and wooed her in Heroical Epistles ? Did I expound the Owl , andundertook with labour and expence the recollection of those thousandPieces , consum 'd in Cellars , and Tabacco-shops of that our honour 'd
? Have I done this , and am I done thus too ? I will endwith the wise man , and say ; He that holds a Woman , has an Eel by the tail .
Sir 't is so late , and our entertainment ( meaning our Posset ) bythis is grown so cold , that 'twere an unmannerly part longer to hold youfrom your rest : let what the house has be at your command Sir .
Sweet rest be with you Lady ; and to you what you desire too .
It should be some such good thing like your self then. [ Exeunt .
Heaven keep me from that curse , and all my issue. Good nightAntiquity .

Good Sir , peace be with you. [ Exit Roger .
Adue dear Domine. Half a dozen such in a Kingdom would make a manforswear confession : for who that had but half his wits about him , wouldcommit the Counsel of a serious sin to such a cruel Night-cap ? Why how nowshall we have an Antick ? [ Enter Servant.Whose head do you carry upon your shoulders , that you jole it so againstthe Post ? Is't for your ease ? Or have you seen the Celler ?

Yes Sir .
Have they any meat ?

You are merry Sir , and why so ?
Faith Sir , here are no Oats to be got , unless you'l have 'em in

Why ?
Why , they are transparent Sir , you may see through them : and such ahouse !
Come Sir , the truth of your discovery .
Sir , they are in tribes like Jewes : the Kitchin and the Dayrie makeone tribe , and have their faction and their fornication within themselves ; the Buttery and the Landry are another , and there 's no love lost ; thechambers are intire , and what 's done there , is somewhat higher than my
kept vertuous , that is , fasting. But of all this the drink Sir .
What of that Sir ?
Faith Sir , I will handle it as the time and your patience will giveme leave. This drink , or this cooling Julip , of which three spoonfulskills the Calenture , a pint breeds the cold Palsie .
Sir , you bely the house .
I would I did Sir. But as I am a true man , if 'twere but one degreecolder , nothing but an Asses hoof would hold it .
I am glad o n't Sir , for if it had proved stronger , you had beentongue ti 'd of these commendations. Light me the candle Sir , I'le hear nomore. [ Exeunt .

matter of moment ; you may meet with a worse back , I'le not commend it .
Nor I neither Sir .
Yet thus far by your favour Widow , 't is tuffe .
And therefore not for my dyet , for I love a tender one .
Sweet Widow leave your frumps , and be edified : you know my state , Isell no Perspectives , Scarfs , Gloves , nor Hangers , nor put my trust inShoe-ties ; and where your Husband in an age was rising by burnt figs , dreg 'd with meal and powdered sugar , saunders , and grains , wormeseed androtten Raisins , and such vile Tobacco , that made the footmen mangie ; I ina year have put up hundreds inclos 'd , my Widow , those pleasant Meadows , bya forfeit morgage : for which the poor Knight takes a lone chamber , owesfor his Ale , and dare not beat his Hostess : nay more --
Good Sir no more , what ere my Husband was , I know what I am , and ifyou marry me , you must bear it bravely off Sir .
Not with the head , sweet Widow .
No sweet Sir , but with your shoulders : I must have you dub 'd , forunder that I will not stoop a feather. My husband was a fellow lov 'd totoyle , fed ill , made gain his exercise , and so grew costive , which forthat I was his wife , I gave way to , and spun mine own smocks course , andsir , so little : but let that pass , time , that wears all things out , woreout this husband , who in penitence of such fruitless five years marriage , left me great with his wealth , which if you'le be a worthie gossip to , beknighted Sir.

Will you sell Sir ?
No not out right good Gripe ; marry , a morgage or such a slightsecuritie .
I have no mony , Sir , for Morgage ; if you will sell , and all ornone , I'le work a new Mine for you .

If you'l tun up theStraights you may , for you have no calling for drink there , but with aCanon , nor no scoring but on your Ships sides , and then if you scape withlife , and take a Faggot boat and a bottle of Usquebaugh , come home poormen , like a tipe of Thames-street stinking of Pitch and Poor-John. Icannot tell Sir , I would be loth to see it .

This is the strangest pampered piece of flesh towards fifty , thatever frailty copt withal , what a trim lennoy here she has put upon me ; these women are a proud kind of Cattel , and love this whorson doing sodirectly , that they will not stick to make their very skins Bawdes totheir flesh. Here 's Dogskin and Storax sufficient to kill a Hawk : what todo with it , besides nailing it up amongst Irish heads of Teere , to shewthe mightiness of her Palm , I know not : there she is. I must enter intoDialogue. Lady you have lost your Glove .
Not Sir , if you have found it .
It was my meaning Lady to restore it .
'Twill be uncivil in me to take back a favour , Fortune hath sowell bestowed Sir , pray wear it for me .
I had rather wear a Bell. But hark you Mistres , what hidden vertueis there in this Glove , that you would have me wear it ? Is't good againstsore eyes , or will it charm the Toothach ? Or these red tops ; being steeptin white wine soluble , wil't kill the Itch ? Or has it so conceal 'd aprovidence to keep my hand from Bonds ? If it have none of these and proveno more but a bare Glove of half a Crown a pair , 'twill be but half acourtesie , I wear two alwayes , faith let 's draw cuts , one will do me nopleasure .
The tenderness of his years keeps him as yet in ignorance , he 's awell moulded fellow , and I wonder his bloud should stir no higher ; but'tis his want of company : I must grow nearer to him .

Why through the doors , they are open .
What are you ? And what business have you here ?
More I believe than you have .
Who would this fellow speak with ? Art thou sober ?
Yes , I come not here to sleep .
Prethee what art thou ?
As much ( gay man ) as thou art , I am a Gentleman .
Art thou no more ?
Yes more than thou dar'st be ; a Souldier .
Thou dost not come to quarrel ?
No , not with women ; I come to speak here with a Gentlewoman .

Why am not I good enough for you Sir ?
Your way you'l be too good , pray end my business. This isanother Sutor , O frail Woman !
This fellow with his bluntness hopes to do more than the long sutesof a thousand could ; though he be sowre he 's quick , I must not trust him.Sir , this Lady is not to speak with you , she is more serious : you smell asif you were new calkt ; go and be hansome , and then you may sit with herServingmen .
What are you Sir ?
Guess by my outside .
Then I take you Sir , for some new silken thing wean 'd from theCountry , that shall ( when you come to keep good company ) be beaten intobetter manners. Pray good proud Gentlewoman , help me to your Mistress .
How many lives hast thou , that thou talk'st thus rudely ?
But one , one , I am neither Cat nor Woman .
And will that one life , Sir , maintain you ever in such boldsawciness ?
Yes , amongst a Nation of such men as you are , and be no worsefor wearing , shall I speak with this Lady ?
No by my troth shall you not .
I must stay here then ?
That you shall not neither .
Good fine thing tell me why ?
Good angry thing I'le tell you : This is no place for such companions , Such lousie Gentlemen shall find their businessBetter i'th ' Suburbs , there your strong pitch perfume , Mingled with lees of Ale , shall reek in fashion : This is no Thames-street , Sir .
This Gentleman informs you truly : Prethee be satisfied , and seek the Suburbs , Good Captain , or what ever title else , The Warlike Eele-boats have bestowed upon thee , Go and reform thy self , prethee be sweeter , And know my Lady speaks with no Swabbers .
You can not talk me out with your traditionOf wit you pick from Plays , go to , I have found ye : And for you , Sir , whose tender gentle bloodRuns in your Nose , and makes you snuff at all , But three pil 'd people , I do let you know , He that begot your worships Sattin-sute , Can make no men Sir : I will see this Lady , And with the reverence of your silkenship , In these old Ornaments .
You will not sure ?
Sure Sir I shall .
You would be beaten out ?
Indeed I would not , or if I would be beaten , Pray who shall beat me ? this good GentlemanLooks as if he were o'th ' peace .

This uncivil fellow ; He saies he comes from Sea , where I believe , H'as purg 'd away his manners .
Why what of him ?
Why he will rudely without once God bless you , Press to your privacies , and no denialMust stand betwixt your person and his business ; I let go his ill Language .
Sir , have you business with me ?
Madam some I have , But not so serious to pawn my life for't : If you keep this quarter , and maintain about youSuch Knights o'th ' Sun as this is , to defieMen of imployment to ye , you may live , But in what fame ?
Pray stay Sir , who has wrong 'd you ?
Wrong me he can not , though uncivillyHe flung his wild words at me : but to youI think he did no honour , to denyThe hast I come withal , a passage to you , Though I seem course .
Excuse me gentle Sir , 't was from my knowledge , And shall have no protection. And to you Sir , You have shew 'd more heat than wit , and from your selfHave borrowed power , I never gave you here , To do these vile unmanly things : my houseIs no blind street to swagger in ; and my favoursNot doting yet on your unknown desertsSo far , that I should make you Master of my business ; My credit yet stands fairer with the peopleThan to be tried with swords ; and they that comeTo do me service , must not think to win meWith hazard of a murther ; if your loveConsist in fury , carry it to the Camp : And there in honour of some common Mistress , Shorten your youth , I pray be better temper 'd : And give me leave a while Sir .
You must have it. [ Exit Welford .
Now Sir , your business ?
First , I thank you for schooling this young fellow , Whom his own follies , which he 's prone enoughDaily to fall into , if you but frown , Shall level him a way to his repentance : Next , I should rail at you , but you are a Woman , And anger 's lost upon you .
Why at me Sir ? I never did you wrong , for to my knowledgeThis is the first sight of you .
You have done that , I must confess I have the least curse inBecause the least acquaintance : But there be ( If there be honour in the minds of men ) Thousands when they shall know what I deliver , ( As all good men must share i n't ) will to shameBlast your black memory .
How is this good Sir ?
'T is that , that if you have a soul will choak it : Y'ave kill 'd a Gentleman .
I kill 'd a Gentleman !
You and your cruelty have kill 'd him Woman , And such a man ( let me be angry i n't ) Whose least worth weighed above all womens vertuesThat are ; I spare you all to come too : guess him now ?
I am so innocent I can not Sir .
Repent you mean , you are a perfect Woman , And as the first was , made for mans undoing .
Sir , you have mist your way , I am not she .
Would he had mist his way too , though he hadWandered farther than Women are ill spoken of , So he had mist this misery , you Lady .
How do you do , Sir ?
Well enough I hope.While I can keep my self out from temptations .
Leap into this matter , whither would ye ?
You had a Servant that your peevishnessInjoined to Travel .
Such a one I haveStill , and shall be griev 'd 'twere otherwise .
Then have your asking , and be griev 'd he 's dead ; How you will answer for his worth , I know not , But this I am sure , either he , or you , or bothWere stark mad , else he might have liv'dTo have given a stronger testimony to th ' worldOf what he might have been. He was a manI knew but in his evening , ten Suns after , Forc 'd by a Tyrant storm our beaten BarkBulg 'd under us ; in which sad parting blow , He call 'd upon his Saint , but not for life , On you unhappy Woman , and whilest allSought to preserve their Souls , he desperatelyImbrac 'd a Wave , crying to all that saw it , If any live , go to my Fate that forc 'd meTo this untimely end , and make her happy : His name was Loveless : And I scap't the storm , And now you have my business .
'T is too much.Would I had been that storm , he had not perisht.If you'l rail now I will forgive you Sir.Or if you'l call in more , if any moreCome from this ruine , I shall justly sufferWhat they can say , I do confess my selfA guiltie cause in this. I would say more , But grief is grown too great to be delivered .
I like this well : these women are strange things.'Tis somewhat of the latest now to weep , You should have wept when he was going from you , And chain 'd him with those tears at home .
Would you had told me then so , these two arms had been his Sea .
Trust me you move me much : but say he lived , these wereforgotten things again .
I , say you so ? Sure I should know that voice : this is knavery.I'le fit you for it. Were he living Sir , I would perswade you to becharitable , I , and confess we are not all so ill as your opinion holds us.O my friend , what penance shall I pull upon my fault , upon my mostunworthy self for this ?
Leave to love others , 't was some jealousieThat turn 'd him desperate .
I'le be with you straight : are you wrung there ?
This works amain upon her .
I do confess there is a GentlemanHas born me long good will .
I do not like that .
And vow 'd a thousand services to me ; to me , regardless of him : Butsince Fate , that no power can withstand , has taken from me my first , andbest love , and to weep away my youth is a mere folly , I will shew you whatI determine sir : you shall know all : Call M. Welford there : ThatGentleman I mean to make the model of my Fortunes , and in his chastimbraces keep alive the memory of my lost lovely Loveless : he issomewhat like him too .
Then you can love .
Yes certainly Sir ? Though it please you to think me hard and cruel , I hope I shall perswade you otherwise .
I have made my self a fine fool .
Welford .
Would you have spoke with me Madam ?
Yes M. Welford , and I ask your pardon before this Gentleman forbeing froward : this kiss , and henceforth more affection .
So , 't is better I were drown 'd indeed .
This is a sudden passion , God hold it.This fellow out of his fear sure hasPerswaded her. I'le give him a new suit o n't .
A parting kiss , and good Sir , let me pray youTo wait me in the Gallerie .
I am in another world , Madam where you please. [ Exit Welford .
I will to Sea , and 't shall goe hard but I'le be drown'dindeed .
Now Sir you see I am no such hard creature , But time may win me .
You have forgot your lost Love .
Alas Sir , what would you have me do ? I can not call him back againwith sorrow ; I'le love this man as dearly , and beshrow me I'le keep himfar enough from Sea , and 't was told me , now I remember me , by an old wisewoman , that my first Love should be drown 'd , and see 't is come about .
I would she had told you your second should be hang 'd too , andlet that come about : but this is very strange .
Faith Sir , consider all , and then I know you'le be of my mind : ifweeping would redeem him , I would weep still .
But say that I were Loveless , And scap 'd the storm , how would you answer this ?
Why for that Gentleman I would leave all the world .
This young thing too ?
That young thing too , Or any young thing else : why , I would lose my state .
Why then he lives still , I am he , your Loveless .
Alas I knew it Sir , and for that purpose prepared this Pageant : get you to your task. And leave these Players tricks , or I shall leaveyou , indeed I shall. Travel , or know me not .
Will you then marry ?
I will not promise , take your choice. Farewell .
There is no other Purgatorie but a Woman.I must doe something. [ Exit Loveless .
Welford .
Mistress I am bold .
You are indeed .
You so overjoyed me Lady .
Take heed you surfeit not , pray fast and welcom .
By this light you love me extreamly .
By this , and to morrows light , I care not for you .
Come , come , you can not hide it .
Indeed I can , where you shall never find it .
I like this mirth well Lady .
You shall have more o n't .
I must kiss you .
No Sir .
Indeed I must .
What must be , must be ; I'le take my leave , you have your parting
hither , and tell them when you travel next , 'twere fit you brought lessbravery with you , and more wit , you'le never get a wife else .
Are you in earnest ?
Yes faith. Will you eat Sir , your horses will be readie straight , you shall have a napkin laid in the butterie for ye .
Do not you love me then ?
Yes , for that face .
It is a good one Ladie .
Yes , if it were not warpt , the fire in time may mend it .
Me thinks yours is none of the best Ladie .
No by my troth Sir ; yet o ' my conscience , You would make shiftwith it .
Come pray no more of this .
I will not : Fare you well. Ho , who 's within there ? bring out theGentlemans horses , he 's in haste ; and set some cold meat on the Table .
I have too much of that I thank you Ladie : take your Chamber whenyou please , there goes a black one with you Ladie .
Farewell young man. [ Exit Ladie .
You have made me one , Farewell : and may the curse of a great housefall upon thee , I mean the Butler. The devil and all his works are inthese women , would all of my sex were of my mind , I would make 'em a newLent , and a long one , that flesh might be in more reverence with them .
I am sorry M. Welford .
So am I , that you are here .
How does my Ladie use you ?
As I would use you , scurvilie .
I should have been more kind Sir .
I should have been undone then. Pray leave me , and look to yoursweet-meats ; hark , your Ladie calls .
Sir , I shall borrow so much time without offence .
Y'are nothing but offence , for Gods love leave me .
'T is strange my Ladie should be such a tyrant ?
To send you to me , 'Pray goe stitch , good doe , y'are more troubleto me than a Term .
I do not know how my good will , if I said love I lied not , shouldany way deserve this ?
A thousand waies , a thousand waies ; sweet creature let me depart inpeace .
What Creature Sir ? I hope I am a woman .
A hundred I think by your noise .
Since you are angrie Sir , I am bold to tell you that I am a woman , and a rib .
Of a roasted horse .
Conster me that ?
A Dog can doe it better ; Farwell Countess , and commend me to yourLadie , tell her she 's proud , and scurvie , and so I commit you both to yourtempter .
Sweet Mr. Welford .
Avoid old Satanus : Go daub your ruines , your face looks fouler thana storm : the Foot-man stayes for you in the Lobby Lady .

Young Loveless , and Comrades , Morecraft , Widow , Savil , and therest .
Save thy brave shoulder , my young puissant Knight , and may thyback Sword bite them to the bone that love thee not , thou art an errantman , go on. The circumcis 'd shall fall by thee. Let Land and labour fillthe man that tills , thy sword must be thy plough , and Jove it speed .
shall sweat , and Mahomet shall fall , and thy dear name fill uphis monument .
It shall Captain , I mean to be a Worthy .
One Worthy is too little , thou shalt be all .
Captain I shall deserve some of your love too .
Thou shalt have heart and hand too , noble Morecraft , if themwilt lend me mony. I am a man of Garrison , be rul 'd , and open to me thoseinfernal gates , whence none of thy evil Angels pass again , and I willstile thee noble , nay Don Diego. I'le woo thy Infanta for thee , and myKnight shall feast her with high meats , and make her apt .
Pardon me Captain , y'are beside my meaning .
No Mr. Morecraft , 't is the Captains meaning I should prepareher for ye .
Or provok her. Speak my modern man , I say provoke her .
Captain , I say so too , or stir her to it. So say the Criticks .
But howsoever you expound it sir , she 's very welcom , and thisshall serve for witness. And Widow , since y'are come so happily , you shalldeliver up the keyes , and free possession of this house , whilst I stand byto ratifie .
I had rather give it back again believe me , 'T is a miserie to sayyou had it. Take heed ?
'T is past that Widow , come , sit down , some wine there , thereis a scurvie banquet if we had it. All this fair house is yours Sir
?
Yes Sir .
Are your keyes readie , I must ease your burden .
I am readie Sir to be undone , when you shall call me to't .
Come come , thou shalt live better .
I shall have less to doe , that 's all , there 's half a dozen of myfriends i'th ' fields sunning against a bank , with half a breech among 'em , I shall be with 'em shortly. The care and continuall vexation of beingrich , eat up this rascall. What shall become of my poor familie , they areno sheep , and they must keep themselves .
Drink Master Morecraft , pray be merrie all : Nay and you will not drink there 's no societie , Captain speak loud , and drink : widow , a word .
Expou [ n ] d her throughly Knight. Here God o ' gold , here 's to thyfair possessions ; Be a Baron and a bold one : leave off your tickling ofyoung heirs like Trouts , and let thy Chimnies smoke. Feed men of war , liveand be honest , and be saved yet .
I thank you worthie Captain for your counsel. You keep yourChimnies smoking there , your nostrils , and when you can , you feed a man ofWar , this makes you not a Baron , but a bare one : and how or when you shallbe saved , let the Clark o'th ' companie ( you have commanded ) have a justcare of .
The man is much moved. Be not angrie Sir , but as the Poet sings , let your displeasure be a short furie , and goe out. You have spoke home , and bitterly , to me Sir. Captain take truce , the Miser is a tart and awittie whorson --
Poet , you feign perdie , the wit of this man lies in his fingersends , he must tell all ; his tongue fills his mouth like a neats tongue , and only serves to lick his hungrie chaps after a purchase : his brains andbrimstone are the devils diet to a fat usurers head : To her Knight , to
Here 's your poor friend , and Savil Sir .
Away , th'art rich in ornaments of nature. First in thy face , thouhast a serious face , a betting , bargaining , and saving face , a rich face , pawn it to the Usurer ; a face to kindle the compassion of the mostignorant and frozen Justice .
'T is such I dare not shew it shortly sir .
Be blithe and bonny steward : Master Morecraft , Drink to this manof reckoning ?
Here 's e'ne to him .
The Devil guide it downward : would there were i n't an acre of thegreat broom field he bought , to sweep your durtie Conscience , or to choakye , 't is all one to me , Usurer .
Consider what I told you , you are young , unapt for worldly
things of care , should stir and break her better meditations , in the barebrokage of a brace of Angels ? or a new Kirtel , though it be Satten ? eat bythe hope of surfeits , and lie down only in expectation of a morrow , thatmay undo some easie hearted fool , or reach a widows curses ? Let out mony , whose use returns the principal ? and get out of these troubles , aconsuming heir : For such a one must follow necessarily , you shall diehated , if not old and miserable ; and that possest wealth that you got withpining , live to see tumbled to anothers hands , that is no more a kin toyou , than you to his couzenage .
Sir you speak well , would God that charity had first begun here .
'T is yet time. Be merrie , me thinks you want wine there , there 's more i'th ' house. Captain , where rests the health ?
It shall goe round boy .
Say you can suffer this , because the end points at muchprofit , can you so far bow below your blood , below your too much beautie , to be a partner of this fellowes bed , and lie with his diseases ? if youcan , I will no [ t ] press you further : yet look upon him : there 's nothing inthat hide-bound Usurer , that man of mat , that all decai 'd , but aches , foryou to love , unless his perisht lungs , his drie cough , or his scurvie.This is truth , and so far I dare speak yet : he has yet past cure ofPhysick , spaw , or any diet , a primitive pox in his bones ; and o ' myKnowledge he has been ten times rowell 'd : ye may love him ; he had abastard , his own toward issue , whipt , and then cropt for washing out theroses , in three farthings to make 'em pence .
I do not like these Morals .
You must not like him then .

I am glad to hear it Brother , pray God you are wise too .
Pray Mr. Morecraft know my elder Brother , and Captain do youcomplement. Savil I dare swear is glad at heart to see you ; Lord , weheard Sir you were drown 'd at Sea , and see how luckily things come about !
This mony must be paid again Sir .
No Sir , pray keep the Sale , 'twill make good Tailors measures ; I am well I thank you .
By my troth the Gentleman has stew 'd him in his own Sawce , I shalllove him for't .
I know not where I am , I am so glad : your worship is the welcom'stman alive ; upon my knees I bid you welcome home : here has been such ahurry , such a din , such dismal Drinking , Swearing and Whoring , 'thasalmost made me mad : we have all liv 'd in a continual Turnbal-street ; Sir , blest be Heaven , that sent you safe again , now shall I eat and go tobed again .

Better and better still .
What is this fellow , Brother ?
The thirsty Usurer that supt my Land off .
What does he tarry for ?
Sir to be Landlord of your House and State : I was bold to makea little sale Sir .
Am I overreach 'd ? if there be Law I'le hamper ye .
Prethee be gone , and rave at home , thou art so base a fool Icannot laugh at thee : Sirrah , this comes of couzening , home and spare , eatReddish till you raise your sums again. If you stir far in this , I'le haveyou whipt , your ears nail 'd for intelligencing o'the Pillory , and yourgoods forfeit : you are a stale couzener , leave my house : no more .
A pox upon your house. Come Widow , I shall yet hamper this youngGamester .
Good twelve i'th ' hundred keep your way , I am not for your diet , marry in your own Tribe Jew , and get a Broker .
'T is well said Widow : will you jog on Sir ?
Yes , I will go , but 't is no matter whither : But when I trust a wild Fool , and a Woman , May I lend Gratis , and build Hospitals .
Nay good Sir , make all even , here 's a Widow wants your goodword for me , she 's rich , and may renew me and my fortunes .
I am glad you look before you. Gentlewoman , here is a poordistressed younger Brother .
You do him wrong Sir , he 's a Knight .
I ask you mercy : yet 't is no matter , his Knighthood is noinheritance I take it : whatsoever he is , he is your Servant , or would be , Lady. Faith be not merciless , but make a man ; he 's young and handsome , though he be my Brother , and his observances may deserve your Love : heshall not fail for means .
Sir you speak like a worthy Brother : and so much I do credit yourfair Language , that I shall love your Brother : and so love him , but Ishall blush to say more .
Stop her mouth. I hope you shall not live to know that hourwhen this shall be repented. Now Brother I should chide , but I'le give nodistaste to your fair Mistress. I will instruct her i n't and she shalldo't : you have been wild and ignorant , pray mend it .

Good Sir forgive me , and but hear me speak ?
Me thinks thou shouldst be drunk still , and not speak , 'tisthe more pardonable .
I will Sir , if you will have it so .
I thank ye : yes , e'ne pursue it Sir : do you hear ? get a Whoresoon for your recreation : go look out Captain Broken-breech your fellow , and Quarrel if you dare : I shall deliver these Keys to one shall have morehonesty , though not so much fine wit Sir. You may walk and gather

Alas poor Gentlewoman , to what a misery hath Age brought thee : to what a scurvy Fortune ! Thou that hast been a Companion for Noblemen , and at the worst of those times for Gentlemen : now like a brokenServingman , must beg for favour to those , that would have crawl 'd likePilgrims to my Chamber but for an Apparition of me. You that be coming on , make much of fifteen , and so till five and twenty : use your time withreverence , that your profits may arise : it will not tarry with you , Ecce
plague of his iron teeth , and draw 'em for't , has been a little bolderhere than welcome : and now to say the truth , I am fit for no man.

My littleLevite hath forsaken me , his silver sound of Cittern quite abolish [ t ] , [ h ] is doleful hymns under my Chamber window , digested into tedious

To this good Homilist I have been everstubborn , which God forgive me for , and mend my manners : and Love , if everthou hadst care of forty , of such a piece of lape ground , hear my prayer , and fire his zeal so far forth that my faults in this renued impression ofmy love may shew corrected to our gentle reader .
Roger.See how negligently he passes by me : with what an Equipage Canonical , asthough he had broken the heart of Bellarmine , or added something to thesinging Brethren. 'T is scorn , I know it , and deserve it , Mr. Roger .
Fair Gentlewoman , my name is Roger .
Then gentle Roger ?
Ungentle Abigal .
Why M'r Roger will you set your wit to a weak womans ?
You are weak indeed : for so the Poet sings .
I do confess my weakness , sweet Sir Roger .
Good my Ladies Gentlewoman , or my good Ladies Gentlewoman ( thistrope is lost to you now ) leave your prating , you have a season of yourfirst mother in ye : and surely had the Devil been in love , he had beenabused too : go Dalilah , you make men fools , and wear Fig-breeches .
Well , well , hard hearted man ; dilate upon the weak infirmities of
seen those eyes , those eyes , those orient eyes .
I they were pearls once with you .
Saving your reverence Sir , so they are still .
Nay , nay , I do beseech you leave your cogging , what they are , theyare , they serve me without Spectacles I thank 'em .
O will you kill me ?
I do not think I can , Y'are like a Copy-hold with nine lives i n't .
You were wont to bear a Christian fear about you : For your own worships sake .
I was a Christian fool then : Do you remember what a dance you ledme ? how I grew qualm 'd in love , and was a dunce ? could expound but once aquarter , and then was out too : and then out of the stinking stir you putme in , I prayed for my own issue. You do remember all this ?
O be as then you were !
I thank you for it , surely I will be wiser Abigal : and as theEthnick Poet sings , I will not lose my oyl and labour too. Y'are for theworshipfull I take it Abigal .
O take it so , and then I am for thee !
I like these tears well , and this humbling also , they are Symptomesof contrition. If I should fall into my fit again , would you not shake meinto a quotidian Coxcombe ? Would you not use me scurvily again , and giveme possets with purging Confets i n't ? I tell thee Gentlewoman , thou hastbeen harder to me , than a long pedigree .
O Curate cure me : I will love thee better , dearer , longer : I willdo any thing , betray the secrets of the main house-hold to thyreformation. My Ladie shall look lovingly on thy learning , and when truetime shall point thee for a Parson , I will convert thy egges to pennycustards , and thy tith goose shall graze and multiply .
I am mollified , as well shall testifie this faithfull kiss , andhave a great care Mistris Abigal how you depress the Spirit any morewith your rebukes and mocks : for certainly the edge of such a follie cutsit self .
O Sir , you have pierc 'd me thorow. Here I vow a recantation tothose malicious faults I ever did against you. Never more will I despiseyour learning , never more pin cards and cony tails upon your Cassock , never again reproach your reverend nightcap , and call it by the mangiename of murrin , never your reverend person more , and say , you look likeone of Baals Priests in a hanging , never again when you say grace laughat you , nor put you out at prayers : never cramp you more , nor when youride , get Sope and Thistles for you. No my Roger , these faults shall becorrected and amended , as by the tenour of my tears appears .
Now can not I hold if I should be hang 'd , I must crie too. Come tothine own beloved , and do even what thou wilt with me sweet , sweet
I am thine own for ever : here 's my hand , when Roger proves arecreant , hang him i'th ' Bel-ropes .

Ha , ha , ha .
What ails the fellow ?
The fellow comes to laugh at you , I tell you Ladie I would notfor your Land , be such a Coxcomb , such a whining Ass , as you decreed mefor when I was last here .
I joy to hear you are wise , 't is a rare JewelIn an Elder Brother : pray be wiser yet .
Me thinks I am very wise : I do not come a wooing. Indeed I'lemove no more love to your Ladiship .
What makes you here then ?
Only to see you and be merry Ladie : that 's all my business.Faith let 's be very merry. Where 's little Roger ? he 's a good fellow : anhour or two well spent in wholesome mirth , is worth a thousand of thesepuling passions. 'T is an ill world for Lovers .
They were never fewer .
I thank God there 's one less for me Ladie .
You were never any Sir .
Till now , and now I am the prettiest fellow .
You talk like a Tailor Sir .
Me thinks your faces are no such fine things now .
Why did you tell me you were wise ? Lord what a lying age is this , where will you mend these faces ?
A Hogs face soust is worth a hundred of 'em .
Sure you had a Sow to your Mother .
She brought such fine white Pigs as you , fit for none butParsons Ladie .
'T is well you will allow us our Clergie yet .
That shall not save you. O that I were in love again with awish .
By this light you are a scurvie fellow , pray be gone .
You know I am a clean skin 'd man .
Do I know it ?
Come , come , you would know it ; that 's as good : but not a snap , never long for't , not a snap dear Ladie .
Hark ye Sir , hark ye , get ye to the Suburbs , there 's horse fleshfor such hounds : will you goe Sir ?
Lord how I lov 'd this woman , how I worshipt this prettie calfwith the white face here : as I live , you were the prettiest fool to playwithall , the wittiest little varlet , it would talk : Lord how it talk't ! and when I angred it , it would cry out , and scratch , and eat no meat , andit would say , goe hang .
It will say so still , if you anger it .
And when I askt it , if it would be married , it sent me of anerrand into France , and would abuse me , and be glad it did so .
Sir this is most unmanly , pray by gon .
And swear ( even when it twitter 'd to be at me ) I wasunhansome .
Have you no manners in you ?
And say my back was melted , when God he knows , I kept it at a
You think all this is true now ?
Faith whether it be or no , 't is too good for you. But so muchfor our mirth : Now have at you in earnest .
There is enough Sir , I desire no more .
Yes faith , wee'l have a cast at your best parts now. And thenthe Devil take the worst .
Pray Sir no more , I am not so much affected with yourcommendations , 't is almost dinner , I know they stay for you at theOrdinary .
E'ne a short Grace , and then I am gone ; You are a woman , andthe proudest that ever lov 'd a Coach : the scornfullest , scurviest , andmost senceless woman ; the greediest to be prais 'd , and never mov 'd thoughit be gross and open ; the most envious , that at the poor fame of anothersface , would eat your own , and more than is your own , the paint belongingto it : of such a self opinion , that you think none can deserve your glove : and for your malice , you are so excellent , you might have been yourTempters tutor : nay , never cry .
Your own heart knows you wrong me : I cry for ye ?
You shall before I leave you .
Is all this spoke in earnest ?
Yes and more as soon as I can get it out .
Well out with't .
You are , let me see .
One that has us 'd you with too much respect .
One that hath us 'd me ( since you will have it so ) the basest , the most Foot-boy-like , without respect of what I was , or what you mightbe by me ; you have us 'd me , as I would use a jade , ride him off 's legs , then turn him to the Commons ; you have us 'd me with discretion , and Ithank ye. If you have many more such pretty Servants , pray build anHospital , and when they are old , pray keep 'em for shame .
I can not think yet this is serious .
Will you have more o n't ?
No faith , there 's enough if it be true : Too much by all my part ; you are no Lover then ?
No , I had rather be a Carrier .
Why the Gods amend all .
Neither do I think there can be such a fellow found i'th'world , to be in love with such a froward woman , if there be such , they'remad , Jove comfort 'em. Now you have all , and I as new a man , as light , and spirited , that I feel my self clean through another creature. O 'tisbrave to be ones own man , I can see you now as I would see a Picture , sitall day by you and never kiss your hand : hear you sing , and never fall
thank you. I can now keep my mony in my purse , that still was gadding outfor Scarfes and Wastcoats : and keep my hand from Mercers sheep-skinsfinely. I can eat mutton now , and feast my self with my two shillings , andcan see a play for eighteen pence again : I can my Ladie .
The carriage of this fellow vexes me. Sir , pray let me speak alittle private with you , I must not suffer this .
Ha , ha , ha , what would you with me ? You will not ravish me ? Now , your set speech ?
Thou perjur 'd man .
Ha , ha , ha , this is a fine exordium.And why I pray you perjur 'd ?
Did you not swear a thousand thousand times you lov 'd me best ofall things ?
I do confess it : make your best of that .
Why do you say you do not then ?
Nay I'le swear it , And give sufficient reason , your own usage .
Do you not love me then ?
No faith .
Did you ever think I lov 'd you dearly ?
Yes , but I see but rotten fruits o n't .
Do not denie your hand for I must kiss it , and take my lastfarewell , now let me die so you be happy .
I am too foolish : Ladie speak dear Ladie .
No let me die. She swounds .
Oh my Sister !
O my Ladie help , help .
Run for some Rosalis !
I have plaid the fine ass : bend her bodie , Lady , best , dearest , worthiest Lady , hear your Servant , I am not as I shew 'd : Owretched fool , to fling away the Jewel of thy life thus. Give her moreair , see she begins to stir , sweet Mistress hear me !
Is my Servant well ?
In being yours I am so .
Then I care not .
How do ye , reach a chair there ; I confess my fault notpardonable , in pursuing thus upon such tenderness my wilfull error ; buthad I known it would have wrought thus with ye , thus strangely , not theworld had won me to it , and let not ( my best Ladie ) any word spoke to myend disturb your quiet peace : for sooner shall you know a general ruine , than my faith broken. Do not doubt this Mistris , for by my life I cannotlive without you. Come , come , you shall not grieve , rather be angrie , andheap infliction upon me : I will suffer. O I could curse my self , praysmile upon me. Upon my faith it was but a trick to trie you , knowing youlov 'd me dearlie , and yet strangely that you would never shew it , thoughmy means was all humilitie .
Ha , ha .
How now ?
I thank you fine fool for your most fine plot ; this was a subtileone , a stiff device to have caught Dottrels with. Good senceless Sir , could you imagine I should swound for you , and know your self to be anarrant ass ? I , a discovered one. 'T is quit I thank you Sir. Ha , ha , ha .
Take heed Sir , she may chance to swound again .
Ha , ha , ha .
Step to her Sir , see how she changes colour .
I'le goe to hell first , and be better welcom.I am fool 'd , I do confess it , finely fool 'd , Ladie , fool 'd Madam , and I thank you for it .
Faith 't is not so much worth Sir : But if I knew when you come next a burding , I'le have a stronger noose to hold the Woodcock .
Ha , ha , ha .
I am glad to see you merry , pray laugh on .
H'ad a hard heart that could not laugh at you Sir , ha , ha , ha .
Pray Sister do not laugh , you'le anger him , And then hee'l rail like a rude Costermonger , That School-boys had couzened of his Apples , As loud and senceless .
I will not rail .
Faith then let 's hear him Sister .
Yes , you shall hear me .
Shall we be the better by it then ?
No , he that makes a woman better by his words , I'le have him Sainted : blows will not doe it .
By this light hee 'll beat us .
You do deserve it richly , And may live to have a Beadle doe it .
Now he rails .
Come scornfull Folly , If this be railing , you shall hear me rail .
Pray put it in good words then .
The worst are good enough for such a trifle , Such a proud piece of Cobweblawn .
You bite Sir ?
I would till the bones crackt , and I had my will .
We had best muzzel him , he grows mad .
I would 'twere lawfull in the next great sickness to have theDogs spared , those harmless creatures , and knock i'th ' head these hotcontinual plagues , women , that are more infectious. I hope the State willthink o n't .
Are you well Sir ?
He looks as though he had a grievous fit o'th ' Colick .
Green-ginger will cure me .
I'le heat a trencher for him .
Durty December doe , Thou with a face as old as Erra Pater , such a Prognosticating nose : thou thing that ten years since has left tobe a woman , outworn the expectation of a Baud ; and thy dry bones can reachat nothing now , but gords or ninepins , pray goe fetch a trencher goe .
Let him alone , he 's crack't .
I'le see him hang 'd first , is a beastly fellow to use a woman ofmy breeding thus ; I marry is he : would I were a man , I'de make him eat hisKnaves words !
Tie your she Otter up , good Lady folly , she stinks worse thana Bear-baiting .
Why will you be angry now ?
Goe paint and purge , call in your kennel with you : you a Lady ?
Sirra , look to't against the quarter Sessions , if there be goodbehaviour in the world , I'le have thee bound to it .
You must not seek it in your Ladies house then ; pray send thisFerret home , and spin good Abigal. And Madam , that your Ladiship mayknow , in what base manner you have us 'd my service , I do from this hourhate thee heartily ; and though your folly should whip you to repentance , and waken you at length to see my wrongs , 't is not the endeavour of yourlife shall win me ; not all the friends you have , intercession , nor yoursubmissive letters , though they spoke as many tears as words ; not yourknees grown to th ' ground in penitence , nor all your state , to kiss you ; nor my pardon , nor will to give you Christian burial , if you dye thus ; sofarewell. When I am married and made sure , I'le come and visit you again , and vex you Ladie. By all my hopes I'le be a torment to you , worse than atedious winter. I know you will recant and sue to me , but save that
youth to drink and sacerdote upon quarrels , or take a drawn whore from anHospital , that time , diseases , and Mercury had eaten , than to be drawnto love you .
Ha , ha , ha , pray do , but take heed though .

I would be loth to anger him too much ; what fine foolery is thisin a woman , to use those men most forwardly they love most ? If I shouldlose him thus , I were rightly served. I hope he 's not so much himself , totake it to th'heart : how now ? will he come back ?
Abigal .
Never , he swears , whilst he can hear men say there 's any woman
Didst thou intreat him wench ?
As well as I could Madam. But this is still your way , to lovebeing absent , and when he 's with you , laugh at him and abuse him. There'sanother way if you could hit o n't .

Pray Sir cast off these fellows , as unfitting for your bareknowledge , and far more your companie : is't fit such Ragamuffins as theseare should bear the name of friends ? and furnish out a civil house ? ye'reto be married now , and men that love you must expect a course far fromyour old carrier : if you will keep 'em , turn 'em to th ' stable , and theremake 'em grooms : and yet now consider it , such beggars once set o ' horseback , you have heard will ride , how far you had best to look .
Hear you , you that must be Ladie , pray content your self andthink upon your carriage soon at night , what dressing will best take yourKnight , what wastcote , what cordial will do well i'th ' morning for him , what triers have you ?
What do you mean Sir ?
Those that must switch him up : if he start well , fear not but crySaint George , and bear him hard : when you perceive his wind growes hotand wanting , let him a little down , he 's fleet , ne 're doubt him , andstands sound .
Sir , you hear these fellows ?
Merrie companions , wench , Merry companions .
To one another let 'em be companions , but good Sir not to you : you shall be civil and slip off these base trappings .
He shall not need , my most swee [ t ] Ladie Grocer , if he be civil , not your powdered Sugar , nor your Raisins shall perswade the Captain tolive a Coxcomb with him ; let him be civil and eat i'th ' Arches , and seewhat will come o n't .
Let him be civil , doe : undo him ; I , that 's the next way. I willnot take ( if he be civil once ) two hundred pound a year to live with him ; be civil ? there 's a trim perswasion .
If thou beest civil Knight , as Jove defends it , get thee anothernose , that will be pull 'd off by the angry boyes for thy conversion : thechildren thou shalt get on this Civillian can not inherit by the law , th'are Ethnicks , and all thy sport meer Moral leacherie : when they aregrown , having but little in 'em , they may prove Haberdashers , or grossGrocers , like their dear Damm there : prethee be civil Knight , in time thoumaist read to thy houshold , and be drunk once a year : this would shewfinely .
I wonder sweet heart you will offer this , you do notunderstand these Gentlemen : I will be short and pithy : I had rather castyou off by the way of charge : these are Creatures , that nothing goes tothe maintenance of but Corn and Water. I will keep these fellows just inthe competencie of two Hens .
If you can cast it so Sir , you have my liking. If they eat less , Ishould not be offended : But how these Sir , can live upon so little as Cornand Water , I am unbelieving .
Why prethee sweet heart what 's your Ale ? is not that Corn andWater , my sweet Widow ?
I but my sweet Knight where 's the meat to this , and cloaths thatthey must look for ?
In this short sentence Ale , is all included : Meat , Drink , andCloth ; These are no ravening Footmen , no fellows , that at Ordinaries dareeat their eighteen pence thrice out before they rise , and yet goe hungryto play , and crack more nuts than would suffice a dozen Squirrels ; besidesthe din , which is damnable : I had rather rail , and be confin 'd to a
, than live amongst such rascals ; these are people of such aclean discretion in their diet , of such a moderate sustenance , that theysweat if they but smell hot meat. Porredge is poison , they hate aKitchin as they hate a Counter , and show 'em but a Feather-bed theyswound. Ale is their eating and their drinking surely , which keeps theirbodies clear , and soluble. Bread is a binder , and for that abolisht evenin their Ale , whose lost room fills an apple , which is more airy and ofsubtiler nature. The rest they take is little , and that little is little
bench , or a poor stubborn table ; if a chimny offer it self with some fewbroken rushes , they are in down : when they are sick , that 's drunk , theymay have fresh straw , else they do despise these worldly pamperings. Fortheir poor apparel , 't is worn out to the diet ; new they seek none , and ifa man should offer , they are angrie , scarce to be reconcil 'd again with
is modesty befitting my poor friends : you see their Wardrobe , thoughslender , competent : For shirts I take it , they are things worn out oftheir remembrance. Lousie they will be when they list , and mangie , whichshows a fine variety : and then to cure 'em , a Tanners limepit , which islittle charge , two dogs , and these ; these two may be cur 'd for 3. pence .
You have half perswaded me , pray use your pleasure : and my goodfriends since I do know your diet , I'le take an order , meat shall notoffend you , you shall have Ale .
We ask no more , let it be , mighty Lady : and if we perish , then ourown sins on us .

Servant .
Sir , there 's a Gentleman without would speak with you .
Bid him come in .
Welford .
By your leave Sir .
You are welcome , what 's your will Sir ?
Have you forgotten me ?
I do not much remember you .
You must Sir. I am that Gentleman you pleas 'd to wrong , in yourdisguise , I have inquired you out .
I was disguised indeed Sir if I wrong 'd you , pray where andwhen ?
In such a Ladies house , I need not name her .
I do remember you , you seem 'd to be a Sutor to that Lady ?
If you remember this , do not forget how scurvily you us 'd me : thatwas no place to quarrel in , pray you think of it ; if you be honest youdare fight with me , without more urging , else I must provoke ye .
Sir I dare fight , but never for a woman , I will not have herin my cause , she 's mortal , and so is not my anger : if you have brought anobler subject for our Swords , I am for you ; in this I would be loth toprick my Finger. And where you say I wrong 'd you , 't is so far from myprofession , that amongst my fears , to do wrong is the greatest : credit mewe have been both abused , ( not by our selves , for that I hold a spleen , nosin of malice , and may with man enough be best forgoten , ) but by thatwillfull , scornful piece of hatred , that much forgetful Lady : for whosesake , if we should leave our reason , and run on upon our sense , like
, the little world of good men would laugh at us , and despise us , fixing upon our desperate memories the never-worn out names of Fools andFencers. Sir 't is not fear , but reason makes me tell you ; in this I hadrather help you Sir , than hurt you , and you shall find it , though youthrow your self into as many dangers as she offers , though you redeem herlost name every day , and find her out new honours with your Sword , youshall but be her mirth as I have been .
I ask you mercy Sir , you have ta'ne my edge off : yet I would fainbe even with this Lady .
In which I'le be your helper : we are two , and they are two : two Sisters , rich alike , only the elder has the prouder Dowry : In troth Ipity this disgrace in you , yet of mine own I am senceless : do but followmy Counsel , and I'le pawn my spirit , we'l overreach 'em yet ; the means isthis --

Sir there 's a Gentlewoma [ n ] will needs speak with you , I cannotkeep her out , she 's entred Sir .
It is the waiting woman , pray be not seen : sirrah hold her indiscourse a while : hark in your ear , go and dispatch it quickly , when Icome in , I'le tell you all the project .

Pray leave these frumps Sir , and receive this letter .
From whom good vanity ?
'T is from my Lady Sir : Alas good soul , she cries and takes on !
Do 's she so good Soul ? wou 'd she not have a Cawdle ? do 's shesend you with your fine Oratory goody Tully to tye me to believe again ? bring out the Cat-hounds , I'le make you take a tree Whore , then with mytiller bring down your Gibship , and then have you cast , and hung upi'th ' Warren .
I am no beast Sir , would you knew it .
Wou 'd I did , for I am yet very doubtful ; what will you saynow ?
Nothing not I .
Art thou a woman , and say nothing ?
Unless you'l hear me with more moderation , I can speak wiseenough .
And loud enough ? will your Lady love me ?
It seems so by her letter , and her lamentations ; but you are suchanother man .
Not such another as I was , Mumps ; nor will not be : I'le readher fine Epistle : ha , ha , ha , is not thy Mistress mad ?
For you she will be , 't is a shame you should use a poorGentlewoman so untowardly ; she loves the ground you tread on ; and you ( hard heart ) because she jested with you , mean to kill her ; 't is a fineconquest as they say .
Hast thou so much moisture in the Whitleather hide yet , thatthou canst cry ? I wou 'd have sworn thou hadst been touchwood five yearsince ; nay let it rain , thy face chops for a shower like a dry Dunghil .
I'le not indure this Ribauldry ; farewel i'th ' Devils name ; if myLady die , I'le be sworn before a Jury , thou art the cause o n't .
Do Maukin do , deliver to your Lady from me this : I mean to seeher , if I have no other business : which before I'le want to come to her , Imean to go seek birds nests : yet I may come too : but if I come , from thisdoor till I see her , will I think how to rail vildly at her ; how to vexher , and make her cry so much , that the Physician if she fall sick upo n't , shall find the cause to be want of Urine , and she remediless dye in her
Th'art a vile man , God bless my issue from thee .

Lady alone .
Is it not strange that every womans will should track out newwayes to disturb her self ? if I should call my reason to account , itcannot answer why I keep my self from mine own wish , and stop the man Ilove from his ; and every hour repent again , yet still go on : I know 'tislike a man , that wants his natural sleep , and growing dull would gladlygive the remnant of his life for two hours rest ; yet through hisfrowardness , will rather choose to watch another man , drowsie as he , thantake his own repose. All this I know : yet a strange peevishness and anger , not to have the power to do things unexpected , carries me away to mine own
people think I love , and do't with oaths , and am in earnest then : O whatare we ! Men , you must answer this , that dare obey such things as wecommand. How now ? what newes ?
Abigal .
Faith Madam none worth hearing .
Is he not come ?
No truly .
Nor has he writ ?
Neither. I pray God you have not undone your self .
Why , but what saies he ?
Faith he talks strangely .
How strangely ?
First at your Letter he laught extremely .
What , in contempt ?
He laught monstrous loud , as he would die , and when you wrote it Ithink you were in no such merry mood , to provoke him that way : and havingdone he cried Alas for her , and violently laught again .
Did he ?
Yes , till I was angry .
Angry , why ? why wert thou angry ? he did doe but well , I diddeserve it , he had been a fool , an unfit man for any one to love , had henot laught thus at me : you were angry , that show 'd your folly ; I shalllove him more for that , than all that ere he did before : but said henothing else ?
Many uncertain things : he said though you had mockt him , becauseyou were a woman , he could wish to do you so much favour as to see you : yet he said , he knew you rash , and was loth to offend you with the sightof one , whom now he was bound not to leave .
What one was that ?
I know not , but truly I do fear there is a making up there : for Iheard the servants , as I past by some , whisper such a thing : and as I cameback through the hall , there were two or three Clarks writing greatconveyances in hast , which they said were for their Mistris joynture .
'T is very like , and fit it should be so , for he does think , andreasonably think , that I should keep him with my idle tricks for ever erehe be married .
At last he said , it should go hard but he would see you for yoursatisfaction .
All we that are called Women , know as well as men , it were a farmore noble thing to grace where we are grace't , and give respect therewhere we are respected : yet we practise a wilder course , and never bendour eyes on men with pleasure , till they find the way to give us a
and dote to death .

Now I see him , if my heart swell not again ( away thou womanspride ) so that I can not speak a gentle word to him , let me not live .
By your leave here .
How now , what new trick invites you hither ? Ha'you a fine device again ?
Faith this is the finest device I have now : How dost thou sweet heart ?
Why very well , so long as I may pleaseYou my dear Lover. I nor can , nor willBe ill when you are well , well when you are ill .
O thy sweet temper ! what would I have given , that Lady hadbeen like thee : seest thou her ? that face ( my love ) join 'd with thy humblemind , had made a wench indeed .
Alas my love , what God hath done , I dare not think to mend. I useno paint , nor any drugs of Art , my hands and face will shew it .
Why what thing have you brought to shew us there ? do you take monyfor it ?
A Godlike thing , not to be bought for mony : 't is my Mistris : in whom there is no passion , nor no scorn : what I will is for law ; prayyou salute her .
Salute her ? by this good light , I would not kiss her for half mywealth .
Why ? why pray you ? You shall see me do't afore you ; look you .
Now fie upon thee , a beast would not have don't.I would not kiss thee of a month to gain a Kingdom .
Marry you shall not be troubled .
Why was there ever such a Meg as this ? Sure thou art mad .
I was mad once , when I lov 'd pictures ; for what are shape andcolours else , but pictures ? in that tawnie hide there lies an endless massof vertues , when all your red and white ones want it .
And this is she you are to marry , is't not ?
Yes indeed is't .
God give you joy .
Amen .
I thank yo [ u ] , as unknown for your good wish.The like to you when ever you shall wed .
O gentle Spirit !
You thank me ? I prayKeep your breath nearer you , I do not like it .
I would not willingly offend at all , Much less a Lady of your worthie parts .
Sweet , Sweet !
I do not think this woman can by nature be thus , Thus ugly ; sure she 's some common Strumpet , Deform 'd with exercise of sin ?
O Sir believe not this , for Heaven so comfort me as I am free fromfoul pollution with any man ; my honour ta'ne away , I am no woman .
Arise my dearest Soul ; I do not credit it. Alas , I fear hertender heart will break with this reproach ; fie that you know no morecivility to a weak Virgin. 'T is no matter Sweet , let her say what shewill , thou art not worse to me , and therefore not at all ; be careless .
For all things else I would , but for mine honor ; Me thinks .
Alas , thine honour is not stain 'd , Is this the business that you sent for me about ?
Faith Sister you are much to blame , to use a woman , whatsoe 're shebe , thus ; I'le salute her : You are welcome hither .
I humbly thank you .
Milde yet as the Dove , for all these injuries. Come shall wegoe , I love thee not so ill to keep thee here a jesting stock. Adue to theworlds end .
Why whither now ?
Nay you shall never know , because you shall not find me .
I pray let me speak with you .
'T is very well : come .
I pray you let me speak with you .
Yes for another mock .
By Heaven I have no mocks : good Sir a word .
Though you deserve not so much at my hands , yet if you be insuch earnest , I'le speak a word with you ; but I beseech you be brief : forin good faith there 's a Parson and a licence stay for us i'th ' Church allthis while : and you know 't is night .
Sir , give me hearing patiently , and whatsoever I have heretoforespoke jestingly , forget : for as I hope for mercy any where , what I shallutter now is from my heart , and as I mean .
Well , well , what do you mean ?
Was not I once your Mistress , and you my Servant ?
O 't is about the old matter .
Nay good Sir stay me out ; I would but hear you excuse your self , why you should take this woman , and leave me .
Prethee why not , deserves she not as much as you ?
I think not , if you will lookWith an indifferency upon us both .
Upon your faces , 't is true : but if judiciously we shall castour eyes upon your minds , you are a thousand women of her in worth : shecannot swound in jest , nor set her lover tasks , to shew her peevishness , and his affection , nor cross what he saies , though it be Canonical. She'sa good plain wench , that will do as I will have her , and bring me lustyBoys to throw the Sledge , and lift at Pigs of Lead : and for a Wife , she'sfar beyond you : what can you do in a houshold to provide for your issue , but lye i ' bed and get 'em ? your business is to dress you , and at idlehours to eat ; when she can do a thousand profitable things : she can dopretty well in the Pastry , and knows how Pullen should be cram 'd , she cutsCambrick at a thread , weaves Bone-lace , and quilts Balls ; and what are yougood for ?
Admit it true , that she were far beyond me in all respects , doesthat give you a licence to forswear your self ?
Forswear my self , how ?
Perhaps you have forgotten the innumerable oaths you have utter'din disclaiming all for Wives but me : I'le not remember you : God give youjoy .
Nay but conceive me , the intent of oaths is ever understood : Admit I should protest to such a friend , to see him at his Lodging to
hid him where my diligent search could not find him : so there were nocross act of mine own in't. Can it be imagined I mean to force you toMarriage , and to have you whether you will or no ?
Alas you need not. I make already tender of my self , and then youare forsworn .
Some sin I see indeed must necessarily fall upon me , aswhosoever deals with Women shall never utterly avoid it : yet I would chusethe least ill ; which is to forsake you , that have done me all the abusesof a malignant Woman , contemn 'd my service , and would have held me pratingabout Marriage , till I had been past getting of Children : then her thathath forsaken her Family , and put her tender body in my hand , upon myword --
Which of us swore you first to ?
Why to you .
Which oath is to be kept then ?
I prethee do not urge my sins unto me , Without I could amend 'em .
Why you may by wedding me .
How will that satisfie my word to her ?
'T is not to be kept , and needs no satisfaction , 'T is an error fit for repentance only .
Shall I live to wrong that tender hearted Virgin so ? It maynot be .
Why may it not be ?
I swear I would rather marry thee than her : but yet minehonesty ?
What honesty ? 'T is more preserv 'd this way : Come , by this light , servant , thou shalt , I'le kiss thee o n't .
This kiss indeed is sweet , pray God no sin lie under it .
There is no sin at all , try but another .
O my heart !
Help Sister , this Lady swounds .
How do you ?
Why very well , if you be so .
Since a quiet mind lives not in any Woman , I shall do a mostungodly thing. Hear me one word more , which by all my hopes I will notalter , I did make an oath when you delai 'd me so , that this very night Iwould be married. Now if you will go without delay , suddenly , as late asit is , with your own Minister to your own Chapel , I'le wed you and to bed .
A match dear servant .
For if you should forsake me now , I care not , she would notthough for all her injuries , such is her spirit. If I be not ashamed tokiss her now I part , may I not live .
I see you go , as slily as you think to steal away : yet I will prayfor you ; all blessings of the world light on you two , that you may live tobe an aged pair. All curses on me if I do not speak what I do wish indeed .
If I can speak to purpose to her , I am a villain .
Servant away .
Sister , will you Marry that inconstant man ? think you he will notcast you off to morrow , to wrong a Lady thus , lookt she like dirt , 'twasbasely done. May you ne 're prosper with him .
Now God forbid. Alas I was unworthy , so I told him .
That was your modesty , too good for him.I would not see your wedding for a world .

Dry up your eyes forsooth , you shall not think we are all suchuncivil beasts as these. Would I knew how to give you a revenge .
So would not I : No let me suffer truly , that I desire .
Pray walk in with me , 't is very late , and you shall stay all night : your bed shall be no worse than mine ; I wish I could but do you right .
My humble thanks : God grant I may but live to quit your love. [ Exeunt .
Young Loveless and Savil .
Did your Master send for me Savil ?
Yes , he did send for your worship Sir .
Do you know the business ?
Alas Sir , I know nothing , nor am imployed beyond my hours ofeating. My dancing days are done Sir .
What art thou now then ?
If you consider me in little , I am with your worships reverenceSir , a Rascal : one that upon the next anger of your Brother , must raise asconce by the high way , and sell switches ; my wife is learning now Sir , toweave inkle .
What dost thou mean to do with thy Children Savil ?
My eldest boy is half a Rogue already , he was born bursten , andyour worship knows , that is a pretty step to mens compassions. My youngestboy I purpose Sir to bind for ten years to a G [ ao ] ler , to draw under him , that he may shew us mercy in his function .
Your family is quartered with discretion : you are resolved toCant then : where Savil shall your scene lie ?
Beggers must be no chusers.In every place ( I take it ) but the stocks .
This is your drinking , and your whoring Savil , I told you ofit , but your heart was hardened .
'T is true , you were the first that told me of it I do remember yetin tears , you told me you would have Whores , and in that passion Sir , youbroke out thus ; Thou miserable man , repent , and brew three Strikes more ina Hogshead. 'T is noon e 're we be drunk now , and the time can tarry for noman .
Y'are grown a bitter Gentleman. I see misery can clear yourhead better than Mustard , I'le be a sutor for your Keys again Sir .
Will you but be so gracious to me Sir ? I shall be bound .
You shall SirTo your bunch again , or I'le miss foully .
Morecraft .
Save you Gentleman , save you .
Now Polecat , what young Rabets nest have you to draw ?
Come , prethee be familiar Knight .
Away Fox , I'le send for Terriers for you .
Thou art wide yet : I'le keep thee companie .
I am about some business ; Indentures , If ye follow me I'le beat you : take heed , A [ s ] I live I'le cancel your Coxcomb .
Thou art cozen 'd now , I am no usurer : What poor fellow 's this ?
I am poor indeed Sir .
Give him mony Knight .
Do you begin the offering .
There poor fellow , here 's an Angel for thee .
Art thou in earnest Morecraft ?
Yes faith Knight , I'le follow thy example : thou hadst land andthousands , thou spendst , and flungst away , and yet it flows in double : Ipurchased , wrung , and wierdraw 'd , for my wealth , lost , and was cozen 'd : for which I make a vow , to trie all the waies above ground , but I'le finda constant means to riches without curses .
I am glad of your conversion Master Morecraft : Y'are in a fair course , pray pursue it still .
Come , we are all gallants now , I'le keep thee company ; Here honest fellow , for this Gentlemans sake , there 's two Angels more forthee .
God quite you Sir , and keep you long in this mind .
Wilt thou persevere ?
Till I have a penny. I have brave cloathes a making , and twohorses ; canst thou not help me to a match Knight , I'le lay a thousandpound upon my crop-ear .
Foot , this is stranger than an Africk monster , There will beno more talk of the Cleve wars Whilst this lasts , come , I'le put theeinto blood .
Would all his damn 'd tribe were as tender hearted. I beseech youlet this Gentleman join with you in the recovery of my Keyes ; I like hisgood beginning Sir , the whilst I'le pray for both your worships .
He shall Sir .
Shall we goe noble Knight ? I would fain be acquainted .
I'le be your Servant Sir. [ Exeunt .
Elder Loveless , and Lady .
Faith my sweet Lady , I have caught you now , maugre yoursubtilties , and fine devices , be coy again now .
Prethee sweet-heart tell true .
By this light , by all the pleasures I have had this night , byyour lost maidenhead , you are cozened meerly. I have cast beyond your wit.That Gentleman is your retainer Welford .
It can not be so .
Your Sister has found it so , or I mistake , mark how sheblushes when you see her next. Ha , ha , ha , I shall not travel now , ha , ha , ha .
Prethee sweet heart be quiet , thou hast angred me at heart .
I'le please you soon again .
Welford ?
I Welford , hee 's a young handsome fellow , well bred andlanded , your Sister can instruct you in his good parts , better than I bythis time .
Uds foot am I fetcht over thus ?
Yes i'faith.And over shall be fetcht again , never fear it .
I must be patient , though it torture me : You have got the Sun Sir .
And the Moon too , in which I'le be the man .
But had I known this , had I but surmiz 'd it , you should havehunted three trains more , before you had come to th ' course , you shouldhave hankt o'th ' bridle , Sir , i'faith .
I knew it , and min 'd with you , and so blew you up.Now you may see the Gentlewoman : stand close .
Welford , and Martha .
For Gods sake Sir , be private in this business , You have undone me else. O God , what have I done ?
No harm I warrant thee .
How shall I look upon my friends again ? With what face ?
Why e'ne with that : 't is a good one , thou canst not find a better : look upon all the faces thou shall see there , and you shall find 'emsmooth still , fair still , sweet still , and to your thinking honest ; thosehave done as much as you have yet , or dare doe Mistris , and yet they keepno stir .
Good Sir goe in , and put your womans cloaths on : If you be seen thus , I am lost for ever .
I'le watch you for that Mistris : I am no fool , here will I tarrytill the house be up and witness with me .
Good dear friend goe in .
To bed again if you please , else I am fixt here till there benotice taken what I am , and what I have done : if you could juggle me intomy woman-hood again , and so cog me out of your company , all this would beforsworn , and I again an asinego , as your Sister left me. No , I'le haveit known and publisht ; then if you'le be a whore , forsake me and beasham 'd : and when you can hold no longer , marry some cast Cleve Captain , and sell Bottle-ale .
I dare not stay Sir , use me modestly , I am your wife .
Goe in , I'le make up all .
I'le be a witness of your naked truth Sir : this is theGentlewoman , prethee look upon him , that is he that made me break my faith
What a dull ass was I , I could not see this wencher from a wench : twenty to one , if I had been but tender like my Sister , he had served mesuch a slippery trick too .
Twenty to one I had .
I would have watcht you Sir , by your good patience , forferreting in my ground .
You have been with my Sister .
Yes to bring .
An heir into the world he means .
There is no chafing now .
I have had my part o n't : I have been chaft this three hours , that'sthe least , I am reasonable cool now .
Can not you fare well , but you must cry roast-meat ?
He that fares well , and will not bless the founders , is eithersurfeited , or ill taught , Lady , for mine own part , I have found so sweet adiet , I can commend it , though I can not spare it .
How like you this dish , Welford , I made a supper o n't , andfed so heartily , I could not sleep .
By this light , had I but scented out your [ train ] , ye had sleptwith a bare pillow in your arms and kist that , or else the bed-post , forany wife ye had got this twelve-month yet : I would have vext you more thana try 'd post-horse ; and been longer bearing , than ever after-game at
was. Lord , that I were unmarried again .
Lady I would not undertake ye , were you again a Haggard , forthe best cast of four Ladys i'th ' Kingdom : you were ever tickle-footed , and would not truss round .
Is she fast ?
She was all night lockt here boy .
Then you may lure her without fear of losing : take off her Cranes.You have a delicate Gentlewoman to your Sister : Lord what a prettie furieshe was in , when she perceived I was a man : but I thank God I satisfiedher scruple , without the Parson o'th ' town .
What did ye ?
Madam , can you tell what we did ?
She has a shrewd guess at it I see it by her .
Well you may mock us : but my large Gentlewoman , my Mary Ambre , had I but seen into you , you should have had another bed-fellow , fitter agreat deal for your itch .
I thank you Lady , me thought it was well , You are so curious .
Young Loveless , his Lady , Morecraft , Savil , and twoServingmen .
Get on your doublet , here comes my Brother .
Good morrow Brother , and all good to your Lady .
God save you and good morrow to you all .
Good morrow. Here 's a poor brother of yours .
Fie how this shames me .
Prethee good fellow help me to a cup of beer .
I will Sir .
Brother what makes you here ? will this Lady do ? Will she ? is she not nettl 'd still ?
No I have cur 'd her.Mr. Welford , pray know this Gentleman is my Brother .
Sir I shall long to love him .
I shall not be your debter Sir. But how is't with you ?
As well as may be man : I am married : your new acquaintancehath her Sister , and all 's well .
I am glad on't. Now my prettie Lady Sister , How do you find my Brother ?
Almost as wild as you are .
He will make the better husband : you have tried him ?
Against my will Sir .
Hee'l make your will amends soon , do not doubt it.But Sir I must intreat you to be better knownTo this converted Jew here .
Here 's Beer for you Sir .
And here 's for you an Angel : Pray buy no Land , 'twill never prosper Sir .
How 's this ?
Bless you , and then I'le tell : He 's turn 'd Gallant .
Gallant ?
I Gallant , and is now called , Cutting Morecraft : The reason I'le inform you at more leisure .
O good Sir let me know him presently .
You shall hug one another .
Sir I must keep you company .
And reason .
Cutting Morecraft faces about , I must present another .
As many as you will Sir , I am for 'em .
Sir I shall do you service .
I shall look for't in good faith Sir .
Prethee good sweet heart kiss him .
Who , that fellow ?
Sir will it please you to remember me : my keys good Sir .
I'le doe it presently .
Come thou shalt kiss him for our sport sake .
Let him come on then ; and do you hear , do not instruct me in thesetricks , for you may repent it .
That at my peril. Lusty Mr. Morecraft , Here is a Lady would salute you .
She shall not lose her longing Sir : what is she ?
My wife Sir .
She must be then my Mistres .
Must I Sir ?
O yes , you must .
And you must take this ring , a poor pawnOf some fiftie pound .
Take it by any means , 't is lawfull prize .
Sir I shall call you servant .
I shall be proud o n't : what fellow 's that ?
My Ladies Coachman .
There 's something , ( my friend ) for you to buy whips , And for you Sir , and you Sir .
Under a miracle this is the strangestI ever heard of .
What , shall we play , or drink ? what shall we doe ? Who will hunt with me for a hundred pounds ?
Stranger and Stranger ! Sir you shall find sport after a day or two .
Sir I have a sute unto youConcerning your old servant Savil .
O , for his keys , I know it .
Now Sir , strike in .
Sir I must have you grant me .
'T is done Sir , take your keys again : But hark you Savil , leave off the motionsOf the flesh , and be honest , or else you shall graze again : I'le try you once more .
If ever I be taken drunk , or whoring , Take off the biggest key i'th ' bunch , and openMy head with it Sir : I humbly thank your worships .
Nay then I see we must keep holiday .
Roger , and Abigal.Here 's the last couple in hell .
Joy be among you all .
Why how now Sir , what is the meaning of this emblem ?
Marriage a n't like your worship .
Are you married ?
As well as the next Priest could doe it , Madam .
I think the sign 's in Gemini , here 's such coupling .
Sir Roger , what will you take to lie from your sweet-heart tonight ?
Not the best benefice in your worships gift Sir .
A whorson , how he swells .
How many times to night Sir Roger ?
Sir you grow scurrilous : What I shall do , I shall do : I shall not need your help .
For horse flesh Roger .
Come prethee be not angry , 't is a dayGiven wholly to our mirth .
It shall be so Sir : Sir Roger and his Bride , We shall intreat to be at our charge .
Welford get you to the Church : by this light , You shall not lie with her again , till y'are married .
I am gone .
To every Bride I dedicate this daySix healths a piece , and it shall goe hard , But every one a Jewell : Come be mad boys .

Leandro paid all .
'T is his usual custom , And requisite he should : he has now put offThe Funeral black , ( your rich heir wears with joy , When he pretends to weep for his dead Father ) Your gathering Sires , so long heap muck together , That their kind Sons , to rid them of their care , Wish them in Heaven ; or if they take a tasteOf Purgatory by the way , it matters not , Provided they remove hence ; what is befalnTo his Father , in the other world , I ask not ; I am sure his prayer is heard : would I could use oneFor mine , in the same method .
Fie upon thee.This is prophane .
Good Doctor , do not school meFor a fault you are not free from : On my lifeWere all Heirs in Corduba , put to their Oaths , They would confess with me , 't is a sound Tenet : I am sure Leandro do 's .
He is th'ownerOf a fair Estate .
And fairly he deserves it , He 's a Royal Fellow : yet observes a meanIn all his courses , careful too on whomHe showers his bounties : he that 's liberalTo all alike , may do a good by chance , But never out of Judgment : This invitesThe prime men of the City to frequentAll places he resorts to , and are happyIn his sweet Converse .
Don Jamie the BrotherTo the Grandee Don Henrique , appears much takenWith his behaviour .
There is something more i n't : He needs his Purse , and knows how to make use on't.'Tis now in fashion for your Don , that 's poor , To vow all Leagues of friendship with a MerchantThat can supply his wants , and howsoe 're
noble born , his elder Brother
rich , and his Revenues long sinceEncreas 'd by marrying with a wealthy HeirCall 'd , Madam Vi [ o ] lante , he yet holdsA hard hand o 're Jamie , allowing himA bare annuity only .
Yet 't is saidHe hath no child , and by the Laws of SpainIf he die without issue , Don JamieInherits his Estate .
Why that 's the reasonOf their so many jarrs : though the young LordBe sick of the elder Brother , and in reasonShould flatter , and observe him , he 's of a natureToo bold and fierce , to stoop so , but bears up , Presuming on his hopes .
What 's the young LadThat all of 'em make so much of ?
'T is a sweet one , And the best condition 'd youth , I ever saw yet , So humble , and so affable , that he winsThe love of all that know him , and so modest , That ( in despight of poverty ) he would starveRather than ask a courtesie : He 's the SonOf a poor cast-Captain , one Octavio ; And She , that once was call 'd th'fair Jacinta , Is happy in being his Mother : for his sake,
Jamie , Leandro , and Ascanio. ( Though in their Fortunes faln ) they are esteem 'd of , And cherish 'd by the best. O here they come.I now may spare his Character , but observe him , He'l justifie my report .
My good Ascanio , Repair more often to me : above WomenThou ever shalt be welcome .
My Lord your favoursMay quickly teach a raw untutour 'd YouthTo be both rude and sawcy .
You can not beToo frequent where you are so much desir 'd : And give me leave ( dear friend ) to be your RivalIn part of his affection ; I will buy itAt any rate .
Stood I but now possess'dOf what my future hope presages to me , I then would make it clear thou hadst a PatronThat would not say but do : yet as I am , Be mine , I'le not receive thee as a servant , But as my Son , ( and though I want my self ) No Page attending in the Court of SpainShall find a kinder master .
I beseech youThat my refusal of so great an offerMay make no ill construction , 't is not pride ( That common vice is far from my condition ) That makes you a denyal to receiveA favour I should sue for : nor the fashionWhich the Country follows , in which to be a servantIn those that groan beneath the heavy weightOf poverty , is held an argumentOf a base abject mind , I wish my yearsWere fit to do you service in a natureThat might become a Gentleman ( give me leaveTo think my self one ) My Father serv 'd the KingAs a Captain in the field ; and though his fortuneReturn 'd him home a poor man , he was richIn Reputation , and wounds fairly taken.Nor am I by his ill success deterr 'd , I rather feel a strong desire that sways meTo follow his profession , and if HeavenHath mark 'd me out to be a man , how proud , In the service of my Country , should I be , To trail a Pike under your brave command ! There , I would follow you as a guide to honour , Though all the horrours of the War made upTo stop my passage .
Thou art a hopeful Boy , And it was bravely spoken : For this answer , I love thee more than ever .
Pity such seedsOf promising courage should not grow and prosper .
What ever his reputed Parents be , He hath a mind that speaks him right and noble .
You make him blush ; it needs not sweet Ascanio , We may hear praises when they are deserv 'd , Our modesty unwounded. By my lifeI would add something to the building upSo fair a mind , and if till you are fitTo bear Arms in the Field , you'l spend some yearsIn Salamanca , I'le supply your studiesWith all conveniences .
Your goodness ( Signiors ) And charitable favours overwhelm me.If I were of your blood , you could not beMore tender of me : what then can I pay ( A poor Boy and a stranger ) but a heartBound to your service ? with what willingnessI would receive ( good Sir ) your noble offer , Heaven can bear witness for me : but alas , Should I embrace the means to raise my fortunes , I must destroy the lives of my poor Parents ( To who [ m ] I ow my being ) they in mePlace all their comforts , and ( as if I wereThe light of their dim eyes ) are so indulgentThey can not brook one short dayes absence from me ; And ( what will hardly win belief ) though young , I am their Steward and their Nurse : the bountiesWhich others bestow on me serves to sustain 'em , And to forsake them in their age , in meWere more than Murther .
Henrique .
This is a kind of beggingWould make a Broker charitable .
Here , ( sweet heart ) I wish it were more .
When this is spent , Seek for supply from me .
Thy pietyFor ever be remembred : nay take all , Though 'twere my exhibition to a RoyalFor one whole year .
High Heavens reward your goodness .
So Sir , is this a slip of your own grafting , You are so prodigal ?
A slip Sir ?
Yes , A slip ; or call it by the proper name , Your Bastard .
You are foul-mouth 'd ; do not provoke me , I shall forget your Birth if you proceed , And use you , ( as your manners do deserve ) uncivilly .
So brave ! pray you give me hearing , Who am I Sir ?
My elder Brother : OneThat might have been born a fool , and so reputed , But that you had the luck to creep intoThe world a year before me .
Be more temperate .
I neither can nor will , unless I learn itBy his example : let him use his harshUnsavoury reprehensions upon thoseThat are his Hinds , and not on me. The LandOur Father left to him alone rewards him , For being twelve months elder , let that beForgotten , and let his Parasites rememberOne quality of worth or vertue in himThat may authorize him , to be a censurerOf me , or my manners , and I willAcknowledge him for a Tutor , till then , never .
From whom have you your means Sir ?
From the willOf my dead Father ; I am sure I spend notNor give't upon your purse .
But will it hold outWithout my help ?
I am sure it shall , I'le sink else , For sooner I will seek aid from a Whore , Than a courtesie from you .
'T is well ; you are proud ofYour new Exchequer , when you have cheated himAnd worn him to the quick , I may be foundIn the List of your acquaintance .
Pray you holdAnd give me leave ( my Lord ) to say thus much ( And in mine own defence ) I am no GullTo be wrought on by perswasion : nor no CowardTo be beaten out of my means , but know to whomAnd why I give or lend , and will do nothingBut what my reason warrants ; you may beAs sparing as you please , I must be boldTo make use of my own , without your licence .
'Pray thee let him alone , he is not worth thy anger.All that he do 's ( Leandro ) is for my good , I think there 's not a Gentleman of Spain , That has a better Steward , than I have of him .
Your Steward Sir ?
Yes , and a provident one : Why , he knows I am given to large expence , And therefore lays up for me : could you believe elseThat he , that sixteen years hath worn the yokeOf barren wedlock , without hope of issue ( His Coffers full , his Lands and Vineyards fruitful ) Could be so sold to base and sordid thrift , As almost to deny himself , the meansAnd necessaries of life ? Alas , he knowsThe Laws of Spain appoint me for his Heir , That all must come to me , if I out-live him , Which sure I must do , by the course of Nature , And the assistance of good Mirth , and Sack , How ever you prove Melancholy .
If I live , Thou dearly shalt repent this .
When thou art dead , I am sure I shall not .
Now they begin to burnLike oppos 'd Meteors .
Give them line , and way , My life for Don Jamie .
Continue stillThe excellent Husband , and joyn Farm to Farm , Suffer no Lordship , that in a clear dayFalls in the prospect of your covetous eyeTo be anothers ; forget you are a Grandee ; Take use upon use , and cut the throats of HeirsWith cozening Mortgages : rack your poor Tenants , Till they look like so many SkeletonsFor want of Food ; and when that Widows curses , The ruines of ancient Families , tears of OrphansHave hurried you to the Devil , ever rememberAll was rak 'd up for me ( your thankful Brother ) That will dance merrily upon your Grave , And perhaps give a double PistoletTo some poor needy Frier , to say a MassTo keep your Ghost from walking .
That the LawShould force me to endure this !
Verily , When this shall come to pass ( as sure it will ) If you can find a loop-hole , though in Hell , To look on my behaviour , you shall see meRansack your Iron Chests , and once again
flame-colour 'd Daughter shall be freeTo domineer in Taverns , Masques , and RevelsAs she was us 'd before she was your Captive.Me thinks the meer conceipt of it , should make youGo home sick , and distemper 'd ; if it do 's , I'le send you a Doctor of mine own , and afterTake order for your Funeral .
You have said , Sir , I will not fight with words , but deeds to tame you , Rest confident I will , and thou shalt wishThis day thou hadst been dumb. -- [ Exit .
You have given him a heat , But with your own distemper .
Not a whit , Now he is from mine eye , I can be merry , Forget the cause and him : all plagues go with him , Let 's talk of something else : what news is stirring ? Nothing to pass the time ?
'Faith it is saidThat the next Summer will determine muchOf that we long have talk 'd of , touching the Wars .
What have we to do with them ? Let us discourseOf what concerns our selves. 'T is now in fashionTo have your Gallants set down in a Tavern , What the Arch-Dukes purpose is the next spring , and whatDefence my Lords ( the States ) prepare : what courseThe Emperour takes against the encroaching Turk , And whether his Moony-standards are design'dFor Persia or Polonia : and all thisThe wiser sort of State-Worms seem to knowBetter than their own affairs : this is discourseFit for the Council it concerns ; we are young , And if that I might give the Theme , 'twere betterTo talk of handsome Women .
And that 's one , Almost as general .
Yet none agreeWho are the fairest .
Some prefer the French , For their conceited Dressings : some the plump
, some the StateThat ours observe ; and I have heard one swear , ( A merry friend of mine ) that once in London , He did enjoy the company of a Gamester , ( A common Gamester too ) that in one nightMet him th ' Italian , French , and Spanish wayes , And ended in the Dutch ; for to cool her self , She kiss 'd him drunk in the morning .
We may spareThe travel of our tongues in forraign Nations , When in Corduba , if you dare give creditTo my report ( for I have seen her , Gallants ) There lives a Woman ( of a mean birth too , And meanly match 'd ) whose all-excelling FormDisdains comparison with any SheThat puts in for a fair one , and though you borrowFrom every Country of the Earth the bestOf those perfections , which the Climat yieldsTo help to make her up , if put in Ballance , This will weigh down the Scale .
You talk of wonders .
She is indeed a wonder , and so kept , And , as the world deserv 'd not to beholdWhat curious Nature made without a pattern , Whose Copy she hath lost too , she 's shut up , Sequestred from the world .
Who is the ownerOf such a Jem ? I am fire 'd .
One Bartolus , A wrangling Advocate .
A knave on Record .
I am sure he cheated me of the best partOf my Estate .
Some Business calls me hence , ( And of importance ) which denies me leisureTo give you his full character : In few words ( Though rich ) he 's covetous beyond expression , And to encrease his heap , will dare the Devil , And all the plagues of darkness : and to theseSo jealous , as if you would parallelOld Argus to him , you must multiplyHis Eyes an hundred times : of these none sleep.He that would charm the heaviest lid , must hireA better Mercurie , than Jove made use of : Bless your selves from the thought of him and her , For 'twill be labour lost : So farewel Signiors. -- [ Exit .

Octavio , and Jacinta .
You met Don Henrique ?
Yes .
What comfort bring you ? Speak cheerfully : how did my letter workOn his hard temper ? I am sure I wrote itSo feelingly , and with the pen of sorrow , That it must force Compunction .
You are cozen 'd ; Can you with one hand prop a falling Tower ? Or with the other stop the raging main , When it breaks in on the usurped shore ? Or any thing that is impossible ? And then conclude that there is some way left , To move him to compassion .
Is there a JusticeOr thunder ( my Octavio ) and heNot sunk unto the center ?
Good Jacinta , With your long practised patience bear afflictions , And by provoking call not on Heavens anger , He did not only scorn to read your letter , But ( most inhumane as he is ) he cursed you , Cursed you most bitterly .
The bad mans charity.Oh that I could forget there were a Tye , In me , upon him ! or the relief I seek , ( If given ) were bounty in him , and not debt , Debt of a dear accompt !
Touch not that string , 'Twill but encrease your sorrow : and tame silence , ( The Balm of the oppressed ) which hithertoHath eas 'd your griev 'd soul , and preserv 'd your fame , Must be your Surgeon still .
If the contagionOf my misfortunes had not spread it selfUpon my Son Ascanio , though my wantsWere centupli 'd upon my self , I could be patient : But he is so good , I so miserable , His pious care , his duty , and obedience , And all that can be wish 'd for from a Son , Discharg 'd to me , and I , barr 'd of all meansTo return any scruple of the debtI owe him as a Mother , is a Torment , Too painfull to be born .
I suffer with you , In that ; yet find in this assurance comfort , High Heaven ordains ( whose purposes can not alter )
Ascanio.Children that pay obedience to their Parents , Shall never beg their Bread .
Here comes our joy , Where has my dearest been ?
I have made , Mother , A fortunate voyage and brought home rich prize , In a few hours : the owners too contented , From whom I took it. See here 's Gold , good store too , Nay , pray you take it .
Mens Charities are so cold , That if I knew not , thou wert made of Goodness , 'Twould breed a jealousie in me by what means , Thou cam'st by such a sum .
Were it ill got , I am sure it could not be employed so well , As to relieve your wants. Some noble friends , ( Rais 'd by heavens mercy to me , not my merits ) Bestow 'd it on me .
It were a sacriledgeTo rob thee of their bounty , since they gave itTo thy use only .
Buy thee brave Cloathes with itAnd fit thee for a fortune , and leave usTo our necessities ; why do'st thou weep ?
Out of my fear I have offended you ; For had I not , I am sure you are too kind , Not to accept the offer of my service , In which I am a gainer ; I have heardMy tutor say , of all aereal fowlThe Stork 's the Embleme of true pietie , Because when age hath seiz 'd upon her dam , And made unfit for flight , the gratefull young oneTakes her upon his back , provides her food , Repaying so her tender care of him , E 're he was fit to fly , by bearing her : Shall I then that have reason and discourseThat tell me all I can doe is too little , Be more unnatural than a silly bird ? Or feed or cloath my self superfluously , And know , nay see you want ? holy Saints keep me .
Can I be wretched , And know my self the Mother to such Goodness ?
Come let us drie our eyes , we 'll have a feast , Thanks to our little Steward .
And in him , Believe that we are rich .
I am sure I am , While I have power to comfort you , and serve you. [ Exeunt.SCENA III .
Henrique , and Violante .
Is it my fault , Don Henrique , or my fate ? What 's my offence ? I came young to your bed , I had a fruitfull Mother , and you met meWith equall ardour in your May of blood ; And why then am I barren ?
'T is not in ManTo yield a reason for the will of Heaven , Which is inscrutable .
To what use serveFull fortunes , and the meaner sort of blessings , When that , which is the Crown of all our wishes , The period of humane happiness , One only Child that may possess what 's ours , Is cruelly deni 'd us ?
'T is the curseOf great Estates to want those Pledges , whichThe poor are happy in : They in a Cottage , With joy , behold the Models of their youth , And as their Root decaies , those budding BranchesSprout forth and flourish , to renew their age ; But this is the beginning , not the endOf misery to me , that 'gainst my will ( Since Heaven denies us Issue of our own ) Must leave the fruit of all my care and travelTo an unthankfull Brother that insultsOn my Calamity .
I will rather chooseA Bastard from the Hospital and adopt him , And nourish him as mine own .
Such an evasion ( My Violante ) is forbid to us ; Happy the Romane State , where it was lawfull , ( If our own Sons were vicious ) to choose oneOut of a vertuous Stock , though of poor Parents , And make him noble. But the laws of Spain , ( Intending to preserve all ancient Houses ) Prevent such free elections ; with this , my Brother'sToo well acquainted , and this makes him bold toReign o 're me , as a Master .
I will fireThe Portion I brought with me , e 're he spendA Royal of it : no Quirck left ? no QuidditThat may defeat him ?
Were I but confirmed , That you would take the means I use with patience , As I must practise it with my dishonour , I could lay level with the earth his hopesThat soar above the clouds with expectationTo see me in my grave .
Effect but this , And our revenge shall be to us a SonThat shall inherit for us .
Do not repentWhen 't is too late .
I fear not what may fallHe dispossess 'd that does usurp on all. [ Exeunt .
Leandro , ( with a letter writ out ) Milanes , and Arsenio .
Can any thing but wonder ?
Wonder on , I am as ye see , and , what will follow , Gentlemen ?
Why dost thou put on this form ? what can this do ? Thou lookest most sillily .
Like a young Clerk , A half pin'd-puppy that would write for a Royal.Is this a commanding shape to win a beauty ? To what use , what occasion ?
Peace , ye are fools , More silly than my out-side seems , ye are ignorant ; They that pretend to wonders must weave cunningly .
What manner of access can this get ? or if gottenWhat credit in her eyes ?
Will ye but leave me ?
Me thinks a young man and a handsom Gentleman ( But sure thou art lunatick ) me thinks a brave manThat would catch cunningly the beams of beauty , And so distribute 'em unto his comfort , Should like himself appear , young , high , and buxom , And in the brightest form .
Ye are cozen 'd ( Gentlemen ) Neither do I believe this , nor will follow it , Thus as I am , I will begin my voyage.When you love , lanch it out in silks and velvets , I'le love in Serge , and will outgo your Sattins.To get upon my great horse and appearThe sign of such a man , and trot my measures , Or fiddle out whole frosty nights ( my friends ) Under the window , while my teeth keep tune , I hold no handsomness. Let me get in , There trot and fiddle where I may have fair play .
But how get in ?
Leave that to me , your patience , I have some toyes here that I dare well trust to : I have smelt a Vicar out , they call him Lopez.You are ne 're the nearer now .
We do confess it .
Weak simple men , this Vicar to this LawyerIs the most inward Damon .
What can this do ?
We know the fellow , and he dwells there .
So .
A poor , thin thief : he help ? he ? hang the Vicar , Can reading of an -- -- prefer thee ? Thou art dead-sick in love , and hee'l pray for thee .
Have patience ( Gentlemen ) I say this Vicar , This thing I say is all one with the Close Bartolus ( For so they call the Lawyer ) or his natureWhich I have studied by relation : And make no doubt I shall hit handsomly , Will I work cunningly , and home : understand me .
Lopez , and Diego.Next I pray leave me , leave me to my fortune
, that 's my Motto ( Gentlemen ) I'le win this Diamond from the rock and wear her , Or --
Peace , the Vicar : send ye a full sail , Sir .
There 's your Confessor , but what shall be your penance ?
A fools head if I fail , and so forsake me.You shall hear from me daily .
We will be ready. [ Exeunt Mil. Ars .
Thin world indeed !
I'le let him breath and mark him : No man would think a stranger as I amShould reap any great commodity from his pigbelly .
Poor stirring for poor Vicars .
And poor Sextons .
We pray and pray , but to no purpose , Those that enjoy our lands , choak our Devotions.Our poor thin stipends make us arrant dunces .
If you live miserably , how shall we do ( Master ) That are fed only with the sound of prayers ? We rise and ring the Bells to get good stomachs , And must be fain to eat the ropes with reverence .
When was there a Christning , Diego ?
Not this ten weeks : Alas , they have forgot to get children ( Master ) The Wars , the Seas , and usurie undoe us , Takes off our minds , our edges , blunts our plough-shares.They eat nothing here , but herbs , and get nothing but green sauce : There are some poor Labourers , that perhapsOnce in seven year , with helping one another , Produce some few pin'd-Butter-prints , that scarce holdThe christning neither .
Your Gallants , they get Honour , A strange fantastical Birth , to defraud the Vicar , And the Camp Christens their Issues , or the Curtizans , 'T is a lewd time .
They are so hard-hearted here too , They will not dye , there 's nothing got by Burials .
, the Air 's too pure , they can not perish.To have a thin Stipend , and an everlasting Parish , Lord what a torment 't is !
Good sensible Master , You are allow 'd to pray against all weathers , ( Both foul , and fair , as you shall find occasion ) Why not against all airs ?
That 's not i'th ' Canons.I would it had , 't is out of our way forty pence .
'T is strange , they are starv 'd too yet they will not die here , They will not earth : a good stout plague amongst 'em , Or half a dozen new fantastical FeversThat would turn up their heels by whole-sale ( Master ) And take the Doctors too , in their grave Counsels , That there might be no natural help for mony : How merrily would my Bells goe then ?
Peace Diego , The Doctors are our friends , let 's please them well.For though they kill but slow , they are certain , Diego , We must remove into a muddy Air , A most contagious Climate .
We must certain , An air that is the nursery of agues , Such agues ( Master ) that will shake mens souls out , Ne 're stay for Possets , nor good old wives plasters .
Gowts and dead Palsies .
The dead do 's well at all times , Yet Gowts will hang an arse a long time ( Master ) The Pox , or English Surfeits if we had 'em ; Those are rich marle , they make a Church-yard fat , And make the Sexton sing , they never miss , Sir .
Then Wills and Funeral Sermons come in season , And Feasts that make us frolick .
Would I could see 'em .
And though I weep i'th ' Pulpit for my Brother , Yet ( Diego ) here I laugh .
The cause requires it .
Since people left to die I am dunce , Diego .
'T is a strange thing , I have forgot to dig too .
A pretious pair of youths ! I must make toward'em .
Who 's that ? look it seems he would speak to us.I hope a Marriage , or some Will to make , Diego .
My friend your business ?
'T is to that grave Gentleman ; Bless your good learning , Sir .
And bless you also , He bears a promising face , there 's some hope toward .
I have a Letter to your worship .
Well Sir , From whence I pray you ?
From Nova Hispania , Sir , And from an ancient friend of yours .
'T is well , Sir , 'T is very well : the devil a-one I know there .
Take heed of a Snap , Sir , h'as a cozening countenancedo not like his way .
Let him goe forward .
, They that have nothing fear nothing , All I have to lose , Diego , is my learning , And when he has gotten that , he may put it in a Nut shell.LETTER READ .
Cordova to these parts , I have written divers Letters unto you , but as yet received noAnswer of any ( Good and very good ) And although so great aforgetfulness might cause a want in my due correspondence , yet thedesire I have still to serve you must more prevail with me ( Betterand better : the devil a man know I yet ) and therefore with thepresent occasion offered I am willing to crave a continuance of thefavours , which I have heretofore received from you , and do recommendmy Son Leandro the Bearer to you with request that he maybe admitted in that Universitie till such time as I shall arrive athome ; his studies he will make you acquainted withall ; This kindnessshall supply the want of your slackness : And so heaven keep you.YoursAlonzo Tiveria .
, very well , A very ancient friend of mine , I take it , For till this hour I never heard his name yet .
You look , Sir , as if ye had forgot my Father .
No , no , I look , as I would remember him , For that I never remembred , I can not forget , Sir,
?
The same , Sir .
And now i'th ' Indies ?
Yes .
He may be any where , For ought that I consider .
Think again , Sir , You were Students both at one time in Salamanca , And , as I take it , Chamber-fellows .
Ha ?
Nay , sure you must remember .
Would I could .
I have heard him say , you were Gossips too .
Very likely , You did not hear him say , to whom ? for we StudentsMay oft-times over-reach our memories.Do'st thou remember , Diego , this same Signiour ? Thou hast been mine these twenty years .
Remember ? Why this Fellow would make ye mad : Nova Hispania ? And Signiour Tiveria ? what are these ? He may as well name ye Friends out of Cataya.Take heed I beseech your worship : do you hear , ( my friend ? ) You have no Letters for me ?
Not any letter , But I was charged to doe my Fathers loveTo the old honest Sexton Diego : are you he , Sir ?
Ha ? have I friends , and know 'em not ? my name is Diego , But if either I remember you or your Father , Or Nova Hispania ( I was never there Sir ) Or any kindred that you have -- for heaven-sake , Master , Let 's cast about a little , and consider , We may dream out our time .
It seems I am deceiv 'd , Sir , Yet , that you are Don Lopez all men tell me , The Curate here , and have been some time , Sir , And you the Sexton Diego , such I am sent to , The letter tells as much : may be they are dead , And you of the like names succeed : I thank ye Gentlemen , Ye have done honestly , in telling truth , I might have been forward else. For to that Lopez , That was my Fathers friend , I had a charge , ( A charge of mony ) to deliver ( Gentlemen ) Five hundred Duckets , a poor small gratuity , But since you are not he --
Good Sir , let me think , I pray ye be patient , Pray ye stay a little , Nay , let me remember , I beseech ye stay , Sir .
An honest noble friend , that sends so lovingly ; An old friend too ; I shall remember sure , Sir .
Thou sayst true Diego .
'Pray ye consider quickly , Doe , doe , by any means , me thinks alreadyA grave staid gentleman comes to my memory .
He 's old indeed , sir .
With a goodly white Beard , ( For now he must be so : I know he must be )
, Master .
I begin to have him .
H'as been from hence , about some twenty years , sir .
Some five and twenty , sir .
You say most true , Sir , Just to an hour ; 't is now just five and twenty , A fine straight timber 'd man , and a brave soldier , He married : let me see , --
Daughter .
The very same .
Thou art a very Rascal.De Castro is the Turk to thee , or any thing : The Mony rubbs 'em into strange remembrances , For as many Duckets more they would remember Adam .
Give me your hand , you are welcome to your country , Now I remember plainly , manifestly , As freshly , as if yesterdy I had seen him , Most heartily welcome : sinfull that I am , Most sinfull man ! why should I lose this Gentleman ? This loving old Companion ? we had all one soul , sir , He dwelt here hard by , at a handsome --
Farm sir , You say most true .
! Lord , Lord that time should play the treacherous knave thus ! Why , he was the only friend I had in Spain , sir , I knew your Mother too , a handsome Gentlewoman , She was married very young : I married 'em : I do remember now the Maskes and Sports then , The Fire-works , and the fine delights ; good faith , sir , Now I look in your face , whose eyes are those , Diego ? Nay , if he be not just Alonzo 's picture --
Lord , how I blush for these two impudents !
Well Gentleman , I think your name 's Leandro .
It is indeed , sir , Gra'-mercy letter , thou hadst never known else .
I have dandled ye , and kist ye and plaid with yeA hundred , and a hundred times , and danc 'd ye , And swong ye in my Bell-ropes , ye lov 'd swinging .
A sweet Boy .
Sweet lying knaves.What would these doe for thousands ?
A wondrous sweet Boy then it was , see nowTime that consumes us , shoots him up still sweeter.How do 's the noble Gentleman ? how fares he ? When shall we see him ? when will he bless his Country ?
O , very shortly , Sir , till his returnHe has sent me over to your charge .
And welcome , Nay , you shall know you are welcome to your friend , sir .
And to my Study , Sir , which must be the Law.To further which , he would entreat your careTo plant me in the favour of some manThat 's expert in that knowledge : for his painsI have three hundred Duckets more : For my Diet , Enough , Sir , to defray me : which I am chargedTo take still , as I use it , from your custodie , I have the mony ready , and I am weary .
Sit down , sit down , and once more ye are most welcome , The Law you have hit upon most happily , Here is a Master in that art , Bartolus , A neighbour by , to him I will prefer ye , A learned man , and my most loving neighbour , I'le doe ye faithful service , Sir .
He 's an Ass , And so wee 'll use him ; he shall be a Lawyer .
But if ever he recover this mony again -- before , Diego , And get some pretty pittance : my Pupill 's hungry .
Pray ye Sir , unlade me .

Bartolus , and Amaranta .
My Amaranta , a retir 'd sweet life , Private and close , and still , and houswifely , Becomes a Wife , sets off the grace of woman.At home to be believ 'd both young , and handsome , As Lilies that are cas 'd in crystall Glasses , Makes up the wonder : shew it abroad 't is stale , And still the more eyes cheapen it 't is more slubber 'd , And what need windowes open to inviting ? Or evening Tarrasses , to take opinions ? When the most wholsome air ( my wife ) blows inward , When good thoughts are the noblest Companions , And old chast stories , wife , the best discourses ; But why do I talk thus , that know thy nature ?
You know your own disease : distrust , and jealousie , And those two , give these Lessons , not good meaning , What trial is there of my honestie , When I am mew 'd at home ? to what end Husband , Serves all the vertuous thoughts , and chast behavioursWithout their uses ? Then they are known most excellentWhen by their contraries they are set off , and burnish'd.If ye both hold me fair , and chast , and vertuous , Let me goe fearless out , and win that greatness : These seeds grow not in shades , and conceal 'd places : Set 'em i'th ' heat of all , then they rise glorious .
Peace , ye are too loud .
You are too covetous.If that be rank 'd a vertue , you have a rich one.Set me ( like other Lawyers wives ) off handsomely , Attended as I ought , and as they have it , My Coach , my people , and my handsome women , My will in honest things .
Peace Amaranta .
They have content , rich clothes , and that secures 'em , Binds , to their carefull husbands , their observance , They are merry , ride abroad , meet , laugh .
Thou shalt too .
And freely may converse with proper Gentlemen , Suffer temptations daily to their honour .

You are now too far again : thou shalt have any thing , Let me but lay up for a handsome Office , And then my Amaranta --
Here 's a thing now , Ye place as pleasure to me : all my retinue , My Chamber-maid , my Kitchin-maid , my friend , And what she fails in , I must doe my self.A foyle to set my Beauty off , I thank ye , You will place the Devil next for a Companion .
No more such words , good wife , What would you have , Maid ?

You had best to be jealous of the man you know not .
'Pray thee no more of that .

No , no , thou shalt not ; 't is some honest Client , Rich , and litigious , the Curate has brought to me , Pre'thee goe in ( my Duck ) I'le but speak to 'em , And return instantly .

Good-day , good Master Curate , And neighbour Diego , welcom : what 's your business ? And 'pray ye be short ( good friends ) the time is pretious , Welcom , good Sir .
To be short then with your Mastership , ( For I know your several hours are full of business ) We have brought ye this young-man , of honest parents , And of an honest face .
It seems so , Neighbours , But to what end ?
To be your Pupil , Sir , Your Servant , if you please .
I have travell 'd far , Sir , To seek a worthy man .
Alas , good Gentleman , I am a poor man , and a private too , Unfit to keep a Servant of your Reckoning ; My house a little Cottage , and scarce ableTo hold my self , and those poor few live under it ; Besides , you must not blame me Gentlemen , If I were able to receive a Servant , To be a little scrupulous of his dealing , For in these times --
'Pray let me answer that , sir , Here is five hundred Duckets , to secure him , He can not want , Sir , to make good his credit , Good gold , and coin .
And that 's an honest pledge ; Yet sure , that needs not , for his face , and carriage , Seem to declare an in-bred honesty .
And ( for I have a ripe mind to the Law , sir , In which I understand you live a Master ) The least poor corner in your house , poor Bed , sir , ( Let me not seem intruding to your worship ) With some Books to instruct me , and your counsel , Shall I rest most content with : other AcquaintanceThan your grave presence , and the grounds of LawI dare not covet , nor I will not seek , sir , For surely mine own nature desires privacy.Next , for your monthly pains ( to shew my thanks , ) I do proportion out some twenty Duckets ; As I grow riper , more : three hundred now , sir , To shew my love to learning , and my Master , My diet I'le defray too , without trouble .
Note but his mind to learning .
I do strangely , yes , and I like it too , thanks to his mony .
Would he would live with me , and learn to dig too .
A wondrous modest man , sir .
So it seems , His dear love to his Studie must be nourish 'd , Neighbour , he 's like to prove .
With your good counsel , And with your diligence , as you will ply him ; His Parents , when they know your care --
Come hither .
An honester young man , your worship ne 're kept , But he is so bashfull --
O I like him better.Say I should undertake ye , which indeed , sir , Will be no little straitness to my living , Considering my Affairs , and my small house , sir , For I see some promises that pull me to ye ; Could you content your self , at first thus meanly , To lie hard , in an out-part of my house , sir ? For I have not many Lodgings to allow ye ; And studie should be still remote from company ; A little fire sometimes too , to refresh ye ; A Student must be frugal : sometimes Lights too , According to your labour .
Any thing , Sir , That 's dry , and wholsome : I am no bred-wanton .
Then I receive you : but I must desire yeTo keep within your confines .
Ever Sir , There 's the Gold , and ever be your servant , Take it and give me Books : may I but prove , sir , According to my wish , and these shall multiply .
Do , study hard , pray ye take him in , and settle him , He 's only fit for you ; Shew him his Cell , sir .
Take a good heart ; and when ye are a cunning Lawyer , I'le sell my Bells , and you shall prove it lawfull .
Come , sir , with me : neighbours I thank your diligence .
I'le come sometimes , and crack a case with ye .

Here 's mony got with ease : here , spend that jovially , And pray for the fool , the Founder .
Many more foolsI heartily pray may follow his example , Lawyers , or Lubbers , or of what condition , And many such sweet friends in Nova Hispania .
It will do well ; let 'em but send their monys , Come from what quarter of the world , I care not , I'le know 'em instantly ; nay I'le be kin to 'em ; I can not miss a man , that sends me mony : Let him law there , long as his Duckets last , Boy , I'le grace him , and prefer him .
I'le turn Trade , Master , and now live by the living , Let the dead stink , 't is a poor stinking Trade .
If the young fool nowShould chance to chop upon his fair Wife , Diego ?
And handle her Case , Master , that 's a law point , A point would make him start , and put on his Spectacles , A hidden point , were worth the canvassing .
Now surely , surely , I should love him , Diego , And love him heartily : nay , I should love my self , Or any thing that had but that good fortune , For to say truth , the Lawyer is a dog-bolt , An arrant worm : and though I call him worshipfull , I wish him a canoniz 'd Cuckold , Diego , Now , if my youth do dub him --
He is too demure , Sir .
If he do sting her home .
There 's no such matter , The woman was not born to so much blessedness , He has no heat : study consumes his oyl , Master .
Let 's leave it to the will of Fate , and presentlyOver a cup of lustie Sack , let 's prophesie.I am like a man that dreamt he was an Emperour , Come Diego , hope , and whilst he lasts , we 'll lay it on. [ Ex.SCENA III .

He may be more beast .
Let him bear six , and six , that all may blaze him , The villany he has sowed into my Brother , And from his State , the Revenue he has reach 'd at : Pay him , my good Leandro , take my prayers .
And all our wishes plough with his fine white heifer .
Mark him ( my dear friend ) for a famous Cuckold , Let it out-live his Books , his pains , and hear me , The more he seeks to smother it with Justice,
Servant.Let it blaze out the more : what news Andrea ?
News I am loth to tell ye : but I am charg 'd , sir , Your Brother layes a strict command upon ye , No more to know his house , upon your danger , I am sorry , Sir .
Faith never be : I am glad o n't , He keeps the house of pride , and foolery : I mean to shun it : so return my Answer , 'Twill shortly spew him out ; Come , let 's be merry , And lay our heads together , carefullyHow we may help our friend ; and let 's lodge near him , Be still at hand : I would not for my patrimony , But he should crown his Lawyer , a learned Monster ; Come , let 's away , I am stark mad till I see him.

Why will ye bring men in , and yet be jealous ? Why will ye lodge a young man , a man able , And yet repine ?
He shall not trouble thee , sweet , A modest poor slight thing , did I not tell theeHe was only given to the Book , and for thatHow Royally he paies ? finds his own meat too .
I will not have him here : I know your courses , And what fits you will fall into of madness .
'Faith , I will not , Wife .
I will not try ye .
He comes not near thee : shall not dare to treadWithin thy Lodgings : in an old out-RoomWhere Logs , and Coles were laid .
Now ye lay fire ; fire to consume your quiet .
Didst thou know him , Thou wouldst think as I do : he disquiet thee ? Thou mayst wear him next thy heart , and yet not warm him.His mind ( poor man ) 's o'th ' Law , how to live after , And not on lewdness : on my ConscienceHe knows not how to look upon a WomanMore than by reading what Sex she is .
I do not like it , Sir .
Do'st thou not see ( Fool ) What presents he sends hourly in his gratefulness ? What delicate meats ?
You had best trust him at your Table , Do , and repent it , do .
If thou be'st willing , By my troth , I think he might come , he 's so modest , He never speaks : there 's part of that he gave me , He 'll eat but half a dozen bits , and rise immediately , Even as he eats , he studies : he 'll not disquiet thee , Do as thou pleasest , Wife .
What means this Wood-cock ? [ Knock within .
Retire , Sweet , there 's one knocks : come in , your business .

He keeps very close : Lord , how I long to see him ! A Lute strook handsomely , a voice too ; I'le hear that : These Verses are no Law , they sound too sweetly , Now I am more desirous. [ Leandro peeping .
'T is she certain .
What 's that that peeps ?
O admirable face !
Sure 't is the man .
I will go out a little .
He looks not like a fool , his face is noble : How still he stands !
I am strucken dumb with wonder , Sure all the Excellence of Earth dwells here .
How pale he looks ! yet , how his eyes like torches , Fling their beams round : how manly his face shews ! He comes on : surely he will speak : he is made most handsomly : This is no Clerk behaviour ; now I have seen ye , I'le take my time : Husband , ye have brought home tinder. [ Exit .
Sure she has transform 'd me , I had forgot my tongue clean , I never saw a face yet , but this rare one , But I was able boldly to encounter it , And speak my mind , my lips were lockt up here.This is divine , and only serv 'd with reverence ; O most fair cover of a hand far fairer , Thou blessed Innocence , that guards that whiteness , Live next my heart. I am glad I have got a relick , [ A noise within ] A relick when I pray to it , may work wonders.Hark , there 's some noise : I must retire again.This blessed Apparition makes me happy ; I'le suffer , and I'le sacrifice my substance , But I'le enjoy : now softly to my Kennel.

Henrique , and Bartolus .
You know my cause sufficiently ?
I do Sir .
And though it will impair my honesty , And strike deep at my Credit , yet , my Bartolus , There being no other evasion left to free meFrom the vexation of my spightful Brother , That most insultingly raigns over me , I must and will go forward .
Do , my Lord , And look not after credit , we shall cure that , Your bended honesty we shall set right , Sir , We Surgeons of the Law do desperate Cures , Sir , And you shall see how heartily I'le handle it : Mark how I'le knock it home : be of good chear , Sir , You give good Fees , and those beget good Causes , The Prerogative of your Crowns will carry the matter , ( Carry it sheer ) the Assistant sits to morrow , And he 's your friend , your monyed men love naturally , And as your loves are clear , so are your Causes .
He shall not want for that .
No , no , he must not , Line your Cause warmly , Sir , the times are Aguish , That holds a Plea in heart ; hang the penurious , Their Causes ( like their purses ) have poor Issues .
That way , I was ever bountiful .
'T is true , Sir , That makes ye fear 'd , forces the Snakes to kneel to ye , Live full of mony , and supply the Lawyer , And take your choice of what mans lands you please , Sir , What pleasures , or what profits ; what revenges , They are all your own : I must have witnessesEnough , and ready .
You shall not want , my Bartolus .
Substantial fearless souls , that will swear suddenly , That will swear any thing .
They shall swear truth too .
That 's no great matter : for varietyThey may swear truth , else 't is not much look 'd after : I will serve Process , presently , and strongly , Upon your Brother , and Octavio,
, and the Boy ; provide your proofs , Sir , And set 'em fairly off , be sure of Witnesses , Though they cost mony , want no store of witnesses , I have seen a handsome Cause so foully lost , Sir , So beastly cast away for want of Witnesses .
There shall want nothing .
Then be gone , be provident , Send to the Judge a secret way : you have me , And let him understand the heart .
I shall , Sir .
And feel the pulses strongly beat , I'le study , And at my hour , but mark me , go , be happy , Go and believe i'th ' Law .
I hope 'twill help me. [ Exeunt.SCENA II .

I have taught these twenty years , Preacht spoon-meat to ye , that a Child might swallow , Yet ye are Block-heads still : what should I say to ye ? Ye have neither faith , nor mony left to save ye , Am I a fit companion for such Beggers ? 1.If the Shepheard will suffer the sheep to be scab 'd , Sir --
No , no ye are rotten .
Would they were , for my sake .
I have Nointed ye , and Tarr 'd ye with my Doctrine , And yet the Murren sticks to ye , yet ye are Mangy , I will avoid ye.2.Pray ye , Sir , be not angry , In the pride of your new Cassock , do not part with us , We do acknowledge ye are a careful Curate , And one that seldom troubles us with Sermons , A short slice of a Reading serves us , Sir , We do acknowledge ye a quiet Teacher , Before you 'll vex your Audience , you 'll sleep with 'em , And that 's a loving thing.3.We grant ye , Sir , The only benefactor to our Bowling , To all our merry Sports the first provoker , And at our Feasts , we know there is no reason , But you that edifie us most , should eat most .
I will not stay for all this , ye shall know meA man born to a more beseeming fortuneThan ringing all-in , to a rout of Dunces.4.We will increase your Tithes , you shall have Eggs too , Though they may prove most dangerous to our Issues.1.I am a Smith ; yet thus far out of my love , You shall have the tenth Horse I prick , to pray for , I am sure I prick five hundred in a year , Sir.2.I am a Cook , a man of a dri 'd Conscience , Yet thus far I relent : you shall have tith Pottage.3.Your stipend shall be rais 'd too , good Neighbour Diego .
Would ye have me speak for ye ? I am more angry , Ten times more vex 'd , not to be pacified : No , there be other places for poor Sextons , Places of profit , Friends , fine stirring places , And people that know how to use our Offices , Know what they were made for : I speak for such Capons ? Ye shall find the Key o'th ' ChurchUnder the door , Neighbours , You may go in , and drive away the Dawes .
My Surpless , with one sleeve , you shall find there , For to that dearth of Linnen you have driven me ; And the old Cutwork Cope , that hangs by Geometry : 'Pray ye turn 'em carefully , they are very tender ; The remnant of the Books , lie where they did , Neighbours , Half puft away with the Church-wardens pipings , Such smoaky zeals they have against hard places.The Poor-mans Box is there too : if ye find any thingBeside the Posie , and that half rub 'd out too , For fear it should awake too much charity , Give it to pious uses , that is , spend it .
The Bell-ropes , they are strong enough to hang ye , So we bequeath ye to your destiny.1.'Pray ye be not so hasty .
I'le speak a proud word to ye , Would ye have us stay ?
We do most heartily pray ye .
I'le draw as mighty drink , Sir .
A strong motive , The stronger still , the more ye come unto me .
And I'le send for my Daughter .
This may stir too : The Maiden is of age , and must be edified .
You shall have any thing : lose our learned Vicar ? And our most constant friend ; honest dear Diego ?
Yet all this will not do : I'le tell ye , Neighbours , And tell ye true , if ye will have us stay , If you will have the comforts of our companies , You shall be bound to do us right in these points , You shall be bound , and this the obligation , Dye when 't is fit , that we may have fit duties , And do not seek to draw out our undoings , Marry try 'd Women , that are free , and fruitful , Get Children in abundance , for your Christnings , Or suffer to be got , 't is equal justice .
Let Weddings , Christnings , Churchings , Funerals , And merry Gossippings go round , go round still , Round as a Pig , that we may find the profit .
And let your old men fall sick handsomely , And dye immediately , their Sons may shoot up : Let Women dye o'th ' Sullens too , 't is natural , But be sure their Daughters be of age first , That they may stock us still : your queazie young WivesThat perish undeliver 'd , I am vext with , And vext abundantly , it much concerns me , There 's a Child 's Burial lost , look that be mended .
Let 'em be brought to Bed , then dye when they please.These things considered , Country-men , and sworn to.2.All these , and all our Sports again , and Gambols.3.We must dye , and we must live , and we 'll be merry , Every man shall be rich by one another.2.We are here to morrow and gone to day , for my partIf getting Children can befriend my Neighbours , I'le labour hard but I'le fill your Font , Sir.1.I have a Mother now , and an old Father , They are as sure your own , within these two months -- 4.My Sister must be pray 'd for too , she is desperate , Desperate in love .
Keep desperate men far from her , Then 'twill go hard : do you see how melancholy ? Do you mark the man ? do you profess ye love him ? And would do any thing to stay his fury ? And are ye unprovided to refresh him , To make him know your loves ? fie Neighbours.2.We 'll do any thing.We have brought Musick to appease his spirit , And the best Song we 'll give him .
'Pray ye sit down , Sir , They know their duties now , and they stand readyTo tender their best mirth .
'T is well , proceed Neighbours , I am glad I have brought ye to understand good manners , Ye had Puritan hearts a-while , spurn 'd at all pastimes , But I see some hope now .
We are set , proceed Neighbours.SONG.1Let the Bells ring , and let the Boys sing , The young Lasses skip and play , Let the Cups go round , till round goes the ground , Our Learned old Vicar will stay.2Let the Pig turn merrily , merrily ah , And let the fat Goose swim , For verily , verily , verily ah , Our Vicar this day shall be trim.3The stewed Cock shall Crow , Cock-a-loodle-loo , A loud Cock-a-loodle shall he Crow ; The Duck and the Drake , shall swim in a lakeOf Onions and Claret below.4Our Wives shall be neat , to bring in our meat ; To thee our most noble adviser , Our pains shall be great , and Bottles shall sweat , And we our selves will be wiser.5We 'll labour and swinck , we 'll kiss and we 'll drink , And Tithes shall come thicker and thicker ; We 'll fall to our Plow , and get Children enough , And thou shalt be learned old Vicar .

There 's no need o n't , Sir , We come to bring ye a Remembrance from a Merchant .

And if we do not handsomely endeavour --
Go home , and till ye hear more , keep private , Till we appear again , no words , Vicar , There 's something added .
For you too .
We are ready .
Go and expect us hourly , if ye falter , Though ye had twenty lives --

Octavio , Jacintha , and Ascanio .
We cited to the Court ! { A Bar , Table-book , 2 Chairs , and Paper , standish set out .
It is my wonder .
But not our fear , Jacintha ; wealthy men , That have Estates to lose ; whose conscious thoughtsAre full of inward guilt , may shake with horrourTo have their Actions sifted , or appearBefore the Judge. But we that know our selvesAs innocent , as poor , that have no FleeceOn which the Talons of the griping LawCan take sure hold , may smile with scorn on allThat can be urg 'd against us .
I am confidentThere is no man so covetous , that desiresTo ravish our wants from us , and less hopeThere can be so much Justice left on earth , ( T [ h ] ough sued , and call 'd upon ) to ease us ofThe burthen of our wrongs .
What thinks Ascanio ? Should we be call 'd in question , or accus'dUnjustly , what would you do to redeem usFrom tyrannous oppression ?
I could prayTo him that ever has an open ear , To hear the innocent , and right their wrongs ; Nay , by my troth , I think I could out-pleadAn Advocate , and sweat as much as heDo 's for a double Fee , ere you should sufferIn an honest cause .
Jamie and Bartolus .
Happy simplicitie !

And the Advocate , that caus 'd us to be summon 'd .

Peace , give them leave .
Serve me with Process ?
My Lord , you are not lawless .
Nor thou honest ; One , that not long since was the buckram Scribe , That would run on mens errands for an Asper , And from such baseness , having rais 'd a StockTo bribe the covetous Judge , call 'd to the Bar.So poor in practice too , that you would pleadA needy Clyents Cause , for a starv 'd Hen , Or half a little Loin of Veal , though fly-blown , And these , the greatest Fees you could arrive atFor just proceedings ; but since you turn 'd Rascal --
Good words , my Lord .
And grew my Brothers Bawd , In all his vitious courses , soothing himIn his dishonest practises , you are grownThe rich , and eminent Knave , in the Devils name , What am I cited for ?
You shall know anon , And then too late repent this bitter language , Or I 'll miss of my ends .
Were't not in Court , I would beat that fat of thine , rais 'd by the foodSnatch 'd from poor Clyents mouths , into a jelly : I would ( my man of Law ) but I am patient , And would obey the Judge .
'T is your best course : Would every enemy I have would beat me , I would wish no better Action .
'Save your Lordship .
My humble service .
My good Boy , how dost thou ? Why art thou call 'd into the Court ?
Assistant , Henrique , Officer , and Witnesses .
I know not , But 't is my Lord the Assistants pleasureI should attend here .
He will soon resolve us .
Make way there for the Judge .
How ? my kind Brother ? Nay then 't is rank : there is some villany towards .
This Sessions purchas 'd at your suit , Don Henrique , Hath brought us hither , to hear and determineOf what you can prefer .
I do beseechThe honourable Court , I may be heardIn my Advocate .
'T is granted .
Humh , humh .
That Preface , If left out in a Lawyer , spoils the Cause , Though ne 're so good , and honest .
If I stood here , To plead in the defence of an ill man , ( Most equal Judge ) or to accuse the innocent ( To both which , I profess my self a stranger ) It would be requisite I should deck my LanguageWith Tropes and Figures , and all flourishesThat grace a Rhetorician , 't is confess'dAdulterate Metals need the Gold-smiths Art , To set 'em off ; what in it self is perfectContemns a borrowed gloss : this Lord ( my Client ) Whose honest cause , when 't is related truly , Will challenge justice , finding in his ConscienceA tender scruple of a fault long sinceBy him committed , thinks it not sufficientTo be absolv 'd of't by his Confessor , If that in open Court he publish notWhat was so long conceal 'd .
To what tends this ?
In his young years ( it is no miracleThat youth , and heat of blood , should mix together ) He look 'd upon this woman , on whose faceThe ruines yet remain , of excellent form , He look 'd on her , and lov 'd her .
You good Angels , What an impudence is this ?
And us 'd all meansOf Service , Courtship , Presents , that might win herTo be at his devotion : but in vain ; Her Maiden Fort , impregnable held out , Until he promis 'd Marriage ; and beforeThese Witnesses a solemn Contract pass'dTo take her as his Wife .
Give them their Oath .
They are incompetent Witnesses , his own Creatures , And will swear any thing for half a Royal .
Silence .
Proceed .
Upon this strong assuranceHe did enjoy his wishes to the full , Which satisfied , and then with eyes of Judgement ( Hood-wink 'd with Lust before ) considering dulyThe inequality of the Match , he beingNobly descended , and allyed , but sheWithout a name , or Family , secretlyHe purchas 'd a Divorce , to disanulHis former Contract , Marrying openlyThe Lady Violante .
'T is strange : Give him an Oath .
I gladly swear , and truly .
After all this ( I say ) when I had bornThese wrongs , with Saint-like patience , saw anotherFreely enjoy , what was ( in Justice ) mine , Yet still so tender of thy rest and quiet , I never would divulge it , to disturbThy peace at home ; yet thou most barbarous , To be so careless of me , and my fame , ( For all respect of thine in the first stepTo thy base lust , was lost ) in open CourtTo publish my disgrace ? and on record , To write me up an easie-yielding wanton ? I think can find no precedent : In my extreams , One comfort yet is left , that though the LawDivorce me from thy bed , and made free wayTo the unjust embraces of another , It can not yet deny that this thy Son ( Look up Ascanio since it is come out ) Is thy legitimate heir .
Confederacie ! A trick ( my Lord ) to cheat me ; e 're you giveYour Sentence , grant me hearing .
New Chimera 's ?
I am ( my Lord ) since he is without Issue , Or hope of any , his undoubted heir , And this forg 'd by the Advocate , to defeat meOf what the laws of Spain confer upon me , A meer Imposture , and conspiracieAgainst my future fortunes .
You are too bold.Speak to the cause Don Henrique .
I confess , ( Though the acknowledgment must wound mine honour , ) That all the Court hath heard touching this Cause , ( Or with me , or against me ) is most true : The later part my Brother urg 'd , excepted : For what I now doe , is not out of Spleen ( As he pretends ) but from remorse of conscienceAnd to repair the wrong that I have doneTo this poor woman : And I beseech your LordshipTo think I have not so far lost my reason , To bring into my familie , to succeed me , The stranger -- Issue of anothers Bed , By proof , this is my Son , I challenge him , Accept him , and acknowledge him , and desireBy a definitive Sentence of the Court , He may be so recorded , and full powerTo me , to take him home .
A second rapeTo the poor remnant of content that 's left me , If this be granted : and all my former wrongsWere but beginnings to my miseries , But this the height of all : rather than partWith my Ascanio , I'le deny my oath , Profess my self a Strumpet , and endureWhat punishment soe 're the Court decreesAgainst a wretch that hath forsworn her self , Or plai 'd the impudent whore .
This tastes of passion , And that must not divert the course of Justice ;
, take your Son , with this conditionYou give him maintenance , as becomes his birth , And 'twill stand with your honour to doe somethingFor this wronged woman : I will compel nothing , But leave it to your will. Break up the Court : It is in vain to move me ; my doom 's pass 'd , And can not be revok'd. -- [ Exit .
There 's your reward .
More causes , and such Fees. Now to my Wife , I have too long been absent : Health to your Lordship. [ Exit .
You all look strangely , and I fear believeThis unexpected fortune makes me proud , Indeed it do 's not : I shall ever pay youThe duty of a son , and honour youNext to my Father : good my Lord , for yetI dare not call you , uncle , be not sad , I never shall forget those noble favoursYou did me being a stranger , and if everI live to be the master of a fortune , You shall command it .
Since it was determin'dI should be cozen 'd , I am glad the profitShall fall on thee , I am too tough to melt , But something I will do .

Very well , mock on , It is your turn : I may have mine -- [ Exit .

Do not fear it , I every day will see you : every hourRemember you in my prayers .

As I past by his chamber I might see him , But he is so bookish .
And so bashfull too , I ' faith he is , before he will speak , he will starve there .

This is no Lawyers language : I pray ye tell me , Whither may I remove , Ye see I am set round , To avoid my husband ?
I shall tell ye happily , But happily you will not be instructed .
Yes , and thank ye too , shall I move this man ?
Those are unseemly : move one can serve ye , Can honour ye , can love ye .

I'le tell ye instantly , Move me , and I will move any way to serve ye , Move your heart this way , Lady .
How ?
'Pray ye hear me.Behold the sport of love , when he is imperious , Behold the slave of love .
Move my Queen this way ? Sure , he 's some worthy man : then if he hedge me , Or here to open him .
Do but behold me , If there be pity in you , do but view me , But view the misery I have undertakenFor you , the povertie .

I'le seise your fair hand , And warm it with a hundred , hundred kisses.The God of love warm your desires but equal , That shall play my game now .
What do you mean Sir ? Why do you stop me ?
That ye may intend me.The time has blest us both : love bids us use it.I am a Gentleman nobly descended , Young to invite your love , rich to maintain it.I bring a whole heart to ye , thus I give it , And to those burning altars thus I offer , And thus , divine lips , where perpetual Spring grows --

I am wretched : Opened , discovered , lost to my wishes.I shall be whooted at .
What noise was this , wife ? Why dost thou smile ?
This proud thing will betray me .
Why these lie here ? what angry , dear ?
No , Sir , Only a chance , your pupil said he plaid well , And so indeed he do 's : he undertook for ye , Because I would not sit so long time idle , I made my liberty , avoided your mate , And he again as cunningly endangered me , Indeed he put me strangely to it. When presentlyHearing you come , & having broke his ambush too , Having the second time brought off my Queen fair , I rose o'th ' sudden smilingly to shew ye , My apron caught the Chesse-board , and the men , And there the noise was .
Thou art grown a Master , For all this I shall beat ye .
Or I , Lawyer , For now I love her more , 't was a neat answer , And by it hangs a mighty hope , I thank her , She gave my pate a sound knock that it rings yet , But you shall have a sounder if I live lawyer , My heart akes yet , I would not be in that fear --
I am glad ye are a gamester , Sir , sometimesFor recreation we two shall fight hard at it .
He will prove too hard for me .
I hope he shall do , But your Chess-board is too hard for my head , line that , good Lady .
I have been attoning two most wrangling neighbours , They had no mony , therefore I made even.Come , let 's go in and eat , truly I am hungry .
I have eaten already , I must intreat your pardon .
Do as ye please , we shall expect ye at supper.He has got a little heart , now it seems handsomly .

Hear but my reasons .
O my patience , hear 'em ! Can cunning falshood colour an excuseWith any seeming shape of borrowed truth ? Extenuate this wofull wrong , not error ?
You gave consent that , to defeat my brotherI should take any course .
But not to makeThe cure more loathsom than the foul disease : Was't not enough you took me to your bed , Tir 'd with loose dalliance , and with emptie veins , All those abilities spent before and wasted , That could confer the name of mother on me ? But that ( to perfect my account of sorrowFor my long barr [ en ] ness ) you must heighten itBy shewing to my face , that you were fruitfullHug 'd in the base embraces of another ? If Solitude that dwelt beneath my roof , And want of children was a torment to me , What end of my vexation to beholdA bastard to upbraid me with my wants ? And hear the name of father paid to ye , Yet know my self no mother , What can I say ?
Shall I confess my fault and ask your pardon ? Will that content ye ?
If it could make void , What is confirm 'd in Court : no , no , Don Henrique , You shall know that I find my self abus 'd , And adde to that , I have a womans anger , And while I look upon this Basilisk , Whose envious eyes have blasted all my comfortsRest confident I'le study my dark ends , And not your pleasures .
Noble Lady , hear me , Not as my Fathers son , but as your servant , Vouchsafe to hear me , for such in my duty , I ever will appear : and far be it fromMy poor ambition , ever to look on you , But with that reverence , which a slave stands boundTo pay a worthy Mistris : I have heardThat Dames of highest place , nay Queens themselvesDisdain not to be serv 'd by such as areOf meanest Birth : and I shall be most happie , To be emploi 'd when you please to command meEven in the coursest office , as your Page , I can wait on your trencher , fill your wine , Carry your pantofles , and be sometimes bless'dIn all humilitie to touch your feet : Or if that you esteem that too much grace , I can run by your Coach : observe your looks , And hope to gain a fortune by my service , With your good favour , which now , as a Son , I dare not challenge .
As a Son ?
Forgive me , I will forget the name , let it be deathFor me to call you Mother .
Still upbraided ?
No way left to appease you ?
Hear what I vow before the face of Heaven , And if I break it , all plagues in this life , And those that after death are fear 'd fall , on me , While that this Bastard staies under my roof , Look for no peace at home , for I renounceAll Offices of a wife .
What am I faln to ?
I will not eat , nor sleep with you , and those hours , Which I should spend in prayers for your health , Shall be emploi 'd in Curses .
Terrible .
All the day long , I'le be as tedious to youAs lingring fevers , and I'le watch the nights , To ring aloud your shame , and break your sleeps.Or if you do but slumber , I'le appearIn the shape of all my wrongs , and like a furyFright you to madness , and if all this failTo work out my revenge , I have friends and kinsmen , That will not sit down tame with the disgraceThat 's offer 'd to our noble familieIn what I suffer .
How am I dividedBetween the duties I owe as a Husband , And pietie of a Parent ?
I am taught SirBy the instinct of nature that obedienceWhich bids me to prefer your peace of mind , Before those pleasures that are dearest to me , Be wholly hers ( my Lord ) I quit all parts , That I may challenge : may you grow old together , And no distaste e 're find you , and beforeThe Characters of age are printed on youMay you see many Images of your selves , Though I , like some false glass , that 's never look 'd in , Am cast aside , and broken ; from this hour ( Unless invited , which I dare not hope for ) I never will set my forbidden feetOver your threshold : only give me leaveThough cast off to the world to mention youIn my devotions , 't is all I sue forAnd so I take my last leave .
Though I amDevoted to a wife , nay almost soldA slave to serve her pleasures , yet I cannotSo part with all humanity , but I mustShew something of a Father : thou shalt not goeUnfurnish 'd and unfriended too : take thatTo guard thee from necessities ; may thy goodnessMeet many favours , and thine innocenceDeserve to be the heir of greater fortunes , Than thou wer't born to. Scorn me not Violante , This banishment is a kind of civil death , And now , as it were at his funeralTo shed a tear or two , is not unmanly , And so farewel for ever : one word more , Though I must never see thee ( my Ascanio ) When this is spent ( for so the Judge decreed ) Send to me for supply : are you pleas 'd now ?
At the parting of my torment , and your shame.'Tis well : proceed : supply his wants : doe doe : Let the great dower I brought serve to maintainYour Bastards riots : send my Clothes and Jewels , To your old acquaintance , your dear dame his Mother.Now you begin to melt , I know 'twill follow .
Is all I doe misconstru 'd ?
I will takeA course to right my self , a speeding one : By the bless 'd Saints , I will ; if I prove cruel , The shame to see thy foolish pity , taught meTo lose my natural softness , keep off from me , Thy flatteries are infectious , and I'le flee theeAs I would doe a Leper .
Let not furyTransport you so : you know I am your Creature , All love , but to your self , with him , hath left me.I'le joyn with you in any thing .
In vain , I'le take mine own waies , and will have no partners .
I will not cross you .
Do not , they shall findThat to a Woman of her hopes beguil'dA Viper trod on , or an Aspick 's mild. [ Exeunt.SCENA II .
Lopez , Milanes , Arsenio .
Sits the game there ? I have you by mine order , I love Leandro for't .
But you must shew itIn lending him your help , to gain him meansAnd opportunity .
He shall want nothing , I know my Advocate to a hair , and whatWill fetch him from his Prayers , if he use any , I am honyed with the project : I would have him horn'dFor a most precious Beast .
But you lose time .
I am gone , instruct you Diego , you will find himA sharp and subtle Knave , give him but hintsAnd he will amplifie. See all things ready , I'le fetch him with a vengeance -- [ Exit .
If he fail now , We 'll give him over too .
Tush , he is flesh'd.And knows what vein to strike for his own credit .
All things are ready .
Then we shall have a merry Scene , ne 're fear it. [ Exeunt.SCENA III .
Amaranta , with a note , and Moor .
Is thy Master gone out ?
Even now , the Curate fetch 'd him , About a serious business as it seem 'd , For he snatch 'd up his Cloak , and brush 'd his Hat straight , Set his Band handsomely , and out he gallop 'd .
'T is well , 't is very well , he went out , Egla , As luckily , as one would say , go Husband , He was call 'd by providence : fling this short PaperInto Leandro 's Cell , and waken him , He is monstrous vexed , and musty , at my Chess-play ; But this shall supple him , when he has read it : Take your own Recreation for two hours , And hinder nothing .
If I do , I 'll hang for't. [ Exeunt.SCENA IV .
Octavio , Jacintha .
If that you lov 'd Ascanio for himself , And not your private ends , you rather shouldBless the fair opportunity , that restores himTo his Birth-right , and the Honours he was born to , Than grieve at his good Fortune .
Grieve , Octavio ? I would resign my Essence , that he wereAs happy as my love could fashion him , Though every blessing that should fall on him , Might prove a curse to me : my sorrow springsOut of my fear and doubt he is not safe.I am acquainted with Don Henrique 's nature , And I have heard too much the fiery temperOf Madam Violante : can you thinkThat she , that almost is at war with HeavenFor being barren , will with equal eyesBehold a Son of mine ?
His Father 's care , That for the want of Issue , took him home , ( Though with the forfeiture of his own fame ) Will look unto his safety .
Step-mothersHave many eyes , to find a way to mischief , Though blind to goodness .
Jamie and Ascanio .
Here comes Don Jamie , And with him our Ascanio .
Good youth leave me , I know thou art forbid my company , And only to be seen with me , will call onThy Fathers anger. [ Asc. ] Sir , if that to serve youCould lose me any thing ( as indeed it can not ) I still would follow you. Alas I was bornTo do you hurt , but not to help my self , I was , for some particular end , took home , But am cast off again .
Is't possible ?
The Lady , whom my Father calls his Wife , Abhors my sight , is sick of me , and forc 'd himTo turn me out of doors .
By my best hopesI thank her cruelty , for it comes nearA saving Charity .
I am only happyThat yet I can relieve you , 'pray you share : My Father 's wondrous kind , and promisesThat I should be supplied : but sure the LadyIs a malicious Woman , and I fearMeans me no good .
Servant .
I am turn 'd a stone with wonder , And know not what to think .
From my Lady , Your private ear , and this --
New Miracles ?
She says , if you dare make your self a Fortune , She will propose the means ; my Lord Don HenriqueIs now from home , and she alone expects you , If you dare trust her , so , if not despair ofA second offer. [ Exit .
Though there were an AmbushLaid for my life , I'le on and sound this secret.Retire thee , my Ascanio , with thy Mother : But stir not forth , some great design 's on foot , Fall what can fall , if e 're the Sun be setI see you not , give me for dead .
We will expect you , And those bless 'd Angels , that love goodness , guard you. [ Exeunt.SCENA V .
Lopez and Bartolus .
Is't possible he should be rich ?
Most possible , He hath been long , though he had but little gettings , Drawing together , Sir .
Accounted a poor Sexton , Honest poor Diego .
I assure ye , a close Fellow , Both close , and scraping , and that fills the Bags , Sir .
A notable good fellow too ?
Sometimes , Sir , When he hop 'd to drink a man into a Surfeit , That he might gain by his Grave .
So many thousands ?
Heaven knows what .
'T is strange , 'T is very strange ; but we see by endeavour , And honest labour --
, by continuanceGrew from a silly Calf ( with your worships reverence ) To carry a Bull , from a penny , to a pound , Sir , And from a pound , to many : 't is the progress .
Ye say true , but he lov 'd to feed well also , And that me-thinks --
From another mans Trencher , Sir , And there he found it season 'd with small charge : There he would play the Tyrant , and would devour yeMore than the Graves he made ; at home he liv'dLike a Camelion , suckt th ' Air of misery , [ Table out , Standish , Paper , Stools.And grew fat by the Brewis of an Egg-shell , Would smell a Cooks-shop , and go home and surfeit.And be a month in fasting out that Fever .
These are good Symptoms : do 's he lye so sick say ye ?
Oh , very sick .
And chosen me Executor ?
Only your Worship .
No hope of his amendment ?
None , that we find .
He hath no Kinsmen neither ?
'Truth , very few,
His mind will be the quieter.What Doctors has he ?
There 's none , Sir , he believes in .
They are but needless things , in such extremities.Who draws the good mans Will ?
Marry that do I , Sir , And to my grief .
Grief will do little now , Sir , Draw it to your comfort , Friend , and as I counsel ye , An honest man , but such men live not always : Who are about him ?
Many , now he is passing , That would pretend to his love , yes , and some GentlemenThat would fain counsel him , and be of his Kindred ; Rich men can want no Heirs , Sir .
They do ill , Indeed they do , to trouble him ; very ill , Sir.But we shall take a care .
Diego , in a Bed , Milanes , Arsenio , and Parishioners .
Will ye come near , Sir ? 'Pray ye bring him out ; now ye may see in what state : Give him fresh Air .
I am sorry , Neighbour Diego , To find ye in so weak a state .
Ye are welcome , But I am fleeting , Sir .
Me-thinks he looks well , His colour fresh , and strong , his eyes are chearful .
A glimmering before death , 't is nothing else , Sir , Do you see how he fumbles with the Sheet ? do ye note that ?
My learned Sir , 'pray ye sit : I am bold to send for ye , To take a care of what I leave .
Do ye hear that ?
Play the Knave finely .
So I will , I warrant ye , And carefully .
'Pray ye do not trouble him , You see he 's weak and has a wandring fancy .
My honest Neighbours , weep not , I must leave ye , I can not always bear ye company , We must drop still , there is no remedy : 'Pray ye Master Curate , will ye write my Testament , And write it largely it may be remembred , And be witness to my Legacies , good Gentlemen ; Your Worship I do make my full Executor , You are a man of wit and understanding : Give me a cup of Wine to raise my Spirits , For I speak low : I would before these NeighboursHave ye to swear , Sir , that you will see it executed , And what I give let equally be rendredFor my souls health .
I vow it truly , Neighbours , Let not that trouble ye , before all these , Once more I give my Oath .
Then set me higher , And pray ye come near me all .
We are ready for ye .
Now spur the Ass , and get our friend time .
First then , After I have given my body to the worms , ( For they must be serv 'd first , they are seldom cozen 'd . )
Remember your Parish , Neighbour .
You speak truly , I do remember it , a lewd vile Parish , And pray it may be mended : To the poor of it , ( Which is to all the Parish ) I give nothing , For nothing , unto nothing , is most natural , Yet leave as much space , as will build an Hospital , Their Children may pray for me .
What do you give to it ?
Set down two thousand Duckets .
'T is a good gift , And will be long remembred .
To your worship , ( Because you must take pains to see all finish 'd ) I give two thousand more , it may be three , Sir , A poor gratuity for your pains-taking .
These are large sums .
Nothing to him that has 'em .
To my old Master Vicar , I give five hundred , ( Five hundred and five hundred are too few , Sir ) But there be more to serve .
This fellow coins sure .
Give me some more drink. Pray ye buy Books , buy Books , You have a learned head , stuff it with Libraries , And understand 'em , when ye have done , 't is Justice.Run not the Parish mad with Controversies , Nor preach Abstinence to longing Women , 'Twill burge the bottoms of their Consciences : I would give the Church new Organs , but I prophesieThe Church-wardens would quickly pipe 'em out o'th ' Parish , Two hundred Duckets more to mend the Chancel , And to paint true Orthographie , as many , They write Sunt with a C , which is abominable , 'Pray you set that down ; to poor Maidens Marriages .
I that 's well thought of , what 's your will in that point ? A meritorious thing .
No end of this Will ?
I give per annum two hundred Ells of Lockram , That there be no strait dealings in their Linnens , But the Sails cut according to their Burthens.To all Bell-ringers , I bequeath new Ropes , And let them use 'em at their own discretions .
You may remember us .
I do good Gentlemen , And I bequeath you both good careful Surgions , A Legacy , you have need of , more than mony , I know you want good Diets , and good Lotions , And in your pleasures , good take heed .
He raves now , But 'twill be quickly off .
I do bequeath yeCommodities of Pins , Brown-papers , Pack-threads , Rost Pork , and Puddings , Ginger-bread , and Jews-trumps , Of penny Pipes , and mouldy Pepper , take 'em , Take 'em even where you please and be cozen 'd with 'em , I should bequeath ye Executions also , But those I'le leave to th ' Law .
Now he grows temperate .
You will give no more ?
I am loth to give more from ye , Because I know you will have a care to execute.Only , to pious uses , Sir , a little .
If he be worth all these , I am made for ever .
I give to fatal Dames , that spin mens threads out , And poor distressed Damsels , that are militantAs members of our own Afflictions , A hundred Crowns to buy warm Tubs to work in , I give five hundred pounds to buy a Church-yard , A spacious Church-yard , to lay Thieves and Knaves in , Rich men and honest men take all the room up .
Are ye not weary ?
Never of well-doing .
These are mad Legacies .
They were got as madly ; My Sheep , and Oxen , and my moveables , My Plate , and Jewels , and five hundred Acres ; I have no heirs .
This can not be , 't is monstrous .
Three Ships at Sea too .
You have made me full Executor ?
Full , full , and total , would I had more to give ye , But these may serve an honest mind .
Ye say true , A very honest mind , and make it rich too ; Rich , wondrous rich , but where shall I raise these moneys , About your house ? I see no such great promises ; Where shall I find these sums ?
Even where you please , Sir , You are wise and provident , and know business , Ev'n raise 'em where you shall think good , I am reasonable .
Think good ? will that raise thousands ? What do you make me ?
You have sworn to see it done , that 's all my comfort .
Where I please ? this is pack 'd sure to disgrace me .
Ye are just , and honest , and I know you will do it , Ev'n where you please , for you know where the wealth is .
I am abused , betrayed , I am laugh 'd at , scorn 'd , Baffl 'd , and boared , it seems .
No , no , ye are fooled .
Most finely fooled , and handsomely , and neatly , Such cunning Masters must be fool 'd sometimes , Sir , And have their Worships noses wiped , 't is healthful , We are but quit : you fool us of our moneysIn every Cause , in every Quiddit wipe us .
Ha , ha , ha , ha , some more drink , for my heart , Gentlemen.This merry Lawyer -- ha , ha , ha , ha , this Scholar -- I think this fit will cure me : this Executor -- I shall laugh out my Lungs .
This is derision above sufferance , villanyPlotted and set against me .
Faith 't is Knavery , In troth I must confess , thou art fool 'd indeed , Lawyer .
Did you think , had this man been rich --
'T is well , Sir .
He would have chosen such a Wolf , a Canker , A Maggot-pate , to be his whole Executor ?
A Lawyer , that entangles all mens honesties , And lives like a Spider in a Cobweb lurking , And catching at all Flies , that pass his pit-falls ? Puts powder to all States , to make 'em caper ? Would he trust you ? Do you deserve ?
I find , Gentlemen , This Cataplasm of a well cozen 'd LawyerLaid to my stomach , lenifies my Feaver , Methinks I could eat now , and walk a little .
I am asham 'd to feel how flat I am cheated , How grossly , and maliciously made a May-game , A damned trick ; my Wife , my Wife , some Rascal : My Credit , and my Wife , some lustful Villain , Some Bawd , some Rogue .
Some crafty Fool has found ye : This 't is , Sir , to teach ye to be too busie , To covet all the gains , and all the rumours , To have a stirring Oare in all mens actions .
We did this , but to vex your fine officiousness .
Good yield ye , and good thank ye : I am fooled , Gentlemen ; The Lawyer is an Ass , I do confess it , A weak dull shallow Ass : good even to your Worships : Vicar , remember Vicar , Rascal , remember , Thou notable rich Rascal .
I do remember , Sir , 'Pray ye stay a little , I have ev'n two LegaciesTo make your mouth up , Sir .
Remember Varlets , Quake and remember , Rogues ; I have brine for your Buttocks. [ Exit .
Oh how he frets , and fumes now like a Dunghil !
His gall contains fine stuff now to make poysons , Rare damned stuff .
Let 's after him , and still vex him , And take my Friend off : by this time he has prosper 'd , He can not lose this dear time : 't is impossible .
Well Diego , thou hast done .
Hast done it daintily .
And shalt be as well paid , Boy --
Go , let 's crucifie him. [ Exeunt.SCENA VI .
Amaranta , Leandro .
I have told ye all my story , and how desperately .
I do believe : let 's walk on , time is pretious , Not to be spent in words , here no more wooing , The open Air 's an enemy to Lovers , Do as I tell ye .
I'le do any thing , I am so over- [ joy 'd ] , I'le fly to serve ye .
Take your joy moderately , as it is ministred , And as the cause invites : that man 's a foolThat at the sight o'th ' Bond , dances and leaps , Then is the true joy , when the mony comes .
You can not now deny me .
Nay , you know not , Women have crotchets , and strange fits .
You shall not .
Hold ye to that and swear it confidently , Then I shall make a scruple to deny ye : 'Pray ye let 's step in , and see a friend of mine , The weather 's sharp : we 'll stay but half an hour , We may be miss 'd else : a private fine house 't is , Sir , And we may find many good welcomes .

All your mind 's of doing , You must be modester .
I will be any thing. [ Exeunt.SCENA VII .

Open the doors , and give me room to chafe inMine own room , and my liberty : why Maid there , Open I say , and do not anger me , I am subject to much fury : when , ye Dish-clout ? When do ye come ? asleep ye lazie Hell-hound ? Nothing intended , but your ease , and eating ? No body here ? why Wife , why Wife ? why Jewel ? No tongue to answer me ? pre'thee , good Pupil , Dispense a little with thy careful study , And step to th ' door , and let me in ; nor he neither ? Ha ! not at 's study ? nor asleep ? nor no body ? I'le make ye hear : the house of ignorance , No sound inhabits here : I have a Key yetThat commands all : I fear I am Metamorphiz 'd .
Lopez , Arsenio , Milanes , Diego .
He keeps his fury still , and may do mischief .
He shall be hang 'd first , we 'll be sticklers there , boys .
The hundred thousand Dreams now , that possess himOf jealousie , and of revenge , and frailtie , Of drawing Bills against us , and Petitions .
And casting what his credit shall recover .
Let him cast till his Maw come up , we care not.You shall be still secured. [ A great noise within .
We 'll pay him home then ; Hark what a noise he keeps within !
CertainH'as set his Chimneys o ' fire , or the Devil roars there .
The Codixes o'th ' Law are broke loose , Gentlemen .
He 's fighting sure .
I'le tell ye that immediately -- [ Exit .
Or doing some strange out-rage on himself .
Hang him , he dares not be so valiant .
Diego .
There 's no body at home , and he chafes like a Lyon , And stinks withal. [ Noise still .
No body ?
Not a Creature , Nothing within , but he and his Law-tempest , The Ladles , Dishes , Kettles , how they flie all ! And how the Glasses through the Rooms !
Bartolus .
My friend sureHas got her out , and now he has made an end o n't .
See where the Sea comes ? how it foams , and brustles ? The great Leviathan o'th ' Law , how it tumbles ?
Made every way an Ass ? abus 'd on all sides ? And from all quarters , people come to laugh at me ? Rise like a Comet , to be wonder 'd at ? A horrid Comet , for Boys tongues , and Ballads ? I will run from my wits .
Amaranta , Leandro .
Do , do , good Lawyer , And from thy mony too , then thou wilt be quiet .
Here she comes home : now mark the salutations ; How like an Ass my friend goes ?
She has pull 'd his ears down .
Now , what sweet voyage ? to what Garden , Lady ? Or to what Cousins house ?
Is this my welcome ? I can not go to Church , but thus I am scandal 'd , Use no devotion for my soul , but Gentlemen --
To Church ?
Yes , and ye keep sweet youths to wait upon me , Sweet bred-up youths , to be a credit to me.There 's your delight again , pray take him to ye , He never comes near me more to debase me .
How 's this ? how 's this ? good wife , how , has he wrong 'd ye ?
I was fain to drive him like a sheep before me , I blush to think how people fleer 'd , and scorn 'd me.Others have handsome men , that know behaviour , Place , and observance : this silly thing knows nothing , Can not tell ten ; let every Rascal justle me , And still I push 'd him on as he had been coming .
Ha ! did ye push him on ? is he so stupid ?
When others were attentive to the Priest , Good devout Gentleman , then fell he fast , Fast , sound asleep : then first began the Bag-pipes , The several stops on 's nose made a rare musick , A rare and loud , and those plaid many an Anthem.Put out of that , he fell straight into dreaming .
As cunning , as she is sweet ; I like this carriage .
What did he then ?
Why then he talked in his Sleep too , Nay , I'le divulge your moral vertues ( sheeps-face ) And talk 'd aloud , that every ear was fixt to him : Did not I suffer ( do you think ) in this time ? Talk of your bawling Law , of appellationsOf Declarations , and Excommunications : Warrants , and Executions : and such DevilsThat drove all the Gentlemen out o'th ' Church , by hurryes , With execrable oaths , they would never come there again.Thus am I served and man 'd .
I pray ye forgive me , I must confess I am not fit to wait upon ye : Alas , I was brought up --
To be an Asse , A Lawyers Asse , to carry Books , and Buckrams .
But what did you at Church ?
At Church , did you ask her ? Do you hear Gentlemen , do you mark that question ? Because you are half an Heretick your self , Sir , Would ye breed her too ? this shall to the Inquisition , A pious Gentlewoman reproved for praying ? I'le see this filed , and you shall hear further , Sir .
Ye have an ill heart .
It shall be found out , Gentlemen , There be those youths will search it .
You are warm Signiour , But a Faggot will warm ye better : we are witnesses .
Enough to hang him , do not doubt .
Nay certain , I do believe h'as rather no Religion .
That must be known too , because she goes to Church , Sir ?
Let him go on , Sir , His wealth will build a Nunnery , a fair one , And this good Lady , when he is hang 'd and rotten , May there be Abbess .
You are cozen 'd , honest Gentlemen , I do not forbid the use but the form , mark me .
Form ? what do you make of form ?
They will undo me , Swear , as I oft have done , and so betray me ; I must make fair way , and hereafter , Wife , You are welcome home , and henceforth take your pleasure , Go when ye shall think fit , I will not hinder ye , My eyes are open now , and I see my errour , My shame , as great as that , but I must hide it.The whole conveyance now I smell , but Basta , Another time must serve : you see us friends , nowHeartily friends , and no more chiding , Gentlemen , I have been too foolish , I confess , no more words , No more , sweet Wife .
You know my easie nature .
Go get ye in : you see she has been angry : Forbear her sight a while and time will pacify ; And learn to be more bold .
I would I could , I will do all I am able. [ Exit .
Do Leandro , We will not part , but friends of all hands .
Well said , Now ye are reasonable , we can look on ye .
Ye have jerkt me : but for all that I forgive ye , Forgive ye heartily , and do invite yeTo morrow to a Breakfast , I make but seldom , But now we will be merry .
Now ye are friendly , Your doggedness and niggardize flung from ye.And now we will come to ye .
Give me your hands , all ; You shall be welcome heartily .
We will be , For we 'll eat hard .
The harder , the more welcome , And till the morning farewell ; I have business. [ Exit .
Farewel good bountiful Bartolus , 't is a brave wench , A suddain witty thief , and worth all service : Go we 'll all go , and crucifie the Lawyer .
I'le clap four tire of teeth into my mouth moreBut I will grind his substance .
Well Leandro , Thou hast had a strange Voyage , but I hopeThou rid'st now in safe harbour .
Let 's go drink , Friends , And laugh aloud at all our merry may-games .
A match , a match , 'twill whet our stomachs better. [ Exeunt .
Violante and Servant .
Madam , he 's come. [ Chair and stools out .
'T is well , how did he look , When he knew from whom you were sent ? was he not startled ? Or confident ? or fearful ?
As appear'dLike one that knew his fortune at the worst , And car 'd not what could follow .
'T is the better , Reach me a Chair : so , bring him in , be carefulThat none disturb us : I will try his temper , And if I find him apt for my employments,
Jamie , Servant.I'le work him to my ends ; if not , I shallFind other Engines .
There 's my Lady .
Leave us .
You sent for me ?
I did , and do 's the favour , Your present state considered and my power , Deserve no greater Ceremony ?
Ceremonie ? I use to pay that where I owe a duty , Not to my Brothers wife : I can not fawn , If you expect it from me , you are cozen 'd , And so farewel .
He bears up still ; I like it.Pray you a word .
Yes , I will give you hearingOn equal terms , and sit by you as a friend , But not stand as a Sutor : Now your pleasure ?
You are very bold .
'T is fit : since you are proud , I was not made to feed that foolish humour , With flattery and observance .
Yet , with your favour , A little form joyn 'd with respect to her , That can add to your wants , or free you from 'em ( Nay raise you to a fate , beyond your hopes ) Might well become your wisdom .
It would ratherWrite me a Fool , should I but only thinkThat any good to me could flow from you , Whom for so many years I have found and prov'dMy greatest Enemy : I am still the same , My wants have not transform 'd me : I dare tell you , To your new cerus 'd face , what I have spokenFreely behind your back , what I think of you , You are the proudest thing , and have the leastReason to be so that I ever read of.In stature you are a Giantess : and your TailorTakes measure of you with a Jacobs Staff , Or he can never reach you , this by the wayFor your large size : now , in a word or two , To treat of your Complexion were decorum : You are so far from fair , I doubt your MotherWas too familiar with the Moor that serv 'd her , Your Limbs and Features I pass briefly over , As things not worth description ; and come roundlyTo your Soul , if you have any ; for 't is doubtful .
I laugh at this , proceed .
This Soul I speak of , Or rather Salt to keep this heap of fleshFrom being a walking stench , like a large Inn , Stands open for the entertainment ofAll impious practices : but there 's no CornerAn honest thought can take up : and as it were notSufficient in your self to comprehendAll wicked plots , you have taught the Fool , my Brother , By your contagion , almost to put offThe nature of the man , and turn 'd him Devil , Because he should be like you , and I hopeWill march to Hell together : I have spoken , And if the Limning you in your true ColoursCan make the Painter gracious , I stand readyFor my reward , or if my words distaste you , I weigh it not , for though your Grooms were readyTo cut my Throat for't , be assur 'd I cannotUse other Language .
You think you have said now , Like a brave fellow : in this Womans WarYou ever have been train 'd : spoke big , but suffer'dLike a tame Ass ; and when most spur 'd and gall'dWere never Master of the Spleen or Spirit , That could raise up the anger of a man , And force it into action .
Yes , vile Creature , Wer't thou a subject worthy of my Sword , Or that thy death , this moment , could call homeMy banish 'd hopes , thou now wer't dead ; dead , woman ; But being as thou art , it is sufficientI scorn thee , and contemn thee .
This shews nobly , I must confess it : I am taken with it , For had you kneel 'd and whin 'd and shew 'd a baseAnd low dejected mind , I had despis 'd you.This bravery ( in your adverse fortune ) conquersAnd do 's command me , and upon the suddainI feel a kind of pity , growing in me , For your misfortunes , pity some say 's the Parent , Of future love , and I repent my partSo far in what you have suffered , that I could ( But you are cold ) do something to repairWhat your base Brother ( such Jamie I think him ) Hath brought to ruine .
Ha ?
Be not amaz 'd , Our injuries are equal in his Bastard , You are familiar with what I groan for , And though the name of Husband holds a tyeBeyond a Brother , I , a poor weak Woman , Am sensible , and tender of a wrong , And to revenge it would break through all lets , That durst oppose me .
Is it possible ?
By this kiss : start not : thus much , as a strangerYou may take from me ; but , if you were pleas 'd , I should select you as a bosom friend , I would print 'em thus , and thus .
Keep off .
Come near , Near into the Cabinet of my Counsels : Simplicity and patience dwell with Fools , And let them bear those burthens , which wise menBoldly shake off ; be mine and joyn with me , And when that I have rais 'd you to a fortune , ( Do not deny your self the happy means ) You 'll look on me with more judicious eyesAnd swear I am most fair .
What would this Woman ? The purpose of these words ? speak not in riddles , And when I understand , what you would counsel , My answer shall be suddain .
Thus then Jamie , The objects of our fury are the same , For young Ascanio , whom you Snake-like hug 'd ( Frozen with wants to death ) in your warm bosom , Lives to supplant you in your certain hopes , And kills in me all comfort .
Now 't is plain , I apprehend you : and were he remov 'd --
You , once again , were the undoubted heir .
'T is not to be deny 'd ; I was ice before , But now ye have fir 'd me. --
I'le add fuel to it , And by a nearer cut , do you but steerAs I direct you , wee'l bring our Bark intoThe Port of happiness .
How ?
By Henriques death : But you'l say he 's your Brother ; in great fortunes ( Which are epitomes of States and Kingdoms ) The politick brook no Rivals .
Excellent ! For sure I think out of a scrupulous fear , To feed in expectation , when I may ( Dispensing but a little with my conscience ) Come into full possession , would not argueOne that desir 'd to thrive .
Now you speak likeA man that knows the World .
I needs must learnThat have so good a Tutress : and what think you , ( Don Henrique and Ascanio cut off ) That none may live , that shall desire to trace usIn our black paths , if that OctavioHis foster Father , and the sad Jacinta , ( Faith pitie her , and free her from her Sorrows ) Should fall companions with 'em ? When we are redWith murther , let us often bath in blood , The colour will be scarlet .
And that 's glorious , And will protect the fact .
Suppose this done : ( If undiscovered ) we may get for mony , ( As that you know buyes any thing in Rome ) A dispensation .
And be married ?
True.Or if it be known , truss up our Gold and Jewels , And fly to some free State , and there with scorn --
Laugh at the laws of Spain.'Twere admirable .
We shall beget rare children. I am rapt withThe meer imagination. --
Shall it be done ?
Shall ? 't is too tedious : furnish me with meansTo hire the instruments , and to your selfSay it is done already : I will shew you , E 're the Sun set , how much you have wrought upon me , Your province is only to use some means , To send my Brother to the Grove that 's neighbourTo the west Port of th ' City ; leave the restTo my own practice ; I have talk 'd too long , But now will doe : this kiss , with my Confession , To work a fell revenge : a man 's a fool , If not instructed in a Womans School. [ Exeunt.SCENA II .
Bartolus , Algazeirs , and a Paratour .
You are well enough disguiz 'd , furnish the Table , Make no shew what ye are , till I discover : Not a soul knows ye here : be quick and diligent , These youths I have invited to a Breakfast , But what the Sawce will be , I am of opinionI shall take off the edges of their Appetites , And grease their gums for eating heartilyThis month or two , they have plaid their prizes with me , And with their several flurts they have lighted dangerously , But sure I shall be quit : I hear 'em coming.Go off and wait the bringing in your service , And do it handsomely : you know where to have it .
Milanes , Arsenio , Lopez , Diego.Welcom i ' Faith .
That 's well said , honest Lawyer .
Said like a neighbour .
Welcom all : all over , And let 's be merry .
To that end we came Sir , An hour of freedome 's worth an age of juglings .
I am come too Sir , to specifie my StomachA poor reteiner to your worships bountie .
And thou shalt have it fill 'd my merry Diego , My liberal , and my bonny bounteous Diego , Even fill 'd till it groan again .
Let it have fair play , And if it founder then. --
I'le tell ye neighbours , Though I were angry yesterday with ye all , And very angry , for methought ye bob 'd me .
No , no , by no means .
No , when I consideredIt was a jest , and carried off so quaintly , It made me merry : very merry , Gentlemen , I do confess I could not sleep to think o n't , The mirth so tickled me , I could not slumber .
Good mirth do 's work so : honest mirth , Now , should we have meant in earnest --
You say true neighbour .
It might have bred such a distast and sowrness , Such fond imaginations in your Brains , Sir , For things thrust home in earnest. --
Very certain , But I know ye all for merry waggs , and ere longYou shall know me too in another fashion , Though y'are pamper 'd , ye shall bear part o'th ' burthen .
Amaranta , and Leandro.Come wife ; Come bid 'em welcom ; Come my Jewel : And Pupil , you shall come too ; ne 're hang backward , Come , come the woman 's pleas 'd , her anger 's over , Come , be not bashfull .
What do 's he prepare here ? Sure there 's no meat i'th ' house , at least not drest , Do 's he mean to mock 'em ? or some new bred crotchetCome o 're his brains ; I do not like his kindness : But silence best becomes me : if he mean foul play , Sure they are enough to right themselves , and let 'em , I'le sit by , so they beat him not to powder .
Bring in the meat there , ha ? Sit down dear neighbour , A little meat needs little Complement , Sit down I say .
What do you mean by this Sir ?
Convey away their weapons handsomely .
You know there 's none i'th ' house to answer ye , But the poor Girle ; you know there 's no meat neither .
Peace and be quiet ; I shall make you smoak else , There 's men and meat enough , set it down formally .
Algazeirs , with dishes .
I fear some lewd trick , yet I dare not speak o n't .
I have no dainties for ye Gentlemen , Nor loads of meat , to make the room smell of 'em.Only a dish to every man I have dedicated , And if I have pleas 'd his appetite .
O , a Capon , A Bird of grace , and be thy will , I honour it .
For me some fortie pound of lovely Beef , Plac 'd in a mediterranean sea of Brewis .
Fall to , fall to , that we may drink and laugh after , Wait diligently knaves .
What rare bit 's this ? An execution ! bless me !
Nay take it to ye , There 's no avoiding it , 't is somewhat tough Sir , But a good stomach will endure it easily , The sum is but a thousand duckets Sir .
A Capias from my Surgeon , and my Silk-man !
Your carefull makers , but they have mar 'd your diet.Stir not , your Swords are gone : there 's no avoiding me , And these are Algazeirs , do you hear that passing bell ?
A strong Citation , bless me !
Out with your Beads , Curate , The Devil 's in your dish : bell , book , and Candle .
A warrant to appear before the Judges ! I must needs rise , and turn to th ' wall .
Ye need not , Your fear I hope will make ye find your Breeches .
We are betrai 'd .
Invited do not wrong me , Fall to , good Guests , you have diligent men about ye , Ye shall want nothing that may persecute ye , These will not see ye start ; Have I now found ye ? Have I requited ye ? You fool 'd the Lawyer , And thought it meritorious to abuse him , A thick ram-headed knave : you rid , you spur 'd him , And glorified your wits , the more ye wronged him ; Within this hour ye shall have all your Creditours , A second dish of new debts , come upon ye , And new invitements to the whip , Don Diego , And Excommunications for the learned Curate , A Masque of all your furies shall dance to ye .
You dare not use us thus ?
You shall be bob 'd , Gentlemen , Stir , and as I have a life , ye goe to prison , To prison , without pitie instantly , Before ye speak another word to prison.I have a better Guard without , that waits ; Do you see this man , Don Curate ? 't is a ParatourThat comes to tell ye a delightfull storyOf an old whore ye have , and then to teach yeWhat is the penaltie ; Laugh at me now Sir , What Legacie would ye bequeath me now , ( And pay it on the nail ? ) to fly my fury ?
O gentle Sir .
Do'st thou hope I will be gentle , Thou foolish unconsiderate Curate ?
Let me goe Sir .
I'le see thee hang first .
And as I am a true Vicar , Hark in your ear , hark softly --
No , no bribery.I'le have my swindge upon thee ; Sirra ? Rascal ? You Lenten Chaps , you that lay sick , and mockt me , Mockt me abominably , abused me lewdly , I'le make thee sick at heart , before I leave thee , And groan , and dye indeed , and be worth nothing , Not worth a blessing , nor a Bell to knell for thee , A sheet to cover thee , but that thou Stealest , Stealest from the Merchant , and the Ring he was buried withStealest from his Grave , do you smell me now ?
Have mercy on me !
No Psalm of mercy shall hold me from hanging thee.How do ye like your Breakfast ? 't is but short , Gentlemen , But sweet and healthfull ; Your punishment , and yours , Sir , For some near reasons that concern my Credit , I will take to my self .
Doe Sir , and spare not : I have been too good a wife , and too obedient , But since ye dare provoke me to be foolish --
She has , yes , and too worthie of your usage , Before the world I justifie her goodness , And turn that man , that dares but taint her vertues , To my Swords point ; that lying man , that base man , Turn him , but face to face , that I may know him .
What have I here ?
A Gentleman , a free man , One that made trial of this Ladies constancie , And found it strong as fate ; leave off your fooling , For if you follow this course , you will be Chronicled .
Jamy and Assistant.For a devil , whilst a Saint she is mentioned , You know my name indeed ; I am now no Lawyer .
Some comfort now , I hope , or else would I were hanged up.And yet the Judge , he makes me sweat .
What news now ?
I will justifie upon my life and creditWhat you have heard , for truth , and will make proof of .
I will be ready at the appointed hour there , And so I leave ye .
Stay I beseech your worship , And do but hear me .
Good Sir , intend this business , And let this bawling fool , no more words lawyer , And no more angers , for I guess your reasons , This Gentleman , I'le justifie in all places , And that fair Ladies worth ; let who dare cross it.The Plot was cast by me , to make thee jealous , But not to wrong your wife , she is fair and vertuous .
Take us to mercy too , we beseech your honour , We shall be justified the way of all flesh else .
No more talk , nor no more dissention lawyer , I know your anger , 't is a vain and slight one , For if you doe , I'le lay your whole life open , A life that all the world shall -- I'le bring witness , And rip before a Judge the ulcerous villanies , You know I know ye , and I can bring witness .
Nay good Sir , noble Sir .
Be at peace then presently , Immediatley take honest and fair truceWith your good wife , and shake hands with that Gentleman ; H'as honour 'd ye too much , and doe it cheerfully .
Take us along , for Heaven sake too .
I am friends , There is no remedie , I must put up all , And like my neighbours rub it out by th ' shoulders , And perfect friends ; Leandro now I thank ye , And there 's my hand , I have no more grudge to ye , But I am too mean henceforward for your Companie .
I shall not trouble ye .
We will be friends too .
Nay Lawyer , you shall not fright us farther , For all your devils we will bolt .
I grant ye , The Gentleman 's your Bail , and thank his coming , Did not he know me too well , you should smart for't ; Goe all in peace , but when ye fool next , Gentlemen , Come not to me to Breakfast .
I'le be bak 'd first .
And pray ye remember , when ye are bold and merry , The Lawyers Banquet , and the Sawce he gave ye .
Employment for your lewd brains too , to cool ye , For all , for every one .
We are all your Servants .
All , all for any thing , from this day forwardI'le hate all Breakfasts , and depend on dinners .
I am glad you come off fair .
The fair has blest me. [ Exeunt.SCENA III .
Octavi [ o ] , Jacinta , [ Ascanio ] .
This is the place , but why we are appointedBy Don Jamie to stay here , is a depthI can not sound .
Believ't he is too nobleTo purpose any thing but for our good.Had I assurance of a thousand lives , And with them perpetuitie of pleasure , And should lose all , if he prov 'd only false , Yet I durst run the hazard .
'T is our comfort , We can not be more wretched than we are , And death concludes all misery .
Undiscovered
Henrique , Jamie.We must attend him .
Our stay is not long.With him Don Henrique ?
Now I fear ; Be silent .
Why dost thou follow me ?
To save your life , A plot is laid for't , all my wrongs forgot , I have a Brothers Love .
But thy false selfI fear no enemy .
You have no friend , But what breathes in me : If you move a stepBeyond this ground you tread on , you are lost .
'T is by thy practice then : I am sent hitherTo meet her , that prefers my life and safetieBefore her own .
That you should be abus 'd thusWith weak credulitie ! She for whose sakeYou have forgot we had one noble Father , Or that one Mother bare us , for whose loveYou brake a contract to which heaven was witness , To satisfie whose pride and wilfull humourYou have expos 'd a sweet and hopefull SonTo all the miseries that want can bring him , And such a Son , though you are most obdurate , To give whom entertainment SavagesWould quit their Caves themselves , to keep him fromBleak cold and hunger : This dissembling woman , This Idol , whom you worship , all your loveAnd service trod under her feet , designs youTo fill a grave , or dead to lye a preyFor Wolves and Vulturs .
'T is false ; I defie thee , And stand upon my Guard .
Leandro , Milanes , Arsenio , Bart , Lopez , Diego , Octavio , Jacinta , Ascanio , and Servants .
Alas , 't is weak : Come on , since you will teach me to be cruel , By having no faith in me , take your fortune , Bring the rest forth , and bind them fast .
My Lord .
In what have we offended ?
I am deaf , And following my will , I do not standAccomptable to reason : See her Ring ( The first pledge of your love , and service to her ) Deliver 'd as a Warrant for your death : These Bags of gold you gave up to her trust , ( The use of which you did deny your self ) Bestow 'd on me , and with a prodigal hand , Whom she pick 'd forth to be the ArchitectOf her most bloudy building ; and to feeThese Instruments , to bring MaterialsTo raise it up , she bad me spare no cost , And ( as a surplusage ) offer 'd her selfTo be at my devotion .
O accurs 'd !
But be incredulous still ; think this my plot ; Fashion excuses to your self , and swearThat she is innocent , that she doats on ye ; Believe this , as a fearfull Dream , and thatYou lie not at my mercy , which in thisI will shew only : She her self shall giveThe dreadfull Sentence , to remove all scrupleWho 't is that sends you to the other world .
Appears my Violante ? speak ( my dearest ) Do 's not the object please you ?
More than ifAll treasure that 's above the earth , with that , That lyes conceal 'd in both the Indian Mines , Were laid down at my feet : O bold Jamy , Thou only canst deserve me .
I am forward , And ( as you easily may perceive , ) I sleep notOn your commands .
But yet they live : I look'dTo find them dead .
That was deferr 'd , that youMight triumph in their misery , and have the powerTo say they are not .
'T was well thought upon : This kiss , and all the pleasures of my BedThis night , shall thank thee .
Monster !
You Sir , thatWould have me Mother Bastards , being unableTo honour me with one Child of mine own , That underneath my roof , kept your cast-Strumpet , And out of my Revenues would maintainHer riotous issue : now you find what 'tisTo tempt a woman : with as little feelingAs I turn off a slave , that is unfitTo doe me service ; or a horse , or dogThat have out-liv 'd their use , I shake thee off , To make thy peace with heaven .
I do deserve this , And never truly felt before , what sorrowAttends on wilfull dotage .
For you , Mistris , That had the pleasure of his youth before me , And triumph 'd in the fruit that you had by him , But that I think , to have the Bastard strangledBefore thy face , and thou with speed to followThe way he leads thee , is sufficient torture , I would cut off thy nose , put out thine eyes , And set my foot on these bewitching lips , That had the start of mine : but as thou art , Goe to the grave unpitied .
Who would believeSuch rage could be in woman ?
For this fellow , He is not worth my knowledge .
Let him live then , Since you esteem him innocent .
No Jamy , He shall make up the mess : now strike together , And let them fall so .
Unheard of crueltie ! I can endure no longer : seise on her .
Am I betrai 'd ? Is this thy faith , Jamy ?
Could your desiresChallenge performance of a deed so horrid ? Or , though that you had sold your self to hell , I should make up the bargain ? Live ( dear Brother ) Live long , and happy : I forgive you freely ; To have done you this service , is to meA fair Inheritance : and how e 're harsh language ( Call 'd on by your rough usage ) pass 'd my lips , In my heart I ever lov 'd you : all my laboursWere but to shew , how much your love was cozen 'd , When it beheld it self in this false Glass , That did abuse you ; and I am so farFrom envying young Ascanio his good fortune , That if your State were mine , I would adopt him , These are the Murtherers my noble friends , Which ( to make trial of her bloudy purpose ) I won , to come disguis 'd thus .
I am too fullOf grief , and shame to speak : but what I'le doe , Shall to the world proclaim my penitence ; And howsoever I have liv 'd , I'le dieA much chang 'd man .
Were it but possibleYou could make satisfaction to this woman , Our joyes were perfect .
That 's my only comfort , That it is in my power : I ne 're was marriedTo this bad woman , though I doted on her , But daily did defer it , still expectingWhen grief would kill Jacintha .
All is come out , And finds a fair success : take her Don Henrique , And once again embrace your Son .
Most gladly .
Your Brother hath deserv 'd all .
And shall shareThe moitie of my State .
I have heard , advocate , What an ill Instrument you have been to him , From this time strengthen him with honest counsels , As you'le deserve my pardon .
I'le change my Copy : But I am punish 'd , for I fear I have hadA smart blow , though unseen .
Curate , and Sexton , I have heard of you too , let me hear no more , And what 's past , is forgotten ; For this woman , Though her intent were bloody , yet our LawCalls it not death : yet that her punishmentMay deter others from such bad attempts , The dowry she brought with her , shall be emploi'dTo build a Nunnery , where she shall spendThe remnant of her life .
Since I have miss 'd my ends , I scorn what can fall on me .

Is he then taken ?
And brought back even now , Sir .
He was not in disgrace ?
No man more lov 'd , Nor more deserv 'd it , being the only manThat durst be honest in this Court .
IndeedWe have heard abroad , Sir , that the State hath sufferedA great change , since the Countesses death .
It hath , Sir .
My five years absence hath kept me a strangerSo much to all the occurents of my Country , As you shall bind me for some short relationTo make me understand the present times .
I must begin then with a War was madeAnd seven years with all cruelty continuedUpon our Flanders by the Duke of Brabant , The cause grew thus : during our Earls minority,
, ( who now usurps ) was employed thitherTo treat about a match between our EarlAnd the Daughter and Heir of Brabant : during which treatyThe Brabander pretends , this Daughter wasStoln from his Court , by practice of our State , Though we are all confirm 'd , 't was a sought quarrelTo lay an unjust gripe upon this Earldom , It being here believ 'd the Duke of BrabantHad no such loss. This War upo n't proclaimed , Our Earl , being then a Child , although his FatherGood Gerrard liv 'd , yet in respect he wasChosen by the Countesses favour , for her Husband , And but a Gentleman , and Florez holdingHis right unto this Country from his Mother , The State thought fit in this defensive War,
being then the only man of mark , To make him General .
Which place we have heardHe did discharge with ho [ n ] our .
Sir , I receive the knowledge of thus much , As a choice favour from you .
Only I must add,
holds out .
Whither , Sir , I am going , For there last night I had a ship put in , And my Horse waits me. [ Exit .
I wish you a good journey .
Wolfort , Hubert .
What ? Hubert stealing from me ? who disarm 'd him ? It was more than I commanded ; take your sword , I am best guarded with it in your hand , I have seen you use it nobly .
And will turn itOn my own bosom , ere it shall be drawnUnworthily or rudely .
Would you leave meWithout a farewel , Hubert ? flie a friendUnwearied in his study to advance you ? What have I e 're possess 'd which was not yours ? Or either did not court you to command it ? Who ever yet arriv 'd to any grace , Reward or trust from me , but his approachesWere by your fair reports of him prefer 'd ? And what is more I made my self your Servant , In making you the Master of those secretsWhich not the rack of Conscience could draw from me , Nor I , when I askt mercy , trust my prayers with ; Yet after these assurances of love , These tyes and bonds of friendship , to forsake me ? Forsake me as an enemy ? come you mustGive me a reason .
Sir , and so I will , If I may do't in private : and you hear it .
All leave the room : you have your will , sit downAnd use the liberty of our first friendship .
Friendship ? when you prov 'd Traitor first , that vanish 'd , Nor do I owe you any thought , but hate , I know my flight hath forfeited my head ; And so I may make you first understandWhat a strange monster you have made your self , I welcome it .
To me this is strange language .
To you ? why what are you ?
Your Prince and Master , The Earl of Flanders.Hub. By a proper title ! Rais 'd to it by cunning , circumvention , force , Blood , and proscriptions .
And in all this wisdom , Had I not reason ? when by Gerrards plotsI should have first been call 'd to a strict accomptHow , and which way I had consum 'd that massOf money , as they term it , in the War , Who underhand had by his MinistersDetracted my great action , made my faithAnd loyalty suspected , in which failingHe sought my life by practice .
With what fore-headDo you speak this to me ? who ( as I know't ) Must , and will say 't is false .
My Guard there .
Sir , you bad me sit , and promis 'd you would hear , Which I now say you shall ; not a sound more , For I that am contemner of mine own , Am Master of your life ; then here 's a SwordBetween you , and all aids , Sir , though you blindThe credulous beast , the multitude , you pass notThese gross untruths on me .
How ? gross untruths ?
I , and it is favourable language , They had been in a mean man lyes , and foul ones .
You take strange Licence .
Yes , were not those rumoursOf being called unto your answer , spreadBy your own followers ? and weak Gerrard wrought ( But by your cunning practice ) to believeThat you were dangerous ; yet not to bePunish 'd by any formal course of Law , But first to be made sure , and have your crimesLaid open after , which your quaint train takingYou fled unto the Camp , and [ there ] crav 'd humblyProtection for your innocent life , and that , Since you had scap 'd the fury of the War , You might not fall by treason : and for proof , You did not for your own ends make this danger ; Some that had been before by you suborn 'd , Came forth and took their Oaths they had been hir'dBy Gerrard to your Murther. This once heard , And easily believ 'd , th'inraged SouldierSeeing no further than the outward-man , Snatch 'd hastily his Arms , ran to the Court , Kill 'd all that made resistance , cut in piecesSuch as were Servants , or thought friends to Gerrard , Vowing the like to him .
Will you yet end ?
Which he foreseeing , with his Son , the Earl , Forsook the City ; and by secret wayesAs you give out , and we would gladly have it , Escap 'd their fury : though 't is more than fear'dThey fell amongst the rest ; Nor stand you thereTo let us only mourn the impious meansBy which you got it , but your cruelties sinceSo far transcend your former bloody ills , As if compar 'd , they only would appearEssays of mischief ; do not stop your ears , More are behind yet .
O repeat them not , 'T is Hell to hear them nam 'd .
You should have thought , That Hell would be your punishment when you did them , A Prince in nothing but your princely lusts , And boundless rapines .
No more I beseech you .
Who was the Lord of house or land , that stoodWithin the prospect of your covetous eye ?
You are in this to me a greater Tyrant , Than e 're I was to any .
I end thusThe general grief : now to my private wrong ; The loss of Gerrards Daughter Jaqueline : The hop 'd for partner of my lawful Bed , Your cruelty hath frighted from mine arms ; And her I now was wandring to recover.Think you that I had reason now to leave you , When you are grown so justly odious , That ev'n my stay here with your grace and favour , Makes my life irksome ? here , surely take it , And do me but this fruit of all your friendship , That I may dye by you , and not your Hang-man .
Oh Hubert , these your words and reasons haveAs well drawn drops of blood from my griev 'd heart , As these tears from mine eyes ; Despise them not.By all that 's sacred , I am serious , Hubert , You now have made me sensible , what furies , Whips , Hangmen , and Tormentors a bad manDo 's ever bear about him : let the goodThat you this day have done , be ever number'dThe first of your best actions ; Can you think , Where Goswin is or Gerrard , or your love , Or any else , or all that are proscrib 'd ? I will resign , what I usurp , or haveUnjustly forc 'd ; the dayes I have to liveAre too too few to make them satisfactionWith any penitence : yet I vow to practiseAll of a man .
O that your heart and tongueDid not now differ !
By my griefs they do not.Take the good pains to search them out : 't is worth it , You have made clean a Leper : trust me you have , And made me once more fit for the society , I hope of good men .
Sir , do not abuseMy aptness to believe .
Suspect not youA faith that 's built upon so true a sorrow , Make your own safetys : ask them all the tiesHumanity can give , Hemskirk too shallAlong with you to this so wish 'd discovery , And in my name profess all that you promise ; And I will give you this help to't : I haveOf late receiv 'd certain intelligence , That some of them are in or about BrugesTo be found out : which I did then interpret , The cause of that Towns standing out against me ; But now am glad , it may direct your purposeOf giving them their safety , and me peace .
Be constant to your goodness , and you have it. [ Exeunt.SCENA II .
Merchants .
'T is much that you deliver of this Goswin .
Goswin , and the fourth Merchant .
I take it at your own rates , your wine of Cyprus , But for your Candy sugars , they have metWith such foul weather , and are priz 'd so highI can not save in them.4 Mer. I am unwillingTo seek another Chapman : make me offerOf something near price , that may assure meYou can deal for them .
I both can , and will , But not with too much loss ; your bill of ladingSpeaks of two hundred chests , valued by youAt thirty thousand gilders , I will have themAt twenty eight ; so , in the payment ofThree thousand sterling , you fall only inTwo hundred pound.4 Mer. You know , they are so cheap. --
Why look you ; I'le deal fa [ ir ] ly , there 's in prison , And at your suit , a Pirat , but unableTo make you satisfaction , and past hopeTo live a week , if you should prosecuteWhat you can prove against him : set him free , And you shall have your mony to a Stiver , And present payment.4 Mer. This is above wonder , A Merchant of your rank , that have at SeaSo many Bottoms in the danger ofThese water-Thieves , should be a means to save 'em , It more importing you for your own safetyTo be at charge to scour the Sea of themThan stay the sword of justice , that is readyTo fall on one so conscious of his guiltThat he dares not deny it .
You mistake me , If you think I would cherish in this CaptainThe wrong he did to you , or any man ; I was lately with him , ( having first , from othersTrue testimony been assured a manOf more desert never put from the shore ) I read his letters of Mart from this State grantedFor the recovery of such losses , asHe had receiv 'd in Spain , 't was that he aim 'd at , Not at three tuns of wine , bisket , or beef , Which his necessity made him take from you.If he had pillag 'd you near , or sunk your ship , Or thrown your men o'r-board , then he deserv'dThe Laws extreamest rigour. But since wantOf what he could not live without , compel 'd himTo that he did ( which yet our State calls death ) I pity his misfortune ; and to work youTo some compassion of them , I come upTo your own price : save him , the goods are mine ; If not , seek else-where , I'le not deal for them .
Well Sir , for your love , I will once be ledTo change my purpose .
For your profit rather .
I'le presently make means for his discharge , Till when , I leave you .
What do you think of this ?
As of a deed of noble pity : guidedBy a strong judgement .
Save you Master Goswin .
Good day to all .
We bring you the refusalOf more Commodities .
Are you the ownersOf the ship that last night put into the Harbour ?
Both of the ship , and lading .
What 's the fraught ?
Indico , Cochineel , choise Chyna stuffs .
And cloath of Gold brought from Cambal .
Rich lading , For which I were your Chapman , but I amAlready out of cash .
I'le give you dayFor the moiety of all .
How long ?
Six months .
'T is a fair offer : which ( if we agreeAbout the prices ) I , with thanks accept of , And will make present payment of the rest ; Some two hours hence I'le come aboard .
The Gunner shall speak you welcom .
I'le not fail .
Good morrow. [ Ex. Merch .

Bless my good Master , The prayers of your poor Beads-man ever shallBe sent up for you .
God o ' mercy Clause , There 's something to put thee in mind hereafterTo think of me .
May he that gave it youReward you for it , with encrease , good Master .
I thrive the better for thy prayers .
I hope so.This three years have I fed upon your bounties , And by the fire of your blest charity warm 'd me , And yet , good Master , pardon me , that must , Though I have now receiv 'd your alms , presumeTo make one sute more to you .
What is't Clause ?
Yet do not think me impudent I beseech you , Since hitherto your charity hath preventedMy begging your relief , 't is not for monyNor cloaths ( good Master ) but your good word for me .
That thou shalt have , Clause , for I think thee honest .
To morrow then ( dear M'r. ) take the troubleOf walking early unto Beggars Bush , And as you see me , among others ( BrethrenIn my affliction ) when you are demandedWhich you like best among us , point out me , And then pass by , as if you knew me not .
But what will that advantage thee ?
O much Sir , 'Twill give me the preheminence of the rest , Make me a King among 'em , and protect meFrom all abuse , such as are stronger , mightOffer my age ; Sir , at your better leisureI will inform you further of the goodIt may do to me .
'Troth thou mak'st me wonder ; Have you a King and common-wealth among you ?
We have , and there are States are govern 'd worse .
Ambition among Beggars ?
Many great onesWould part with half their states , to have the place , And credit to beg in the first file , Master : But shall I be so much bound to your furtheranceIn my Petition ?
That thou shalt not miss of , Nor any worldly care make me forget it , I will be early there .
Heaven bless my Master. [ Exeunt .

What ail you Sirs ? what means this outcry ?
Master , A sort of poor souls met : Gods fools , good Master , Have had some little variance amongst our selvesWho should be honestest of us , and which livesUprightest in his calling : Now , 'cause we thoughtWe ne 're should 'gree o n't our selves , becauseIndeed 't is hard to say : we all dissolv 'd , to put itTo him that should come next , and that 's your Master-ship , Who , I hope , will 'termine it as your mind serves you , Right , and no otherwise we ask it : which ? Which does your worship think is he ? sweet MasterLook over us all , and tell us ; we are seven of us , Like to the seven wise Masters , or the Planets .

And what they get there , is their own , besidesTo give good words .
Do you mark ? to cut been whids , That is the second Law .
And keep a-footThe humble , and the common phrase of begging , Lest men discover us .
Yes ; and cry sometimes , To move compassion : Sir , there is a table , That doth command all these things , and enjoyns 'em , Be perfect in their crutches , their feign 'd plaisters , And their torn pass-ports , with the ways to stammer , And to be dumb , and deaf , and blind , and lame , There , all the halting paces are set down , I'th ' learned language .

A Cove comes , and fumbumbis to it. -- Strike .
Cast our Caps and cares away : this is Beggars Holy-day , At the Crowning of our King , thus we ever dance and sing.In the world look out and see : where 's so happy a Prince as he ? Where the Nation live so free , and so merry as do we ? Be it peace , or be it war , here at liberty we are , And enjoy our ease and rest ; To the field we are not prest ; Nor are call 'd into the Town , to be troubled with the Gown.Hang all Officers we cry , and the Magistrate too , by ; When the Subsidie 's encreast , we are not a penny Sest.Nor will any go to Law , with the Beggar for a straw.All which happiness he brags , he doth owe unto his rags .

Fill till't be six-pence , And there 's my Pig .
This is a Counter , Sir .
A Counter ! stay ye , what are these then ? O execrable Jugler ! O dama 'd Jugler ! Look in your hose , hoa , this comes of looking forward .

Do ye call these tricks .

Have ye any Ends of Gold , or Silver ?

Good do'n my honest Fellows , You are merry here I see .
'T is all we have left , Sir .
What hast thou ? Aqua vitae ?
Yes .
Fill out then ; And give these honest Fellows round .
We thank ye .
May I speak a word in private to ye ?
Yes Sir .
I have a business for you , honest Friends , If you dare lend your help , shall get you crowns .
Ha ! Lead me a little nearer , Boy .
What is't Sir ? If it be any thing to purchase money , Which is our want , [ command ] us .
All , all , all , Sir .
You know the young spruce Merchant in Bruges ?
Who ? Master Goswin ?
That he owes me money , And here in town there is no stirring of him .
Say ye so ?
This day , upon a sure appointment , He meets me a mile hence , by the Chase side , Under the row of Oaks ; do you know it ?
Yes Sir .
Give 'em more drink : there if you dare but ventureWhen I shall give the word to seize upon himHere 's twenty pound .
Beware the Jugler .
If he resist , down with him , have no mercy .
I warrant you , we 'll hamper him .
To discharge you , I have a Warrant here about me .
Here 's our Warrant , This carries fire i'th ' Tail .
Away with me then , The time draws on , I must remove so insolent a Suitor , And if he be so rich , make him pay ransomeEre he see Bruges Towers again. Thus wise menRepair the hurts they take by a disgrace , And piece the Lions skin with the Foxes case .
I am glad I have heard this sport yet .
There 's for thy drink , come pay the house within Boys , And lose no time .
Away with all our haste too. [ Exeunt.SCENE II .

Now upon 'em bravely , Conjure 'em soundly Boys .
Hold , hold .
Lay on still , Down with that Gentleman rogue , swinge him to sirrup.Retire Sir , and take Breath : follow , and take him , Take all , 't is lawful prize .
We yield .
Down with 'emInto the Wood , and rifle 'em , tew 'em , swinge 'em , Knock me their brains into their Breeches. [ Exeunt .
Hold , hold .
What these men are I know not , nor for what causeThey shou 'd thus thrust themselves into my danger , Can I imagine. But sure Heavens hand was i n't ! Nor why this coward Knave should deal so baselyTo eat me up with Slaves : but Heaven I thank thee , I hope thou hast reserv 'd me to an endFit for thy creature , and worthy of thine honour : Would all my other dangers here had suffered , With what a joyful heart should I go home then ? Where now , Heaven knows , like him that waits his sentence , Or hears his passing Bell ; but there 's my hope still .
Gerrard .
Blessing upon you Master .
Thank ye ; leave me , For by my troth I have nothing now to give thee .
Indeed I do not ask Sir , only it grieves meTo see ye look so sad ; now goodness keep yeFrom troubles in your mind .
If I were troubled , What could thy comfort do ? prithee Clause , leave me .
Good Master be not angry ; for what I sayIs out of true love to ye .
I know thou lov'st me .
Good Mr. blame that love then , if I prove so sawcyTo ask ye why ye are sad .
Most true , I am so , And such a sadness I have got will sink me .
Heaven shield it , Sir .
Faith , thou must lose thy Master .
I had rather lose my neck , Sir : would I knew --
What would the knowledg do thee good so miserable , Thou canst not help thy self ? when all my waysNor all the friends I have --
You do not know Sir , What I can do : cures sometimes , for mens caresFlow , where they least expect 'em .
I know thou wouldst do , But farewell Clause , and pray for thy poor Master .
I will not leave ye .
How ?
I dare not leave ye , Sir , I must not leave ye , And till ye beat me dead , I will not leave ye.By what ye hold most precious , by Heavens goodness , As your fair youth may prosper , good Sir tell me : My mind believes yet something 's in my powerMay ease you of this trouble .
I will tell thee , For a hundred thousand crowns upon my credit , Taken up of Merchants to supply my traffiques , The winds and weather envying of my fortune , And no return to help me off , yet shewingTo morrow , Clause , to morrow , which must come , In prison thou shalt find me poor and broken .
I can not blame your grief Sir .
Now , what say'st thou ?
I say you should not shrink , for he that gave ye , Can give you more ; his power can bring ye off Sir , When friends and all forsake ye , yet he sees you .
There 's all my hope .
Hope still Sir , are you ty'dWithin the compass of a day , good Master , To pay this mass of mony ?
Ev'n to morrow : But why do I stand mocking of my misery ? Is't not enough the floods , and friends forget me ?
Will no less serve ?
What if it would ?
Your patience , I do not ask to mock ye : 't is a great sum , A sum for mighty men to start and stick at ; But not for honest : have ye no friends left ye , None that have felt your bounty ? worth this duty ?
Duty ? thou knowst it not .
It is a duty , And as a duty , from those men have felt ye , Should be return 'd again : I have gain 'd by ye , A daily alms these seven years you have showr 'd on me , Will half supply your want .
Why do'st thou fool me ? Can'st thou work miracles ?
To save my Master , I can work this .
Thou wilt make me angry with thee .
For doing good ?
What power hast thou ?
Enquire not : So I can do it , to preserve my Master ; Nay if it be three parts .
O that I had it , But good Clause , talk no more , I feel thy charity , As thou hast felt mine : but alas !
Distrust not , 'T is that that quenches ye : pull up your Spirit , Your good , your honest , and your noble Spirit ; For if the fortunes of ten thousand peopleCan save ye , rest assur 'd ; you have forgot Sir , The good ye did , which was the power you gave me ; Ye shall now know the King of Beggars treasure : And let the winds blow as they list , the Seas roar , Yet , here to morrow , you shall find your harbour.Here fail me not , for if I live I'le fit ye .
How fain I would believe thee !
If I ly Master , Believe no man hereafter .
I will try thee , But he knows , that knows all .
Know me to morrow , And if I know not how to cure ye , kill me ; So pass in peace , my best , my worthiest Master. [ Exeunt.SCENA III .
Hubert , like a Huntsman .
Thus have I stoln away disguiz 'd from HemskirkTo try these people , for my heart yet tells meSome of these Beggars , are the men I look for : Appearing like my self , they have no reason ( Though my intent is fair , my main end honest ) But to avoid me narrowly , that face too , That womans face , how near it is ! O may itBut prove the same , and fortune how I'le bless thee ! Thus , sure they can not know me , or suspect me , If to my habit I but change my nature ; As I must do ; this is the wood they live in , A place fit for concealment : where , till fortuneCrown me with that I seek , I'le live amongst 'em.

Come bring 'em out , for here we sit in justice : Give to each one a cudgel , a good cudgel : And now attend your sentence. That you are rogues , And mischievous base rascalls , ( there 's the point now ) I take it , is confess 'd .
Deny it if you dare knaves .
We are Rogues Sir .
To amplify the matter then , rogues as ye are , And lamb 'd ye shall be e 're we leave ye .
Yes Sir .
And to the open handling of our justice , Why did ye this upon the proper personOf our good Master ? were you drunk when you did it ?
Yes indeed were we .
You shall be beaten sober .
Was it for want you undertook it ?
Yes Sir .
You shall be swing 'd abundantly .
And yet for all that , You shall be poor rogues still .
Has not the Gentleman , Pray mark this point Brother Prig , that noble GentlemanReliev 'd ye often , found ye means to live by , By imploying some at Sea , some here , some there ; According to your callings ?
'T is most true Sir .
Is not the man , an honest man ?
Yes truly .
A liberal Gentleman ? and as ye are true rascalsTell me but this , have ye not been drunk , and often , At his charge ?
Often , often .
There 's the point then , They have cast themselves , Brother Prig .
A shrewd point , Brother .
Brother , proceed you now ; the cause is open , I am some what weary .
Can you do these things ? You most abhominable stinking Rascals , You turnip-eating Rogues .
We are truly sorry .
Knock at your hard hearts Rogues , and presentlyGive us a sign you feel compunction , Every man up with 's cudgel , and on his neighbourBestow such alms , 'till we shall say sufficient , For there your sentence lyes without partiality ; Either of head , or hide Rogues , without sparing , Or we shall take the pains to beat you dead else : You shall know your doom .
One , two , and three about it .
That fellow in the blue , has true Compunction , [ Beat one another.He beats his fellows bravely , oh , well struck boyes .

Hemskirk .
With all due reverence , We do resign Sir .
Now huffing Sir , what 's your name ?
What 's that to you Sir ?
It shall be ere we part .
My name is Hemskirk , I follow the Earl , which you shall feel .
No threatning , For we shall cool you Sir ; why did'st thou baselyAttempt the murder of the Merchant Goswin ?
What power hast thou to ask me ?
I will know it , Or fley thee till thy pain discover it .
He did me wrong , base wrong .
That can not save ye , Who sent ye hither ? and what further villaniesHave you in hand ?
Why would'st thou know ? what profit , If I had any private way , could riseOut of my knowledge , to do thee commodity ? Be sorry for what thou hast done , and make amends fool , I'le talk no further to thee , nor these Rascals .
Tye him to that tree .
I have told you whom I follow .
The Devil you should do , by your villanies , Now he that has the best way , wring it from him .
I undertake it : turn him to the Sun boyes ; Give me a fine sharp rush , will ye confess yet ?
Ye have rob 'd me already , now you'le murder me .
Murder your nose a little : does your head purge Sir ? To it again , 'twill do ye good .
Oh , I can not tell you any thing .
Proceed then .
There 's maggots in your nose , I'le fetch 'em out Sir .
O my head breaks .
The best thing for the rheum Sir , That falls into your worships eyes .
Hold , hold .
Speak then .
I know not what .
It lyes in 's brain yet , In lumps it lyes , I'le fetch it out the finest ; What pretty faces the fool makes ? heigh !
Hold , Hold , and I'le tell ye all , look in my doublet ; And there within the lining in a paper , You shall find all .
Go fetch that paper hither , And let him loose for this time .
Hubert .
Good ev'n my honest friends .
Good ev'n good fellow .
May a poor huntsman , with a merry heart , A voice shall make the forest ring about him , Get leave to live amongst ye ? true as steel , boyes ? That knows all chases , and can watch all hours , And with my quarter staff , though the Devil bid stand , Deal such an alms , shall make him roar again ? Prick ye the fearfull hare through cross waves , sheep-walks , And force the crafty Reynard climb the quicksetts ; Rouse ye the lofty Stag , and with my bell-horn , Ring him a knel , that all the woods shall mourn him , 'Till in his funeral tears , he fall before me ? The Polcat , Marterne , and the rich skin 'd LucerneI know to chase , the Roe , the wind out-stripping
himself , in all his bloody angerI can beat from the bay , and the wild SounderSingle , and with my arm 'd staff , turn the Boar , Spight of his foamy tushes , and thus strike him ; 'Till he fall down my feast .
A goodly fellow .
What mak'st thee here , ha ? [ aside .
We accept thy fellowship .
Hemskirk , thou art not right I fear , I fear thee. [ aside .
Ferret , with a Letter .
Here is the paper : and as he said we found it .
Give me it , I shall make a shift yet , old as I am , To find your knavery : you are sent here , Sirra , To discover certain Gentlemen , a spy-knave , And if ye find 'em , if not by perswasionTo bring 'em back , by poyson to despatch 'em .
By poyson , ha ?
Here is another , Hubert ; What is that Hubert Sir ?
You may perceive there .
I may perceive a villany and a rank one , Was he joyn 'd partner of thy knavery ?
No.He had an honest end , would I had had so , Which makes him scape such cut-throats .
So it seems.For here thou art commanded , when that HubertHas done his best and worthiest service , this wayTo cut his throat , for here he 's set down dangerous .
This is most impious .
I am glad we have found ye , Is not this true ?
Yes ; what are you the better ?
You shall perceive Sir , ere you get your freedom : Take him aside , and friend , we take thee to us , Into our company , thou dar'st be true unto us ?
I , and obedient too ?
As you had bred me .
Then take our hand : thou art now a servant to us , Welcom him all .
Stand off , stand off : I'le do it , We bid ye welcom three wayes ; first for your person , Which is a promising person , next for your quality , Which is a decent , and a gentle quality , Last for the frequent means you have to feed us , You can steal 't is to be presum 'd .
Yes , venison , and if you want --
'T is well you understand right , And shall practise daily : you can drink too ?
Soundly .
And ye dare know a woman from a weathercock ?
If I handle her .
Now swear him .
I crown thy nab , with a gag of benbouse , And stall thee by the Salmon into the clows , To mand on the pad , and strike all the cheats ; To Mill from the Ruffmans , commision and slates,

Now interpret this unto him .
I pour on thy pate a pot of good ale , And by the Rogues [ oth ] a Rogue thee instal : To beg on the way , to rob all thou meets ; To steal from the hedge , both the shirt and the sheets : And lye with thy wench in the straw till she twang , Let the Constable , Justice , and Devil go hang .
You are welcom Brother .
Welcom , welcom , welcom , but who shall have the keepingOf this fellow ?
Sir , if you dare but trust me ; For if I have kept wild dogs and beasts for wonder , And made 'em tame too : give into my custodyThis roaring Rascal , I shall hamper him , With all his knacks and knaveries , and I fear meDiscover yet a further villany in him ; O he smells ranck o'th ' Rascal .
Take him to thee , But if he scape --
Let me be ev'n hang 'd for him , Come Sir , I'le tye ye to my leash .
Away Rascal .
Be not so stubborn : I shall swindge ye soundly , And ye play tricks with me .
So , now come in , But ever have an eye Sir , to your Prisoner .
He must blind both mine eyes , if he get from me .

A thousand Chases , Forests , Parks : I'le make theeChief ranger over all the games .
When ?
Presently .
This may provoke me : and yet to prove a knave too .
'T is to prove honest : 't is to do good service , Service for him thou art sworn to , for thy Prince , Then for thy self that good ; what fool would live here , Poor , and in misery , subject to all dangers , Law , and lewd people can inflict , when bravelyAnd to himself he may be law and credit ?
Shall I believe thee ?
As that thou holdst most holy .
Ye may play tricks .
Then let me never live more .
Then you shall see Sir , I will do a serviceThat shall deserve indeed .
'T is well said , Huntsman , And thou shall be well thought of .
I will do it : 't is not your setting free , for that 's meer nothing , But such a service , if the Earl be noble , He shall for ever love me .
What is't Huntsman ?
Do you know any of these people live here ?
No .
You are a fool then : here be those , to have 'em , I know the Earl so well , would make him caper .
Any of the old Lords that rebel 'd ?
Peace , all , I know 'em every one , and can betray 'em .
But wilt thou doe this service ? [ Hub. ] If you'l keepYour faith , and free word to me .
Wilt thou swear me ?
No , no , I will believe ye : more than that too , Here 's the right heir .
O honest , honest huntsman !
Now , how to get these Gallants , there 's the matter , You will be constant , 't is no work for me else .
Will the Sun shine again ?
The way to get 'em .
Propound it , and it shall be done .
No sleight ; ( For they are Devilish crafty , it concerns 'em , ) Nor reconcilement , ( for they dare not trust neither ) Must doe this trick .
By force ?
I , that must doe it.And with the person of the Earl himself , Authority ( and mighty ) must come on 'em : Or else in vain : and thus I would have ye do it.To morrow-night be here : a hundred men will bear 'em , ( So he be there , for he 's both wise and valiant , And with his terrour will strike dead their forces ) The hour be twelve a Clock , now for a guideTo draw ye without danger on these persons , The woods being thick , and hard to hit , my selfWith some few with me , made unto our purpose , Beyond the wood , upon the plain , will wait yeBy the great Oak .
I know it : keep thy faith huntsman , And such a showr of wealth --
I warrant ye : Miss nothing that I tell ye .
No .
Farewel ; You have your liberty , now use it wisely ; And keep your hour , goe closer about the wood there , For fear they spy you .
Well .
And bring no noise with ye. [ Exit .
All shall be done to th ' purpose : farewel hunts-man .

Now , what 's the news in town ?
No news , but joy Sir ; Every man wooing of the noble Merchant , Who has his hearty commendations to ye .
Yes this is news , this night he 's to be married .
By th ' mass that 's true , he marrys Vandunks Daughter , The dainty black-ey 'd bell .
I would my clapperHung in his baldrick , a what a peal could I Ring ?
Married ?
'T is very true Sir , O the pyes , The piping-hot mince-pyes !
O the Plum-pottage !
For one leg of a goose now would I venture a limb boys , I love a fat goose , as I love allegiance , And -- -- -- upon the Boors , too well they know it , And therefore starve their poultry .
To be marriedTo Vandunks Daughter ?
O this [ pretious ] Merchant : What sport he will have ! but hark you brother Prig , Shall we do nothing in the foresaid wedding ? There 's mony to be got , and meat I take it , What think ye of a morise ?
No , by no means , That goes no further than the street , there leaves us , Now we must think of something that must draw usInto the bowels of it , into th ' buttery , Into the Kitchin , into the Cellar , somethingThat that old drunken Burgo-master loves , What think ye of a wassel ?
I think worthily .
And very fit it should be , thou , and Ferret , And Ginks to sing the Song : I for the structure , Which is the bowl .
Which must be up-sey English , Strong , lusty London beer ; let 's think more of it .
He must not marry .
Hubert .
By your leave in private , One word Sir , with ye ; Gerrard : do not start me , I know ye , and he knows ye , that best loves ye:
speaks to ye , and you must be Gerrard.The time invites you to it .
Make no show then , I am glad to see you Sir ; and I am Gerrard.How stand affairs ?
Fair , if ye dare now follow,
I have let goe , and these my causes , I'le tell ye privately , and how I have wrought him , And then to prove me honest to my friends , Look upon these directions , you have seen his .
Then will I speak a speech , and a brave speechIn praise of Merchants , where 's the Ape ?
-- -- -- Take him , A gowty Bear-ward stole him the other day .
May his Bears worry him , that Ape had paid it , What dainty tricks ! -- -- -- O that bursen Bear-ward : In his French doublet , with his blister 'd bullions , In a long stock ty 'd up ; O how daintilyWould I have made him wait , and shift a trencher , Carry a cup of wine ? ten thousand stinksWait on thy mangy hide , thou lowzy Bear-ward .
'T is passing well , I both believe and joy i n't , And will be ready : keep you here the mean while , And keep in , I must a while forsake ye , Upon mine anger no man stir , this two hours .
Not to the wedding Sir ?
Not any whither .
The wedding must be seen sir ; we want meat too.We are horrible out of meat .
Shall it be spoken , Fat Capons shak't their tails at 's in defiance ? And turkey tombs such honorable monuments , Shall piggs , Sir , that the Parsons self would envy , And dainty Ducks --
Not a word more , obey me. [ Exit Ger .
Why then come dolefull death , this is flat tyranny , And by this hand --
What ?
I'le goe sleep upon't. [ Exit Hig .
Nay , and there be a wedding , and we wanting , Farewel our happy days : we do obey Sir. [ Exeunt.SCENA V .
Merchants .
Well met Sir , you are for this lusty wedding .
I am so , so are you I take it .
Yes , And it much glads me , that to doe him serviceWho is the honour of our trade , and lustre , We meet thus happily .
He 's a noble fellow , And well becomes a bride of such a beauty .
She is passing fair indeed , long may their lovesContinue like their youths , in spring of sweetness , All the young Merchants will be hereNo doubt o n't , For he that comes not to attend this wedding , The curse of a most blind one fall upon him , A loud wife , and a lazie : here 's Vanlock .
Vanlock and Francis .
Well overtaken Gentlemen : save ye .
The same to you sir ; save ye fair Mistris Francis , I would this happy night might make you blush too .
She dreams apace .
That 's but a drowsie fortune .
Nay take us with ye too ; we come to that end , I am sure ye are for the wedding .
Hand and heart man : And what their feet can doe , I could have tript itBefore this whorson gout .
Clause .
Bless ye Masters .
Clause ? how now Clause ? thou art come to see thy Master , ( And a good master he is to all poor people ) In all his joy , 't is honestly done of thee .
Long may he live sir , but my business now isIf you would please to doe it , and to him too .
Goswin .
He 's here himself .
Stand at the door my friends ? I pray walk in : welcom fair Mistris Francis , See what the house affords , there 's a young LadyWill bid you welcom .
We joy your happiness. [ Exeunt .
I hope it will be so : Clause nobly welcom , My honest , my best friend , I have been carefullTo see thy monys --
Sir , that brought not me , Do you know this Ring again ?
Thou hadst it of me .
And do you well remember yet , the boun you gave meUpon the return of this ?
Yes , and I grant it , Be it what it will : ask what thou canst , I'le do it ; Within my power .
Ye are not married yet ?
No .
Faith I shall ask you that that will disturb ye , But I must put ye to your promise .
Do , And if I faint and flinch i n't --
Well said Master , And yet it grieves me too : and yet it must be .
Prethee distrust me not .
You must not marry , That 's part of the power you gave me : which to make up , You must presently depart , and follow me .
Not marry , Clause ?
Not if you keep your promise , And give me power to ask .
Pre'thee think better , I will obey , by Heaven .
I have thought the best , Sir
Give me thy reason , do'st thou fear her honesty ?
Chaste as the ice , for any thing I know , Sir .
Why should'st thou light on that then ? to what purpose ?
I must not now discover .
Must not marry ? Shall I break now when my poor heart is pawn 'd ? When all the preparation ?
Now or never .
Come , 't is not that thou would'st : thou do'st but fright me .
Upon my soul it is , Sir , and I bind ye .
Clause , can'st thou be so cruel ?
You may break , Sir , But never more in my thoughts appear honest .
Did'st ever see her ?
No .
She is such a thing , O Clause , she is such a wonder , such a mirror , For beauty , and fair vertue , Europe has not : Why hast thou made me happy , to undo me ? But look upon her ; then if thy heart relent not , I'le quit her presently : who waits there ?
[ within ] Sir .
Bid my fair love come hither , and the Company.Prethee be good unto me ; take a mans heartAnd look upon her truly : take a friends heartAnd feel what misery must follow this .
Take you a noble heart and keep your promise ; I forsook all I had , to make you happy .
Gertrude , Vandunk , and the rest Merchants.Can that thing call 'd a Woman , stop your goodness ?
Look there she is , deal with me as thou wilt now , Did'st ever see a fairer ?
She is most goodly .
Pray ye stand still .
What ails my love ?
Didst thou ever , By the fair light of Heave [ n ] , behold a sweeter ? O that thou knew'st but love , or ever felt him , Look well , look narrowly upon her beauties .
Sure h'as some strange design in hand , he starts so .
This Beggar has a strong power over his pleasure .
View all her body,
'T is exact and excellent .
Is she a thing then to be lost thus lightly ? Her mind is ten times sweeter , ten times nobler , And but to hear her speak , a Paradise , And such a love she bears to me , a chaste love , A vertuous , fair , and fruitful love : 't is now tooI am ready to enjoy it ; the Priest ready , Clause , To say the holy words shall make us happy , This is a cruelty beyond mans study , All these are ready , all our joyes are ready , And all the expectation of our friends , 'Twill be her death to do it .
Let her dye then .
Thou canst not : 't is impossible .
It must be .
'Twill kill me too , 'twill murder me : by heaven ClauseI'le give thee half I have ; come thou shalt save me .
Then you must go with me : I can stay no longer , If ye be true , and noble .
Hard heart , I'le follow : Pray ye all go in again , and pray be merry , I have a weighty business , ( give my Cloak there , )
Servant ( with a Cloak. ) Concerns my life , and state , ( make no enquiry , ) This present hour befaln me : with the soonestI shall be here again : nay pray go in , Sir , And take them with you , 't is but a night lost , Gentlemen .

I will not stay ; believe , Sir. [ Exit .

Why is this stop , Sir ?
I have no more time left me , but to kiss thee , And tell thee this , I am ever thine : farewel wench. [ Exit .

Fear nothing , I do know it : would 'twere homeward .
Wrought from me by a Beggar ? at the timeThat most should tye him ? 't is some other LoveThat hath a more command on his affections , And he that fetcht him , a disguised Agent , Not what he personated ; for his fashionWas more familiar with him , and more powerfulThan one that ask 'd an alms : I must find outOne , if not both : kind darkness be my shrowd , And cover loves too curious search in me , For yet , suspicion , I would not name thee .
Mistris , it grows somewhat pretty and dark .
What then ?
Nay , nothing ; do not think I am afraid , Although perhaps you are .
I am not , forward .
Sure but you are ? give me your hand , fear nothing.There 's one leg in the wood , do not pull me backward : What a sweat one on 's are in , you or I ? Pray God it do not prove the plague ; yet sureIt has infected me ; for I sweat too , It runs out at my knees , feel , feel , I pray you .
What ails the fellow ?
Hark , hark I beseech you , Do you hear nothing ?
No .

The braying of an Ass , is it not ?
Oh , now one has me ; Oh my left haunch , farewel .
Look to your Shanks , Your Breech is safe enough , the Wolf 's a Fern-brake .
But see , see , see , there is a Serpent in it ; It has eyes as broad as Platters ; it spits fire ; Now it creeps towards us , help me to say my Prayers : It hath swallowed me almost , my breath is stopt ; I can not speak : do I speak Mistress ? tell me .
Why , thou strange timerous Sot , canst thou perceiveAny thing i'th ' Bush but a poor Glo-worm ?
It may be 't is but a Glo-worm now , but 'twillGrow to a Fire-drake presently .
Come thou from it : I have a precious guide of you , and a courteous , That gives me leave to lead my self the way thus .

Mistress ? Look forth Souldiers .
What are you Sirrah ?
Truly all is leftOf a poor Boor , by day-light , by night no body , You might have spar 'd your Drum , and Guns , and Pikes tooFor I am none that will stand out Sir , I.You may take me in with a walking Stick , Even when you please , and hold me with a packthred .
What woman was't you call 'd to ?
Woman ! none Sir .
None ! did you not name Mistress ?
Yes , but she'sNo woman yet : she should have been this night , But that a Beggar stole away her Bridegroom , Whom we were going to make hue and cry after ; I tell you true Sir , she should ha ' been married to day ; And was the Bride and all ; but in came Clause , The old lame Beggar , and whips up Mr GoswinUnder his arm ; away with him as a Kite , Or an old Fox would swoop away a Gosling .
'T is she , 't is she , 't is she : Niece ?
Ha !
She Sir , This was a noble entrance to your fortune , That being on the point thus to be married , Upon her venture here , you should surprise her .
I begin , Hemskirk , to believe my fate , Works to my ends .
Yes Sir , and this adds trustUnto the fellow our guide , who assur 'd me FlorezLiv 'd in some Merchants shape , as Gerrard didI ' the old Beggars , and that he would useHim for the train , to call the other forth ; All which we find is done -- That 's he again -- [ Holla again .

But what 's the action we are for now ? Ha ! Robbing a Ripper of his Fish .
Or takingA Poulterer Prisoner , without ransome , Bullyes ?
Or cutting off a Convoy of Butter ?
Or surprizing a Boors ken , for granting cheats !
Or cackling Cheats ?
Or Mergery-praters , Rogers , And Tibs o'th ' Buttery ?
O I could drive a RegimentOf Geese afore me , such a night as this , Ten Leagues with my Hat and Staff , and not a hissHeard , nor a wing of my Troops disordered .
Tell us , If it be milling of a lag of duds , The fetching of a back of cloaths or so ; We are horribly out of linnen .
No such matter .
Let me alone with the Farmers dog , If you have a mind to the cheese-loft ; 't is but thus , And he is a silenc 'd Mastiff , during pleasure .
Would it would please you to be silent .

Who 's there ?
A friend , the Hunts-man .
O 't is he .
I have kept touch Sir , which is the Earl of these ? Will he know a man now ?
This my Lord 's the Friend , Hath undertook the service .
If't be worthHis Lordships thanks anon , when 't is doneLording , I 'll look for't , a rude Wood-man , I know how to pitch my toils , drive in my game : And I have do n't , both Florez and his FatherOld Gerrard , with Lord Arnold of Benthuisen,
, and Jaculin , young Florez 's Sister : I have 'em all .
Thou speak'st too much , too happy , To carry faith with it .
I can bring youWhere you shall see , and find 'em .
We will doubleWhat ever Hemskirk then hath promis 'd thee .
And I 'll deserve it treble : what horse ha ' you ?
A hundred. That 's well : ready to takeUpon surprise of 'em .
Yes .
Divide thenYour force into five Squadrons ; for there areSo many out-lets , ways through the woodThat issue from the place where they are lodg 'd : Five several ways , of all which Passages , We must possess our selves , to round 'em in ; For by one starting hole they 'll all escape else : I and 4. Boors here to me will be guides , The Squadron where you are , my self will lead : And that they may be more secure , I 'll useMy wonted whoops , and hollows , as I wereA hunting for 'em ; which will make them restCareless of any noise , and be a directionTo the other guides , how we approach 'em still .
'T is order 'd well , and relisheth the Souldier ; Make the division Hemskirk ; you are my charge , Fair One , I 'll look to you .
Shall no body needTo look to me ? I 'll look unto my self .
'T is but this , remember .
Say , 't is done , Boy. [ Exeunt.SCENA II .
Gerrard and Florez .
By this time Sir I hope you want no reasonsWhy I broke off your marriage , for though IShould as a Subject study you my PrinceIn things indifferent , it will not thereforeDiscredit you , to acknowledge me your Father , By harkning to my necessary counsels .
Acknowledge you my Father ? Sir I do , And may impiety , conspiring withMy other Sins , sink me , and suddenlyWhen I forget to pay you a Sons dutyIn my obedience , and that help 'd forthWith all the cheerfulness .
I pray you rise , And may those powers that see and love this in you , Reward you for it : Taught by your exampleHaving receiv 'd the rights due to a Father , I tender you th ' allegeance of a Subject : Which as my Prince accept of .
Kneel to me ? May mountains first fall down beneath their valleys , And fire no more mount upwards , when I sufferAn act in nature so preposterous ; I must o'ercome in this , in all things elseThe victory be yours : could you here read me , You should perceive how all my facultiesTriumph in my blest fate , to be found yours ; I am your son , your son Sir , and am prouderTo be so , to the Father , to such goodness ( Which heaven be pleas 'd , I may inherit from you ) Than I shall ever of those specious titlesThat plead for my succession in the Earldom ( Did I possess it now ) left by my Mother .
I do believe it : but --
O my lov 'd Father , Before I knew you were so , by instinct , Nature had taught me , to look on your wants , Not as a stranger 's : and I know not how , What you call 'd charity , I thought the paymentOf some religious debt , nature stood bound for ; And last of all , when your magnificent bountyIn my low ebb of fortune , had brought inA flood of blessings , though my threatning wantsAnd fear of their effects , still kept me stupid , I soon found out , it was no common pityThat led you to it .
Think of this hereafterWhen we with joy may call it to remembrance , There will be a time , more opportune , than nowTo end our story , with all circumstances , I add this only : when we fled from WolfortI sent you into England , and there placed youWith a brave Flanders Merchant , call 'd rich Goswin , A man supplyed by me unto that purpose , As bound by oath never to discover you , Who dying , left his name and wealth unto youAs his reputed Son , and yet receiv 'd so ; But now , as Florez , and a Prince , rememberThe countreys , and the subjects general goodMust challenge the first part in your affection : The fair maid , whom you chose to be your wife , Being so far beneath you , that your loveMust grant she 's not your equal .
In descentOr borrowed glories from dead Ancestors , But for her beauty , chastity , and all vertuesEver remembred in the best of women , A Monarch might receive from her , not give , Though she were his Crowns purchase ; in this onlyBe an indulgent Father : in all else , Use your authority .
Hubert , Hemskirk , Wolfort , Bertha , and Souldiers .
Sir , here be two of 'em , The Father and the Son , the rest you shall haveAs fast as I can rouze them .
Who 's this ? Wolfort ?
I Criple , your feigned crutches will not help you , Nor patch 'd disguise that hath so long conceal 'd you , It 's now no halting : I must here find Gerrard , And in this Merchants habit , one call 'd FlorezWho would be an Earl .
And is , wert thou a subject .
Is this that Traitor Wolfort ?
Yes , but youAre they that are betrai 'd : Hemskirk .
My GoswinTurn 'd Prince ? O I am poorer by this greatness , Than all my former jealousies or misfortunes .
Gertrude ?
Stay Sir , you were to day too near her , You must no more aim at those easie accesses , Less you can do't in air , without a head , Which shall be suddenly tri 'd .
O take my heart , first , And since I can not hope now to enjoy him , Let me but fall a part of his glad ransom .
You know not your own value , that entreat .
So proud a fiend as Wolfort .
For so lostA thing as Florez .
And that would be soRather than she should stoop again to thee ; There is no death , but 's sweeter than all life , When Wolfort is to give it : O my Gertrude , It is not that , nor Princedom that I goe from , It is from thee , that loss includeth all .
I , if my young Prince knew his loss , he would say so , Which that he yet may chew on , I will tell himThis is no Gertrude , nor no Hemskirks Niece , Nor Vandunks Daughter : this is Bertha , Bertha , The heir of Brabant , she that caus 'd the war , Whom I did steal , during my treaty there , In your minority , to raise my self ; I then fore-seeing 'twould beget a quarel , That , a necessity of my employment , The same employment , make me master of strength , That strength , the Lord of Flanders , so of Brabant , By marrying her : which had not been to doe Sir , She come of years , but that the expectationFirst of her Fathers death , retarded it , And since the standing out of Bruges , where
had hid her , till she was near lost : But Sir , we have recover 'd her : your MerchantshipMay break , for this was one of your best bottomsI think .
Insolent Devil !

Who are these , Hemskirk ?
More , more , Sir .
How they triumph in their treachery !

Who , this ?
Yes this is Hubert , Wolfort , I hope he has helpt himself to a tree .

Can this be possible , Welcom my love , my sweet , my worthy love .
I ha ' giv'n you her twice : now keep her better , and thankLord Hubert , that came to me in Gerrards name , And got me out , with my brave Boyes , to marchLike Caesar , when he bred his Commentaries , So I , to bread my Chronicle , came forth
, & veni , vidi , vici , Give me my Bottle , and set down the drum ; You had your tricks Sir , had you ? we ha ' tricks too , You stole the Lady ?
And we led your Squadrons , Where they ha ' scratch 'd their leggs a little , with brambles , If not their faces .
Yes , and run their headsAgainst trees .
'T is Captain Prig , Sir .
And Coronel Higgen .
We have fill 'd a pit with your people , some with leggs , Some with arms broken , and a neck or twoI think be loose .
The rest too , that escap 'd , Are not yet out o'the briars,
And your horses , Sir , Are well set up in Bruges all by this time : You look as you were not well Sir , and would beShortly let blood ; do you want a scarf ?
A halter .
'T was like your self , honest , and noble Hubert : Can'st thou behold these mirrors all together , Of thy long , false , and bloody usurpation ? Thy tyrrannous proscription , and fresh treason : And not so see thy self , as to fall downAnd sinking , force a grave , with thine own guilt , As deep as hell , to cover thee and it ?
No , I can stand : and praise the toyles that took meAnd laughing in them dye , they were brave snares .
'Twere truer valour , if thou durst repentThe wrongs th ' hast done , and live .
Who , I repent ? And say I am sorry ? yes , 't is the fool 's languageAnd not for Wolfort .
Wolfort , thou art a Devil , And speakst his language , oh that I had my longingUnder this row of trees now would I hang him .
No let him live , until he can repent , But banish 'd from our State , that is thy doom .
Then hang his worthy Captain here , this HemskirkFor profit of th ' example .
No let himEnjoy his shame too : with his conscious life , To shew how much our innocence contemnsAll practice from the guiltiest , to molest us .

Sir , you must help to joinA pair of hands , as they have done their hearts here , And to their loves with joy .
As to mine own , My gracious Sister , worthiest Brother .
I'le go afore , and have the bon-fire made , My fire-works , & flap dragons , and good backrack , With a peck of little fishes , to drink downIn healths to this day .
'Slight , here be changes , The Bells ha ' not so many , nor a dance , Prig .
Our Company 's grown horrible thin by it , What think you Ferret ?
Marry I do think , That we might all be Lords now , if we could stand for't .
Not I if they should offer it : I'le dislodge first , Remove the Bush to another climat .
Sir , you must thank this worthy Burgomaster , Here be friends ask to be look 'd on too , And thank 'd , who though their trade , and course of lifeBe not so perfect , but it may be better 'd , Have yet us 'd me with courtesy , and been trueSubjects unto me , while I was their King , A place I know not well how to resign , Nor unto whom : But this I will entreatYour grace , command them follow you to Bruges ; Where I will take the care on me , to findSome manly , and more profitable courseTo fit them , as a part of the Republique .

To your good Lordship .
May you both live long .
Attend me at Van-dunks , the Burgomasters. [ Ex. all but Beggars .
Yes , to beat hemp , and be whipt twice a week , Or turn the wheel , for Crab the Rope-maker : Or learn to go along with him , his course ; That 's a fine course now , i ' the common-wealth , Prig , What say you to it ?
It is the backwardst course , I know i'the world .
Then Higgen will scarce thrive by it , You do conclude ?
'Faith hardly , very hardly .
Troth I am partly of your mind , Prince Prig ; And therefore farewel Flanders , Higgen will seekSome safer shelter , in some other Climat , With this his tatter 'd Colony : Let me see
, Ferret , Prig , and Higgen , all are leftO ' the true blood : what ? shall we into England ?
Agreed .
Then bear up bravely with your Brute my lads,
hath prig 'd the prancers in his dayes , And sold good penny-worths ; we will have a course , The Spirit of Bottom , is grown bottomless .
I'le mand no more , nor cant .
Yes , your sixpenny worthIn private , Brother , sixpence is a sumI'le steal you any mans Dogg for .

'T is right,
must practise , so must Prig to eat ; And write the Letter : and gi ' the word. But nowNo more , as either of these .
But as true Beggars , As e 're we were .
We stand here , for an Epilogue ; Ladies , your bounties first ; the rest will follow ; For womens favours are a leading alms , If you be pleas 'd look cheerly , throw your eyesOut at your masks .
And let your beauties sparkle .
So may you ne'er want dressings , Jewels , gownsStill i ' the fashion .
Nor the men you love , Wealth nor discourse to please you .
May you Gentlemen , Never want good fresh suits nor liberty .
May every Merchant here see safe his ventures .
And every honest Citizen his debts in .
The Lawyers again good Clyents .
And the Clyents good Counsel .
All the Gamesters here good fortune .
The Drunkards too good wine .
The eaters meatFit for their tastes and palats .
The good wives kind Husbands .
The young maids choyce of Sutors .
The Midwives merry hearts .
And all good cheer .

Now sweare him .
You are welcom Brother .
Welcom , welcom , welcom , but who shall have the keepingOf this fellow ?
Thank ye friends , And I beseech ye , if you dare but trust me ; For if I have kept wilde doggs and beastes for wonder , And made 'em tame too : give into my custodyThis roaring rascal I shall hamper him , With all his knacks and knaveryes , and I feare meDiscover yet a further villany in him ; O he smells ranck 'oth rascall .

So , now come in , But ever have an eye Sir , to your prisoner .
He must blinde both mine eyes , if he get from me .
Go , get some victualls , and some drink , some good drinkFor this day weele keep holly to good fortune , Come and be frollick with us .
O I am miserably lost , thus falneInto my uncles hands from all my hopes , Can I not thinke away my selfe and dye ? O I am miserably lost ; thus fallenInto my uncles hands , from all my hopes : No matter now , where thou be false or no,

Satyr .
Shepherd , with him four couple of Shepherds
Shepherdesses .
Now we have done this holy FestivalIn honour of our great God , and his ritesPerform 'd , prepare your selves for chasteAnd uncorrupted fires : that as the Priest , With powerful hand shall sprinkle on [ your ] BrowsHis pure and holy water , ye may beFrom all hot flames of lust , and loose thoughts free.Kneel Shepherds , kneel , here comes the Priest of Pan .
Priest .
Stay gentle Amoret , thou fair brow 'd Maid , Thy Shepherd prays thee stay , that holds thee dear , Equal with his souls good .
Speak ; I giveThee freedom Shepherd , and thy tongue be stillThe same it ever was ; as free from ill , As he whose conversation never knewThe Court or City be thou ever true .
When I fall off from my affection , Or mingle my clean thoughts with foul desires , First let our great God cease to keep my flocks , That being left alone without a guard , The Wolf , or Winters rage , Summers great heat , And want of Water , Rots ; or what to usOf ill is yet unknown , full speedily , And in their general ruine let me feel .
I pray thee gentle Shepherd wish not so , I do believe thee : 't is as hard for meTo think thee false , and harder than for theeTo hold me foul .
O you are fairer farThan the chaste blushing morn , or that fair starThat guides the wandring Sea-men through the deep , Straighter than straightest Pine upon the steepHead of an aged mountain , and more whiteThan the new Milk we strip before day-lightFrom the full fraighted bags of our fair flocks : Your hair more beauteous than those hanging locksOf young Apollo .
Shepherd be not lost , Y'are sail 'd too far already from the CoastOf our discourse .
Did you not tell me onceI should not love alone , I should not loseThose many passions , vows , and holy Oaths , I 've sent to Heaven ? did you not give your hand , Even that fair hand in hostage ? Do not thenGive back again those sweets to other men , You your self vow 'd were mine .
Shepherd , so far as Maidens modestyMay give assurance , I am once more thine , Once more I give my hand ; be ever freeFrom that great foe to faith , foul jealousie .
I take it as my best good , and desireFor stronger confirmation of our love , To meet this happy night in that fair Grove , Where all true Shepherds have rewarded beenFor their long service : say sweet , shall it hold ?
Dear friend , you must not blame me if I makeA doubt of what the silent night may do , Coupled with this dayes heat to move your bloud : Maids must be fearful ; sure you have not beenWash 'd white enough ; for yet I see a stainStick in your Liver , go and purge again .
Thou hast prevail 'd , farewel , this coming nightShall crown thy chast hopes with long wish 'd delight .
Our great god Pan reward thee for that goodThou hast given thy poor Shepherd : fairest BudOf Maiden Vertues , when I leave to beThe true Admirer of thy Chastitie , Let me deserve the hot polluted NameOf the wild Woodman , or affect : some Dame , Whose often Prostitution hath begotMore foul Diseases , than ever yet the hotSun bred through his burnings , whilst the DogPursues the raging Lion , throwing Fog , And deadly Vapour from his angry Breath , Filling the lower World with Plague and Death. [ Ex. Am .
Amaryllis .
Shepherd , may I desire to be believ 'd , What I shall blushing tell ?
Fair Maid , you may .
Then softly thus , I love thee , Perigot , And would be gladder to be lov 'd again , Than the cold Earth is in his frozen armsTo clip the wanton Spring : nay do not start , Nor wonder that I woo thee , thou that artThe prime of our young Grooms , even the topOf all our lusty Shepherds ! what dull eyeThat never was acquainted with desire , Hath seen thee wrastle , run , or cast the StoneWith nimble strength and fair delivery , And hath not sparkled fire , and speedilySent secret heat to all the neighbouring Veins ? Who ever heard thee sing , that brought againThat freedom back , was lent unto thy Voice ; Then do not blame me ( Shepherd ) if I beOne to be numbred in this Companie , Since none that ever saw thee yet , were free .
Fair Shepherdess , much pity I can lendTo your Complaints : but sure I shall not love : All that is mine , my self , and my best hopesAre given already ; do not love him thenThat can not love again : on other menBestow those heats more free , that may returnYou fire for fire , and in one flame equal burn .
Shall I rewarded be so slenderlyFor my affection , most unkind of men ! If I were old , or had agreed with ArtTo give another Nature to my Cheeks , Or were I common Mistress to the loveOf every Swain , or could I with such easeCall back my Love , as many a Wanton doth ; Thou might'st refuse me , Shepherd ; but to theeI am only fixt and set , let it not beA Sport , thou gentle Shepherd to abuseThe love of silly Maid .
Fair Soul , ye useThese words to little end : for know , I mayBetter call back that time was Yesterday , Or stay the coming Night , than bring my LoveHome to my self again , or recreant prove.I will no longer hold you with delays , This present night I have appointed beenTo meet that chaste Fair ( that enjoys my Soul ) In yonder Grove , there to make up our Loves.Be not deceiv 'd no longer , chuse again , These neighbouring Plains have many a comely Swain , Fresher , and freer far than I e'r was , Bestow that love on them , and let me pass.Farewel , be happy in a better Choice. [ Exit .
Shepherd .
Fresh Beauty , let me not be thought uncivil , Thus to be Partner of your loneness : 'twasMy Love ( that ever working passion ) drewMe to this place to seek some remedyFor my sick Soul : be not unkind and fair , For such the mighty Cupid in his doomHath sworn to be aveng 'd on ; then give roomTo my consuming Fires , that so I mayEnjoy my long Desires , and so allayThose flames that else would burn my life away .
Shepherd , were I but sure thy heart were soundAs thy words seem to be , means might be foundTo cure thee of thy long pains ; for to meThat heavy youth-consuming MiserieThe love-sick Soul endures , never was pleasing ; I could be well content with the quick easingOf thee , and thy hot fires , might it procureThy faith and farther service to be sure .
Name but that great work , danger , or what canBe compass 'd by the Wit or Art of Man , And if I fail in my performance , mayI never more kneel to the rising Day .
Then thus I try thee , Shepherd , this same night , That now comes stealing on , a gentle pairHave promis 'd equal Love , and do appointTo make yon Wood the place where hands and heartsAre to be ty 'd for ever : break their meetingAnd their strong Faith , and I am ever thine .
Tell me their Names , and if I do not move ( By my great power ) the Centre of their LoveFrom his fixt being , let me never moreWarm me by those fair Eyes I thus adore .
Come , as we go , I 'll tell thee what they are , And give thee fit directions for thy work. [ Exeunt .
Cloe .
How have I wrong 'd the times , or men , that thusAfter this holy Feast I pass unknownAnd unsaluted ? 't was not wont to beThus frozen with the younger companieOf jolly Shepherds ; 't was not then held good , For lusty Grooms to mix their quicker bloodWith that dull humour , most unfit to beThe friend of man , cold and dull Chastitie.Sure I am held not fair , or am too old , Or else not free enough , or from my foldDrive not a flock sufficient great , to gainThe greedy eyes of wealth-alluring Swain : Yet if I may believe what others say , My face has soil enough ; nor can they layJustly too strict a Coyness to my Charge ; My Flocks are many , and the Downs as largeThey feed upon : then let it ever beTheir Coldness , not my Virgin ModestieMakes me complain .
Thenot .
Was ever Man but IThus truly taken with uncertainty ? Where shall that Man be found that loves a mindMade up in Constancy , and dare not findHis Love rewarded ? here let all men knowA Wretch that lives to love his Mistress so .
Shepherd , I pray thee stay , where hast thou been ? Or whither go'st thou ? here be Woods as greenAs any , air likewise as fresh and sweet , As where smooth Zephyrus plays on the fleetFace of the curled Streams , with Flowers as manyAs the young Spring gives , and as choise as any ; Here be all new Delights , cool Streams and Wells , Arbors o'rgrown with Woodbinds , Caves , and Dells , Chase where thou wilt , whilst I sit by , and sing , Or gather Rushes to make many a RingFor thy long fingers ; tell thee tales of Love , How the pale Phoebe hunting in a Grove , First saw the Boy Endymion , from whose EyesShe took eternal fire that never dyes ; How she convey 'd him softly in a sleep , His temples bound with poppy to the steepHead of old Latmus , where she stoops each night , Gilding the Mountain with her Brothers light , To kiss her sweetest .
Far from me are theseHot flashes , bred from wanton heat and ease ; I have forgot what love and loving meant : Rhimes , Songs , and merry Rounds , that oft are sentTo the soft Ears of Maids , are strange to me ; Only I live t ' admire a Chastitie , That neither pleasing Age , smooth tongue , or Gold , Could ever break upon , so pure a MoldIs that her Mind was cast in ; 't is to herI only am reserv 'd ; she is my form I stirBy , breath and move , 't is she and only sheCan make me happy , or give miserie .
Good Shepherd , may a Stranger crave to knowTo whom this dear observance you do ow ?
You may , and by her Vertue learn to squareAnd level out your Life ; for to be fairAnd nothing vertuous , only fits the EyeOf gaudy Youth , and swelling Vanitie.Then know , she 's call 'd the Virgin of the Grove , She that hath long since bury 'd her chaste Love , And now lives by his Grave , for whose dear SoulShe hath vow 'd her self into the holy RollOf strict Virginity ; 't is her I so admire , Not any looser Blood , or new desire .
Farewel poor Swain , thou art not for my bend , I must have quicker Souls , whose works may tendTo some free action : give me him dare loveAt first encounter , and as soon dare prove.The SONG.Come Shepherds , come , Come away without delayWhilst the gentle time dot [ h ] stay.Green Woods are dumb , And will never tell to anyThose dear Kisses , and those manySweet Embraces that are givenDainty Pleasures that would evenRaise in coldest Age a fire , And give Virgin Blood desire , Then if ever , Now or never , Come and have it , Think not I , Dare deny , If you crave it .
I can love , But I am loth to say so , lest I proveToo soon unhappy .
Happy thou would'st say , My dearest Daphnis , blush not , if the dayTo thee and thy soft heats be enemie , Then take the coming Night , fair youth 't is freeTo all the World , Shepherd , I 'll meet thee thenWhen darkness hath shut up the eyes of men , In yonder Grove : speak , shall our Meeting hold ? Indeed you are too bashful , be more bold , And tell me I .
I 'm content to say so , And would be glad to meet , might I but pray soMuch from your Fairness , that you would be true .
Shepherd , thou hast thy Wish .
Fresh Maid , adieu : Yet one word more , since you have drawn me onTo come this Night , fear not to meet aloneThat man that will not offer to be ill , Though your bright self would ask it , for his fillOf this Worlds goodness : do not fear him then , But keep your 'pointed time ; let other menSet up their Bloods to sale , mine shall be everFair as the Soul it carries , and unchast never. [ Exit .
Yet am I poorer than I was before.Is it not strange , among so many a scoreOf lusty Bloods , I should pick out these thingsWhose Veins like a dull River far from Springs , Is still the same , slow , heavy , and unfitFor stream or motion , though the strong winds hitWith their continual power upon his sides ? O happy be your names that have been brides , And tasted those rare sweets for which I pine : And far more heavy be thy grief and time , Thou lazie swain , that maist relieve my needs , Than his , upon whose liver alwayes feedsA hungry vultur .
Alexis .
Can such beauty beSafe in his own guard , and not draw the eyeOf him that passeth on , to greedy gaze , Or covetous desire , whilst in a mazeThe better part contemplates , giving reinAnd wished freedom to the labouring vein ? Fairest and whitest , may I crave to knowThe cause of your retirement , why ye goeThus all alone ? methinks the downs are sweeter , And the young company of swains far meeter , Than those forsaken and untroden places.Give not your self to loneness , and those gracesHid from the eyes of men , that were intendedTo live amongst us swains .
Thou art befriended , Shepherd , in all my life I have not seenA man in whom greater contents have beenThan thou thy self art : I could tell thee more , Were there but any hope left to restoreMy freedom lost. O lend me all thy red , Thou shamefast morning , when from Tithons bedThou risest ever maiden .
If for me , Thou sweetest of all sweets , these flashes be , Speak and be satisfied. O guide her tongue , My better angel ; force my name amongHer modest thoughts , that the first word may be --
Alexis , when the sun shall kiss the Sea , Taking his rest by the white Thetis side , Meet in the holy wood , where I'le abideThy coming , Shepherd .
If I stay behind , An everlasting dulness , and the wind , That as he passeth by shuts up the streamOf Rhine or Volga , whilst the suns hot beamBeats back again , seise me , and let me turnTo coldness more than ice : oh how I burnAnd rise in youth and fire ! I dare not stay .
My name shall be your word .
Fly , fly thou day. [ Exit .
My grief is great if both these boyes should fail : He that will use all winds must shift his sail. [ Exit .
Shepherd , with a bell ringing , and the Priest of Panfollowing .
Clorin , the Shepherdess , sorting of herbs , and telling thenatures of them .
Thenot .
This is the Cabin where the best of allHer Sex , that ever breath 'd , or ever shallGive heat or happiness to the Shepherds side , Doth only to her worthy self abide.Thou blessed star , I thank thee for thy light , Thou by whose power the darkness of sad nightIs banisht from the Earth , in whose dull placeThy chaster beams play on the heavy faceOf all the world , making the blue Sea smile , To see how cunningly thou dost beguileThy Brother of his brightness , giving dayAgain from Chaos , whiter than that wayThat leads to Joves high Court , and chaster farThan chastity it self , yon blessed starThat nightly shines : Thou , all the constancieThat in all women was , or e 're shall be , From whose fair eye-balls flyes that holy fire , That Poets stile the Mother of desire , Infusing into every gentle brestA soul of greater price , and far more blestThan that quick power , which gives a difference , 'Twixt man and creatures of a lower sense .
Shepherd , how cam'st thou hither to this place ? No way is troden , all the verdant grassThe spring shot up , stands yet unbruised hereOf any foot , only the dapled DeerFar from the feared sound of crooked hornDwels in this fastness .
Chaster than the morn , I have not wandred , or by strong illusionInto this vertuous place have made intrusion : But hither am I come ( believe me fair ) To seek you out , of whose great good the airIs full , and strongly labours , whilst the soundBreaks against Heaven , and drives into a stoundThe amazed Shepherd , that such vertue canBe resident in lesser than a man .
If any art I have , or hidden skillMay cure thee of disease or festred ill , Whose grief or greenness to anothers eyeMay seem impossible of remedy , I dare yet undertake it .
'T is no painI suffer through disease , no beating veinConveyes infection dangerous to the heart , No part impostum 'd to be cur 'd by Art , This body holds ; and yet a feller griefThan ever skilfull hand did give reliefDwells on my soul , and may be heal 'd by you , Fair beauteous Virgin .
Then Shepherd , let me sueTo know thy grief ; that man yet never knewThe way to health , that durst not shew his sore .
Then fairest , know , I love you .
Swain , no more , Thou hast abus 'd the strictness of this place , And offred Sacrilegious foul disgraceTo the sweet rest of these interred bones , For fear of whose ascending , fly at once , Thou and thy idle passions , that the sightOf death and speedy vengeance may not frightThy very soul with horror .
Let me not ( Thou all perfection ) merit such a blotFor my true zealous faith .
Dar'st thou abideTo see this holy Earth at once divideAnd give her body up ? for sure it will , If thou pursu'st with wanton flames to fillThis hallowed place ; therefore repent and goe , Whilst I with praise appease his Ghost below , That else would tell thee what it were to beA rival in that vertuous love that heImbraces yet .
'T is not the white or redInhabits in your cheek that thus can wedMy mind to adoration ; nor your eye , Though it be full and fair , your forehead high , And smooth as Pelops shoulder ; not the smileLies watching in those dimples to beguileThe easie soul , your hands and fingers longWith veins inamel 'd richly , nor your tongue , Though it spoke sweeter than Arions Harp , Your hair wove into many a curious warp , Able in endless errour to infoldThe wandring soul , nor the true perfect mouldOf all your body , which as pure doth showIn Maiden whiteness as the Alpsian snow.All these , were but your constancie away , Would please me less than a black stormy dayThe wretched Seaman toyling through the deep.But whilst this honour 'd strictness you dare keep , Though all the plagues that e 're begotten wereIn the great womb of air , were setled here , In opposition , I would , like the tree , Shake off those drops of weakness , and be freeEven in the arm of danger .
Wouldst thou haveMe raise again ( fond man ) from silent grave , Those sparks that long agoe were buried here , With my dead friends cold ashes ?
Dearest dear , I dare not ask it , nor you must not grant ; Stand strongly to your vow , and do not faint : Remember how he lov 'd ye , and be stillThe same Opinion speaks ye ; let not will , And that great god of women , appetite , Set up your blood again ; do not inviteDesire and fancie from their long exile , To set them once more in a pleasing smile : Be like a rock made firmly up 'gainst allThe power of angry Heaven , or the strong fallOf Neptunes battery ; if ye yield , I dieTo all affection ; 't is that loyaltieYe tie unto this grave I so admire ; And yet there 's something else I would desire , If you would hear me , but withall deny.O Pan , what an uncertain destinyHangs over all my hopes ! I will retire , For if I longer stay , this double fireWill lick my life up .
Doe , let time wear outWhat Art and Nature can not bring about .
Farewel thou soul of vertue , and be blestFor ever , whilst that here I wretched restThus to my self ; yet grant me leave to dwellIn kenning of this Arbor ; yon same dellO'retopt with morning Cypress and sad YewShall be my Cabin , where I'le early rew , Before the Sun hath kist this dew away , The hard uncertain chance which Fate doth layUpon this head .
The gods give quick releaseAnd happy cure unto thy hard disease. [ Exeunt .
Sullen Shepherd .
I do not love this wench that I should meet , For ne'r did my unconstant eye yet greetThat beauty , were it sweeter or more fair , Than the new blossoms , when the morning airBlows gently on the [ m ] , or the breaking light , When many maiden blushes to our sightShoot from his early face : were all these setIn some neat form before me , 'twould not getThe least love from me ; some desire it might , Or present burning : all to me in sightAre equal , be they fair , or black , or brown , Virgin , or careless wanton , I can crownMy appetite with any ; swear as oftAnd weep , as any , melt my words as softInto a maiden [ s ] ears , and tell how longMy heart has been her servant , and how strongMy passions are : call her unkind and cruel , Offer her all I have to gain the JewelMaidens so highly prize : then loath , and fly : This do I hold a blessed destiny .
Amaryllis .
Hail Shepherd , Pan bless both thy flock and thee , For being mindful of thy word to me .
Lov 'd swain , I thank ye , these tricks might prevailWith other rustick Shepherds , but will failEven once to stir , much more to overthrowHis fixed love from judgement , who doth knowYour nature , my end , and his chosens merit ; Therefore some stranger way must force his spirit , Which I have found : give second , and my loveIs everlasting thine .
Try me and prove .
And if I fit thee not , then fit not me : I long the truth of this wells power to see. [ Exeunt .
Here will I stay , for this the covert isWhere I appointed Cloe ; do not miss , Thou bright-ey 'd virgin , come , O come my fair , Be not abus 'd with fear , nor let cold careOf honour stay thee from the Shepherds arm , Who would as hard be won to offer harmTo thy chast thoughts , as whiteness from the day , Or yon great round to move another way.My language shall be honest , full of truth , My flames as smooth and spotless as my youth : I will not entertain that wandring thought , Whose easie current may at length be broughtTo a loose vastness .
Cloe !
'T is her voyce , And I must answer , Cloe ! Oh the choiceOf dear embraces , chast and holy strainsOur hands shall give ! I charge you all my veinsThrough which the blood and spirit take their way , Lock up your disobedient heats , and stayThose mutinous desires that else would growTo strong rebellion : do not wilder showThan blushing modesty may entertain .
Cloe !
There sounds that [ blessed ] name again,
Alexis.And I will meet it : let me not mistake , This is some Shepherd ! sure I am awake ; What may this riddle mean ? I will retire , To give my self more knowledg .
Oh my fire , How thou consum'st me ! Cloe , answer me,
, strong Alexis , high and free , Calls upon Cloe. See mine arms are fullOf entertainment , ready for to pullThat golden fruit which too too long hath hungTempting the greedy eye : thou stayest too long , I am impatient of these mad delayes ; I must not leave unsought these many waysThat lead into this center , till I findQuench for my burning lust. I come , unkind. [ Exit Alexis .
Can my imagination work me so much ill , That I may credit this for truth , and stillBelieve mine eyes ? or shall I firmly holdHer yet untainted , and these sights but boldIllusion ? Sure such fancies oft have beenSent to abuse true love , and yet are seen , Daring to blind the vertuous thought with errour.But be they far from me with their fond terrour : I am resolv 'd my Cloe yet is true. [ Cloe within .
, hark , Cloe : Sure this voyce is new , Whose shrilness like the sounding of a Bell , Tells me it is a Woman : Cloe , tellThy blessed name again. Cloe. [ within ] Here.Oh what a grief is this to be so near , And not incounter !
Cloe .
Shepherd , we are met , Draw close into the covert , lest the wetWhich falls like lazy mists upon the groundSoke through your Startups .
Honest Swain , First let me thank you , then return againAs much of my love : no thou art too cold , Unhappy Boy , not tempred to my mold , Thy blood falls heavy downward , 't is not fearTo offend in boldness wins , they never wearDeserved favours that deny to takeWhen they are offered freely : Do I wakeTo see a man of his youth , years and feature , And such a one as we call goodly creature , Thus backward ? What a world of precious ArtWere meerly lost , to make him do his part ? But I will shake him off , that dares not hold , Let men that hope to be belov 'd be bold .
, I do desire , since we are metSo happily , our lives and fortunes setUpon one stake , to give assurance now , By interchange of hands and holy vow , Never to break again : walk you that wayWhilest I in zealous meditation strayA little this way : when we both have endedThese rites and duties , by the woods befriended , And secrecie of night , retire and findAn aged Oak , whose hollowness may bindUs both within his body , thither go , It stands within yon bottom .
Be it so. [ Ex. Daph .
And I will meet there never more with thee , Thou idle shamefastness .
'T is heThat dare I hope be bolder .
NowGreat Pan for Syrinx sake bid speed our Plow. [ Exit Cloe .
Sullen Shepherd with Amaryllis in a sleep .
From thy forehead thus I takeThese herbs , and charge thee not awakeTill in yonder holy Well , Thrice with powerful Magick spell , Fill 'd with many a baleful word , Thou hast been dipt ; thus with my cordOf blasted Hemp , by Moon-light twin 'd , I do thy sleepy body bind ; I turn thy head into the East , And thy feet into the West , Thy left arm to the South put forth , And thy right unto the North : I take thy body from the ground , In this deep and deadly swound , And into this holy springI let thee slide down by my string.Take this Maid thou holy pit , To thy bottom , nearer yet , In thy water pure and sweet , By thy leave I dip her feet ; Thus I let her lower yet , That her ankles may be wet ; Yet down lower , let her kneeIn thy waters washed be ; There stop : Fly awayEvery thing that loves the day.Truth that hath but one face , Thus I charm thee from this place.Snakes that cast your coats for new , Camelions that alter hue , Hares that yearly Sexes change,
alt'ring oft and strange,
with shapes three , Let this Maiden changed be , With this holy water wet , To the shape of Amoret:
work thou with my charm , Thus I draw thee free from harmUp out of this blessed Lake , Rise both like her and awake. [ She awakes .
Speak Shepherd , am I Amoret to sight ? Or hast thou mist in any Magick rite ; For want of which any defect in me , May make our practices discovered be .
By yonder Moon , but that I here do stand , Whose breath hath thus transform 'd thee , and whose handLet thee down dry , and pluckt thee up thus wet , I should my self take thee for Amoret ; Thou art in cloths , in feature , voice and hewSo like , that sense can not distinguish you .
Then this deceit which can not crossed be , At once shall lose her him , and gain thee me.Hither she needs must come by promise made , And sure his nature never was so bad , To bid a Virgin meet him in the wood , When night and fear are up , but understood , 'T was his part to come first : being come , I'le say , My constant love made me come first and stay , Then will I lead him further to the grove , But stay you here , and if his own true loveShall seek him here , set her in some wrong path , Which say , her lover lately troden hath ; I'le not be far from hence , if need there be , Here is another charm , whose power will freeThe dazeled sense , read by the Moons beams clear , And in my own true map make me appear .
Perigot .
Stand close , here 's Perigot , whose constant heartLongs to behold her in whose shape thou art .
This is the place ( fair Amoret ) the hourIs yet scarce come : Here every Sylvan powerDelights to be about yon sacred Well , Which they have blest with many a powerful Spell ; For never Traveller in dead of Night , Nor strayed Beasts have faln in , but when sightHath fail 'd them , then their right way they have foundBy help of them , so holy is the ground : But I will farther seek , lest AmoretShould be first come , and so stray long unmet.My Amoret , Amoret. [ Ex. Amaryllis , Perigot .
My Love .
I come my Love. [ Exit .
Now she has gotHer own desires , and I shall gainer beOf my long lookt for hopes as well as she.How bright the moon shines here , as if she stroveTo show her Glory in this little Grove,
Amoret.To some new loved Shepherd. Yonder isAnother Amoret. Where differs thisFrom that ? but that she Perigot hath met , I should have ta'n this for the counterfeit : Herbs , Woods , and Springs , the power that in you lies , If mortal men could know your Properties !
Methinks it is not Night , I have no fear , Walking this Wood , of Lions , or the Bear , Whose Names at other times have made me quake , When any Shepherdess in her tale spakeOf some of them , that underneath a WoodHave torn true Lovers that together stood.Methinks there are no Goblins , and mens talk , That in these Woods the nimble Fairies walk , Are fables ; such a strong heart I have got , Because I come to meet with Perigot.My Perigot ! who 's that , my Perigot ?
Fair maid .
Ay me , thou art not Perigot .
But I can tell ye news of Perigot : An hour together under yonder treeHe sate with wreathed arms and call 'd on thee , And said , why Amoret stayest thou so long ? Then starting up , down yonder path he flung , Lest thou hadst miss 'd thy way : were it day light , He could not yet have born him out of sight .
Thanks , gentle Shepherd , and beshrew my stay , That made me fearful I had lost my way : As fast as my weak Legs ( that can not beWeary with seeking him ) will carry me , I 'll seek him out ; and for thy CourtesiePray Pan thy Love may ever follow thee. [ Exit .
How bright she was , how lovely did she show ! Was it not pity to deceive her so ? She pluckt her Garments up , and tript away , And with her Virgin-innocence did prayFor me that perjur 'd her. Whilst she was here , Methought the Beams of Light that did appearWere shot from her ; methought the Moon gave none , But what it had from her : she was aloneWith me , if then her presence did so move , Why did not I essay to win her Love ? She would not sure have yielded unto me ; Women love only Opportunitie , And not the Man ; or if she had deny 'd , Alone , I might have forc 'd her to have try'dWho had been stronger : O vain Fool , to letSuch blest Occasion pass ; I 'll follow yet , My Blood is up , I can not now forbear .
Alex , and Cloe.I come sweet Amoret : Soft who is here ? A pair of Lovers ? He shall yield her me ; '' Now Lust is up , alike all Women be .
Where shall we rest ? but for the love of me,
, I know ere this would weary be .
Alexis , let us rest here , if the placeBe private , and out of the common traceOf every Shepherd : for I understoodThis Night a number are about the Wood : Then let us chuse some place , where out of sightWe freely may enjoy our stoln delight .
Then boldly here , where we shall ne 're be found , No Shepherds way lies here , 't is hallow 'd ground : No Maid seeks here her strayed Cow , or Sheep , Fairies , and Fawns , and Satyrs do it keep : Then carelesly rest here , and clip and kiss , And let no fear make us our pleasures miss .
Then lye by me , the sooner we begin , The longer ere the day descry our sin .
Forbear to touch my Love , or by yon flame , The greatest power that Shepherds dare to name , Here where thou sit'st under this holy treeHer to dishonour , thou shalt buried be .
If Pan himself , should come out of the lawns , With all his Troops of Satyrs and of Fawns , And bid me leave , I swear by her two eyes , A greater Oath than thine , I would not rise .
Then from the cold Earth never shalt thou move , But lose at one stroke both thy Life and Love .
Hold gentle Shepherd .
Fairest Shepherdess , Come you with me , I do not love you lessThan that fond man , that would have kept you thereFrom me of more desert .
O yet forbearTo take her from me ; give me leave to dyeBy her. [ The Satyr enters , he runs one way , and she another .
Now whilst the Moon doth rule the Skie , And the Stars , whose feeble lightGive a pale Shadow to the night , Are up , great Pan commanded meTo walk this Grove about , whilst heIn a corner of the Wood , Where never mortal foot hath stood , Keeps dancing , musick , and a feastTo entertain a lovely Guest , Where he gives her many a Rose , Sweeter than the breath that blowsThe leaves ; Grapes , Berries of the best , I never saw so great a feast.But to my Charge : here must I stay , To see what mortals lose their way , And by a false fire seeming bright , Train them in and leave them right.Then must I watch if any beForcing of a Chastitie : If I find it , then in hasteGive my wreathed horn a Blast , And the Fairies all will run , Wildly dancing by the Moon , And will pinch him to the bone , Till his lustful thoughts be gone .
O Death !
Back again about this ground , Sure I hear a mortal sound ; I bind thee by this powerful Spell , By the Waters of this Well , By the glimmering Moon beams bright , Speak again , thou mortal wight .
Oh !
Here the foolish mortal lies , Sleeping on the ground : arise.The poor wight is almost dead , On the ground his wounds have bled , And his cloaths foul 'd with his blood : To my Goddess in the WoodWill I lead him , whose hands pure , Will help this mortal wight to cure .
Cloe again .
Sullen Shepherd .
This was the place , 't was but my feeble sight , Mixt with the horrour of my deed , and night , That shap't these fears , and made me run away , And lose my beauteous hardly gotten prey.Speak gentle Shepherdess , I am alone , And tender love for love : but she is goneFrom me , that having struck her Lover dead , For silly fear left her alone and fled.And see the wounded body is remov'dBy her of whom it was so well belov 'd .
Perigot and Amaryllis in the shape of Amoret.But these fancies must be quite forgot , I must lye close. Here comes young PerigotWith subtile Amaryllis in the shapeOf Amoret. Pray Love he may not 'scape .
Beloved Perigot , shew me some place , Where I may rest my limbs , weak with the ChaceOf thee , an hour before thou cam'st at least .
Beshrew my tardy steps : here shalt thou restUpon this holy bank , no deadly SnakeUpon this turf her self in folds doth make.Here is no poyson for the Toad to feed ; Here boldly spread thy hands , no venom 'd WeedDares blister them , no slimy Snail dare creepOver thy face when thou art fast asleep ; Here never durst the babling Cuckow spit , No slough of falling Star did ever hitUpon this bank : let this thy Cabin be , This other set with Violets for me .
Thou dost not love me Perigot .
Fair maid , You only love to hear it often said ; You do not doubt .
Believe me but I do .
What shall we now begin again to woo ? 'T is the best way to make your Lover last , To play with him , when you have caught him fast .
By Pan I swear , I loved Perigot , And by yon Moon , I think thou lov'st me not .
By Pan I swear , and if I falsely swear , Let him not guard my flocks , let Foxes tearMy earliest Lambs , and Wolves whilst I do sleepFall on the rest , a Rot among my Sheep.I love thee better than the careful EweThe new-yean 'd Lamb that is of her own hew ; I dote upon thee more than the young LambDoth on the bag that feeds him from his Dam.Were there a sort of Wolves got in my Fold , And one ran after thee , both young and oldShould be devour 'd , and it should be my strifeTo save thee , whom I love above my life .
How shall I trust thee when I see thee chuseAnother Bed , and dost my side refuse ?
'T was only that the chast thoughts might be shewn'Twixt thee and me , although we were alone .
Come , Perigot will shew his power , that heCan make his Amoret , though she weary be , Rise nimbly from her Couch , and come to his.Here take thy Amoret , embrace and kiss .
What means my Love ?
To do as lovers shou 'd , That are to be enjoy 'd , not to be woo'd.There 's ne'r a Shepherdess in all the plainCan kiss thee with more Art , there 's none can feignMore wanton tricks .
Forbear , dear Soul , to trieWhether my Heart be pure ; I 'll rather dieThan nourish one thought to dishonour thee .
Still think'st thou such a thing as ChastitieIs amongst Women ? Perigot there 's none , That with her Love is in a Wood alone , And would come home a maid ; be not abus'dWith thy fond first Belief , let time be us 'd : Why dost thou rise ?
My true heart thou hast slain .
Faith Perigot , I 'll pluck thee down again .
Let go , thou Serpent , that into my brestHast with thy cunning div 'd ; art not in Jest ?
Sweet love , lye down .
Since this I live to see , Some bitter North-wind blast my flocks and me .
You swore you lov 'd , yet will not do my will .
O be as thou wert once , I 'll love thee still .
I am , as still I was , and all my kind , Though other shows we have poor men to blind .
Then here I end all Love , and lest my vainBelief should ever draw me in again , Before thy face that hast my Youth misled , I end my life , my blood be on thy head .
O hold thy hands , thy Amoret doth cry .
Thou counsel'st well , first Amoret shall dye , That is the cause of my eternal smart. [ He runs after her .
O hold .
This steel shall pierce thy lustful heart. [ The Sullen Shepherd steps out and uncharms her .
Up and down every where , I strew the herbs to purge the air : Let your Odour drive henceAll mists that dazel sence.Herbs and Springs whose hidden mightAlters Shapes , and mocks the sight , Thus I charge you to undoAll before I brought ye to : Let her flye , let her 'scape , Give again her own shape .
Amaryllis in her own shape .
Forbear thou gentle Swain , thou dost mistake , She whom thou follow'dst fled into the brake , And as I crost thy way , I met thy wrath , The only fear of which near slain me hath .
Pardon fair Shepherdess , my rage and nightWere both upon me , and beguil 'd my sight ; But far be it from me to spill the bloodOf harmless Maids that wander in the Wood. [ Ex. Ama .
Amoret .
Many a weary step in yonder pathPoor hopeless Amoret twice trodden hathTo seek her Perigot , yet can not hearHis Voice ; my Perigot , she loves thee dearThat calls .
See yonder where she is , how fairShe shows , and yet her breath infefts the air .
My Perigot .
Here .
Happy .
Hapless first : It lights on thee , the next blow is the worst .
Stay Perigot , my love , thou art unjust .
Death is the best reward that 's due to lust. [ Exit Perigot .
Now shall their love be crost , for being struck , I'le throw her in the Fount , lest being tookBy some night-travaller , whose honest careMay help to cure her. Shepherdess prepareYour self to die .
No Mercy I do crave , Thou canst not give a worse blow than I have ; Tell him that gave me this , who lov 'd him too , He struck my soul , and not my body through , Tell him when I am dead , my soul shall beAt peace , if he but think he injur 'd me .
In this Fount be thy grave , thou wert not meantSure for a woman , thou art so innocent. [ flings her into the wellShe can not scape , for underneath the ground , In a long hollow the clear spring is bound , Till on yon side where the Morns Sun doth look , The strugling water breaks out in a Brook. [ Exit. [ The God of the River riseth with Amoret in his arms .
Who hath restor 'd my sense , given me new breath , And brought me back out of the arms of death ?
I have heal 'd thy wounds .
Ay me !
Fear not him that succour 'd thee : I am this Fountains god ; below , My waters to a River grow , And 'twixt two banks with Osiers set , That only prosper in the wet , Through the Meadows do they glide , Wheeling still on every side , Sometimes winding round about , To find the evenest channel out.And if thou wilt go with me , Leaving mortal companie , In the cool streams shalt thou lye , Free from harm as well as I : I will give thee for thy food , No Fish that useth in the mud , But Trout and Pike that love to swimWhere the gravel from the brimThrough the pure streams may be seen : Orient Pearl fit for a Queen , Will I give thy love to win , And a shell to keep them in : Not a Fish in all my BrookThat shall disobey thy look , But when thou wilt , come sliding by , And from thy white hand take a fly.And to make thee understand , How I can my waves command , They shall bubble whilst I singSweeter than the silver spring .
Do not fear to put thy feetNaked in the River sweet ; Think not Leach , or Newt or ToadWill bite thy foot , when thou hast troad ; Nor let the water rising high , As thou wad'st in , make thee crieAnd sob , but ever live with me , And not a wave shall trouble thee .
Immortal power , that rul'st this holy flood , I know my self unworthy to be woo'dBy thee a god : for e 're this , but for theeI should have shown my weak Mortalitie : Besides , by holy Oath betwixt us twain , I am betroath 'd unto a Shepherd swain , Whose comely face , I know the gods aboveMay make me leave to see , but not to love .
May he prove to thee as true.Fairest Virgin , now adieu , I must make my waters fly , Lest they leave their Channels dry , And beasts that come unto the springMiss their mornings watering , Which I would not ; for of lateAll the neighbour people sateOn my banks , and from the fold , Two white Lambs of three weeks oldOffered to my Deitie : For which this year they shall be freeFrom raging floods , that as they passLeave their gravel in the grass : Nor shall their Meads be overflown , When their grass is newly mown .
For thy kindness to me shown , Never from thy banks be blownAny tree , with windy force , Cross thy streams , to stop thy course : May no beast that comes to drink , With his horns cast down thy brink ; May none that for thy fish do look , Cut thy banks to damm thy Brook ; Bare-foot may no Neighbour wadeIn thy cool streams , wife nor maid , When the spawns on stones do lye , To wash their Hemp , and spoil the Fry .
Thanks Virgin , I must down again , Thy wound will put thee to no pain : Wonder not so soon 't is gone : A holy hand was laid upon .
And I unhappy born to be , Must follow him that flies from me .
Perigot .
She is untrue , unconstant , and unkind , She 's gone , she 's gone , blow high thou North-west wind , And raise the Sea to Mountains , let the TreesThat dare oppose thy raging fury , leeseTheir firm foundation , creep into the Earth , And shake the world , as at the monstrous birthOf some new Prodigy , whilst I constant stand , Holding this trustie Boar-spear in my hand , And falling thus upon it .
Amaryllis , running .
Stay thy dead-doing hand , thou art too hotAgainst thy self , believe me comely Swain , If that thou dyest , not all the showers of RainThe heavy clods send down can wash awayThat foul unmanly guilt , the world will layUpon thee. Yet thy love untainted stands : Believe me , she is constant , not the sandsCan be so hardly numbred as she won : I do not trifle , Shepherd , by the Moon , And all those lesser lights our eyes do view , All that I told thee Perigot , is true : Then be a free man , put away despair , And will to dye , smooth gently up that fairDejected forehead : be as when those eyesTook the first heat .
Alas he double dyes , That would believe , but can not ; 't is not wellYe keep me thus from dying , here to dwellWith many worse companions : but oh death , I am not yet inamour 'd of this breathSo much , but I dare leave it , 't is not painIn forcing of a wound , nor after gainOf many dayes , can hold me from my will : 'T is not my self , but Amoret , bids kill .
Stay but a little , little , but one hour , And if I do not show thee through the powerOf herbs and words I have , as dark as night , My self turn 'd to thy Amoret , in sight , Her very figure , and the Robe she wears , With tawny Buskins , and the hook she bearsOf thine own Carving , where your names are set , Wrought underneath with many a curious fret , The Prim-Rose Chaplet , taudry-lace and Ring , Thou gavest her for her singing , with each thingElse that she wears about her , let me feelThe first fell stroke of that Revenging steel .
I am contented , if there be a hopeTo give it entertainment , for the scopeOf one poor hour ; goe , you shall find me nextUnder yon shady Beech , even thus perplext , And thus believing .
Bind before I goe , Thy soul by Pan unto me , not to doeHarm or outragious wrong upon thy life , Till my return .
By Pan , and by the strifeHe had with Phoebus for the Mastery , When Golden Midas judg 'd their Minstrelcy , I will not. [ Exeunt .
Satyr , with Alexis , hurt .
What art thou call'st me from my holy rites , And with thy feared name of death affrightsMy tender Ears ? speak me thy name and will .
I am the Satyr that did fillYour lap with early fruit , and will , When I hap to gather more , Bring ye better and more store : Yet I come not empty now , See a blossom from the bow , But beshrew his heart that pull 'd it , And his perfect sight that cull 'd itFrom the other springing blooms ; For a sweeter youth the GroomsCannot show me , nor the downs , Nor the many neighbouring towns ; Low in yonder glade I found him , Softly in mine Arms I bound him , Hither have I brought him sleepingIn a trance , his wounds fresh weeping , In remembrance such youth maySpring and perish in a day .
Satyr , they wrong thee , that do term thee rude , Though thou beest outward rough and tawny hu 'd , Thy manners are as gentle and as fairAs his , who brags himself , born only heirTo all Humanity : let me see the wound : This Herb will stay the current being boundFast to the Orifice , and this restrainUlcers , and swellings , and such inward pain , As the cold air hath forc 'd into the sore : This to draw out such putrifying goreAs inward falls .
Heaven grant it may doe good .
Fairly wipe away the blood : Hold him gently till I flingWater of a vertuous springOn his temples ; turn him twiceTo the Moon beams , pinch him thrice , That the labouring soul may drawFrom his great eclipse .
I sawHis eye-lids moving .
Give him breath , All the danger of cold deathNow is vanisht ; with this Plaster , And this unction , do I masterAll the festred ill that mayGive him grief another day .
See he gathers up his sprightAnd begins to hunt for light ; Now he gapes and breaths again : How the blood runs to the vein , That erst was empty !
O my heart , My dearest , dearest Cloe , O the smartRuns through my side : I feel some pointed thingPass through my Bowels , sharper than the stingOf Scorpion.Pan preserve me , what are you ? Do not hurt me , I am trueTo my Cloe , though she flye , And leave me to thy destiny.There she stands , and will not lendHer smooth white hand to help her friend : But I am much mistaken , for that faceBears more Austerity and modest grace , More reproving and more aweThan these eyes yet ever sawIn my Cloe. Oh my painEagerly renews again.Give me your help for his sake you love best .
Shepherd , thou canst not possibly take rest , Till thou hast laid aside all hearts desiresProvoking thought that stir up lusty fires , Commerce with wanton eyes , strong blood , and willTo execute , these must be purg 'd , untillThe vein grow whiter ; then repent , and prayGreat Pan to keep you from the like decay , And I shall undertake your cure with ease.Till when this vertuous Plaster will displeaseYour tender sides ; give me your hand and rise : Help him a little Satyr , for his thighsYet are feeble .
Sure I have lost much blood .
'T is no matter , 't was not good.Mortal you must leave your wooing , Though there be a joy in doing , Yet it brings much grief behind it , They best feel it , that do find it .
Come bring him in , I will attend his soreWhen you are well , take heed you lust no more .
Shepherd , see what comes of kissing , By my head 'twere better missing.Brightest , if there be remainingAny service , without feigningI will do it ; were I setTo catch the nimble wind , or getShadows gliding on the green , Or to steal from the great QueenOf Fayries , all her beauty , I would do it , so much dutyDo I owe those precious Eyes .
I thank thee honest Satyr , if the cryesOf any other that be hurt or ill , Draw thee unto them , prithee do thy willTo bring them hither .
I will , and when the weatherServes to Angle in the brook , I will bring a silver hook , With a line of finest silk , And a rod as white as milk , To deceive the little fish : So I take my leave , and wish , On this Bower may ever dwellSpring , and Summer .
Friend farewel. [ Exit .
Amoret , seeking her Love .
Amaryllis .
I am not blind , Nor is it through the working of my mind , That this shows Amoret ; forsake me allThat dwell upon the soul , but what men callWonder , or more than wonder , miracle , For sure so strange as this the OracleNever gave answer of , it passeth dreams , Or mad-mens fancy , when the many streamsOf new imaginations rise and fall : 'T is but an hour since these Ears heard her callFor pity to young Perigot ; whilest he , Directed by his fury bloodilyLanc't up her brest , which bloodless fell and cold ; And if belief may credit what was told , After all this , the Melancholy SwainTook her into his arms being almost slain , And to the bottom of the holy wellFlung her , for ever with the waves to dwell.'Tis she , the very same , 't is Amoret , And living yet , the great powers will not letTheir vertuous love be crost. Maid , wipe awayThose heavy drops of sorrow , and allayThe storm that yet goes high , which not deprest , Breaks heart and life , and all before it rest : Thy Perigot --
Where , which is Perigot ?
Sits there below , lamenting much , god wot , Thee [ and thy ] fortune , go and comfort him , And thou shalt find him underneath a brimOf sailing Pines that edge yon Mountain in .
I go , I run , Heaven grant me I may winHis soul again. [ Exit Amoret .
Sullen .
Stay Amaryllis , stay , Ye are too fleet , 't is two hours yet to day.I have perform 'd my promise , let us sitAnd warm our bloods together till the fitCome lively on us .
Friend you are too keen , The morning riseth and we shall be seen , Forbear a little .
I can stay no longer .
Hold Shepherd hold , learn not to be a wrongerOf your word , was not your promise laid , To break their loves first ?
I have done it Maid .
No , they are yet unbroken , met again , And are as hard to part yet as the stainIs from the finest Lawn .
I say they areNow at this present parted , and so far , That they shall never meet .
Swain 't is not so , For do but to yon hanging Mountain go , And there believe your eyes .
You do but holdOff with delayes and trifles ; farewell coldAnd frozen bashfulness , unfit for men ; Thus I salute thee Virgin .
And thus then , I bid you follow , catch me if you can. [ Exit .
And if I stay behind I am no man. [ Exit running after her .
Perigot .
Night do not steal away : I woo thee yetTo hold a hard hand o 're the rusty bitThat guides the lazy Team : go back again,
, thou that driv'st thy frozen WainRound as a Ring , and bring a second NightTo hide my sorrows from the coming light ; Let not the eyes of men stare on my face , And read my falling , give me some black placeWhere never Sun-beam shot his wholesome light , That I may sit and pour out my sad sprightLike running water , never to be knownAfter the forced fall and sound is gone .
Amoret looking for Perigot .
This is the bottom : speak if thou be here , My Perigot , thy Amoret , thy dearCalls on thy loved Name .
What art thou [ dare ] Tread these forbidden paths , where death and careDwell on the face of darkness ?
'T is thy friend , Thy Amoret , come hither to give endTo these consumings ; look up gentle Boy , I have forgot those Pains and dear annoyI suffer 'd for thy sake , and am contentTo be thy love again ; why hast thou rentThose curled locks , where I have often hungRiband and Damask-roses , and have flungWaters distil 'd to make thee fresh and gay , Sweeter than the Nosegayes on a Bridal day ? Why dost thou cross thine Arms , and hang thy faceDown to thy bosom , letting fall apaceFrom those two little Heavens upon the groundShowers of more price , more Orient , and more roundThan those that hang upon the Moons pale brow ? Cease these complainings , Shepherd , I am nowThe same I ever was , as kind and free , And can forgive before you ask of me.Indeed I can and will .
So spoke my fair.O you great working powers of Earth and Air , Water and forming fire , why have you lentYour hidden vertues of so ill intent ? Even such a face , so fair , so bright of hueHad Amoret ; such words so smooth and new , Came flying from her tongue ; such was her eye , And such the pointed sparkle that did flyeForth like a bleeding shaft ; all is the same , The Robe and Buskins , painted Hook , and frameOf all her Body. O me , Amoret !
Shepherd , what means this Riddle ? who hath setSo strong a difference 'twixt my self and meThat I am grown another ? look and seeThe Ring thou gav'st me , and about my wristThat curious Bracelet thou thy self didst twistFrom those fair Tresses : knowst thou Amoret ? Hath not some newer love forc 'd thee forgetThy Ancient faith ?
Still nearer to my love ; These be the very words she oft did proveUpon my temper , so she still would takeWonder into her face , and silent makeSigns with her head and hand , as who would say , Shepherd remember this another day .
Am I not Amaret ? where was I lost ? Can there be Heaven , and time , and men , and mostOf these unconstant ? Faith where art thou fled ? Are all the vows and protestations dead , The hands [ held ] up , the wishes , and the heart , Is there not one remaining , not a partOf all these to be found ? why then I seeMen never knew that vertue Constancie .
Men ever were most blessed , till crass fateBrought Love and Women forth , unfortunateTo all that ever tasted of their smiles , Whose actions are all double , full of wiles : Like to the subtil Hare , that 'fore the HoundsMakes many turnings , leaps and many rounds , This way and that way , to deceive the scentOf her pursuers .
'T is but to preventTheir speedy coming on that seek her fall , The hands of cruel men , more Bestial , And of a nature more refusing goodThan Beasts themselves , or Fishes of the Flood .
Thou art all these , and more than nature meant , When she created all , frowns , joys , content ; Extream fire for an hour , and presentlyColder than sleepy poyson , or the Sea , Upon whose face sits a continual frost : Your actions ever driven to the most , Then down again as low , that none can findThe rise or falling of a Womans mind .
Thou art not worthy of that blessed name , I must not know thee , fling thy wanton flameUpon some lighter blood , that may be hotWith words and feigned passions : PerigotWas ever yet unstain 'd , and shall not nowStoop to the meltings of a borrowed brow .
Thou must.Was ever any man so loth to trustHis eyes as I ? or was there ever yetAny so like as this to Amoret ? For whose dear sake , I promise if there beA living soul within thee , thus to freeThy body from it. [ He hurts her again .
So , this work hath end : Farewel and live , be constant to thy friendThat loves thee next .
Satyr , Perigot runs off .
See the day begins to break , And the light shoots like a streakOf subtil fire , the wind blows cold , Whilst the morning doth unfold ; Now the Birds begin to rouse , And the Squirril from the boughsLeaps to get him Nuts and fruit ; The early Lark that erst was mute , Carrols to the rising dayMany a note and many a lay : Therefore here I end my watch , Lest the wandring swain should catchHarm , or lose himself .
Ah me !
Speak again what e 're thou be , I am ready , speak I say : By the dawning of the day , By the power of night and Pan , I inforce thee speak again .
O I am most unhappy .
Yet more blood ! Sure these wanton Swains are wode.Can there be a hand or heartDare commit so vile a partAs this Murther ? By the MoonThat hid her self when this was done , Never was a sweeter face : I will bear her to the placeWhere my Goddess keeps ; and craveHer to give her life , or grave. [ Exeunt .
Clorin .
Here whilst one patient takes his rest secureI steal abroad to doe another Cure.Pardon thou buryed body of my love , That from thy side I dare so soon remove , I will not prove unconstant , nor will leaveThee for an hour alone. When I deceiveMy first made vow , the wildest of the woodTear me , and o 're thy Grave let out my blood ; I goe by wit to cure a lovers painWhich no herb can ; being done , I'le come again. [ Exit .
Thenot .
Poor Shepherd in this shade for ever lye , And seeing thy fair Clorins Cabin , dye:0 hapless love , which [ being ] answer 'd , ends ; And as a little infant cryes and bendsHis tender Brows , when rowling of his eyeHe hath espy 'd some thing that glisters nighWhich he would have , yet give it him , awayHe throws it straight , and cryes afresh to playWith something else : such my affection , setOn that which I should loath , if I could get .
Clorin .
See where he lyes ; did ever man but heLove any woman for her ConstancieTo her dead lover , which she needs must endBefore she can allow him for her friend , And he himself must needs the cause destroy , For which he loves , before he can enjoy ? Poor Shepherd , Heaven grant I at once may freeThee from thy pain , and keep my loyaltie:
, look up .
Thy brightness doth amaze ! So Phoebus may at noon bid mortals gaze , Thy glorious constancie appears so bright , I dare not meet the Beams with my weak sight .
Why dost thou pine away thy self for me ?
Why dost thou keep such spotless constancie ?
Thou holy Shepherd , see what for thy sake
, thy Clorin , now dare under take. [ He starts up .
Stay there , thou constant Clorin , if there beYet any part of woman left in thee , To make thee light : think yet before thou speak .
See what a holy vow for thee I break.I that already have my fame far spreadFor being constant to my lover dead .
Think yet , dear Clorin , of your love , how true , If you had dyed , he would have been to you .
Yet all I'le lose for thee .
Think but how blestA constant woman is above the rest .
And offer up my self , here on this ground , To be dispos 'd by thee .
Why dost thou woundHis heart with malice , against woman more , That hated all the Sex , but thee before ? How much more pleasant had it been to meTo dye , than to behold this change in thee ? Yet , yet , return , let not the woman sway .
Insult not on her now , nor use delay , Who for thy sake hath ventur 'd all her fame .
Thou hast not ventur 'd , but bought certain shame , Your Sexes curse , foul falshood must and shall , I see , once in your lives , light on you all.I hate thee now : yet turn .
Be just to me : Shall I at once both lose my fame and thee ?
Thou hadst no fame , that which thou didst like good , Was but thy appetite that sway 'd thy bloodFor that time to the best : for as a blastThat through a house comes , usually doth castThings out of order , yet by chance may come , And blow some one thing to his proper room ; So did thy appetite , and not thy zeal , Sway thee [ by ] chance to doe some one thing well.Yet turn .
Thou dost but try me if I wouldForsake thy dear imbraces , for my oldLove 's , though he were alive : but do not fear .
I do contemn thee now , and dare come near , And gaze upon thee ; for me thinks that grace , Austeritie , which sate upon that faceIs gone , and thou like others : false maid see , This is the gain of foul inconstancie. [ Exit .
'T is done , great Pan I give thee thanks for it , What art could not have heal 'd , is cur 'd by wit .
Thenot , again .
Will ye be constant yet ? will ye removeInto the Cabin to your buried Love ?
No let me die , but by thy side remain .
There 's none shall know that thou didst ever stainThy worthy strictness , but shall honour 'd be , And I will lye again under this tree , And pine and dye for thee with more delight , Than I have sorrow now to know the light .
Let me have thee , and I'le be where thou wilt .
Thou art of womens race , and full of guilt.Farewel all hope of that Sex , whilst I thoughtThere was one good , I fear 'd to find one naught : But since their minds I all alike espie , Henceforth I'le choose as others , by mine eye .
Blest be ye powers that give such quick redress , And for my labours sent so good success.I rather choose , though I a woman be , He should speak ill of all , than die for me .
Priest , and old Shepherd .
Shepherds , rise and shake off sleep , See the blushing Morn doth peepThrough the window , whilst the SunTo the mountain tops is run , Gilding all the Vales belowWith his rising flames , which growGreater by his climbing still.Up ye lazie grooms , and fillBagg and Bottle for the field ; Clasp your cloaks fast , lest they yieldTo the bitter North-east wind.Call the Maidens up , and findWho lay longest , that she mayGoe without a friend all day ; Then reward your Dogs , and pray
to keep you from decay : So unfold and then away.What not a Shepherd stirring ? sure the groomsHave found their beds too easie , or the roomsFill 'd with such new delight , and heat , that theyHave both forgot their hungry sheep , and day ; Knock , that they may remember what a shameSloath and neglect layes on a Shepherds name .
It is to little purpose , not a swainThis night hath known his lodging here , or lainWithin these cotes : the woods , or some near town , That is a neighbour to the bordering Down , Hath drawn them thither , 'bout some lustie sport , Or spiced Wassel-Boul , to which resortAll the young men and maids of many a cote , Whilst the trim Minstrel strikes his merry note .
God pardon sin , show me the way that leadsTo any of their haunts .
This to the meads , And that down to the woods .
Then this for me ; Come Shepherd let me crave your companie. [ Exeunt .
Clorin , in her Cabin , Alexis , with her .
Now your thoughts are almost pure , And your wound begins to cure : Strive to banish all that 's vain , Lest it should break out again .
Eternal thanks to thee , thou holy maid : I find my former wandring thoughts well staidThrough thy wise precepts , and my outward painBy thy choice herbs is almost gone again : Thy sexes vice and vertue are reveal'dAt once , for what one hurt , another heal 'd .
May thy grief more appease , Relapses are the worst disease.Take heed how you in thought offend , So mind and body both will mend .
Satyr , with Amoret .
Beest thou the wildest creature of the wood , That bearst me thus away , drown 'd in my blood , And dying , know I can not injur 'd be , I am a maid , let that name fight for me .
Fairest Virgin do not fearMe , that do thy body bear , Not to hurt , but heal 'd to be ; Men are ruder far than we.See fair Goddess in the wood , They have let out yet more blood.Some savage man hath struck her breastSo soft and white , that no wild beastDurst ha ' toucht asleep , or wake : So sweet , that Adder , Newte , or Snake , Would have lain from arm to arm , On her bosom to be warmAll a night , and being hot , Gone away and stung her not.Quickly clap herbs to her breast ; A man sure is a kind of beast .
With spotless hand , on spotless brestI put these herbs to give thee rest : Which till it heal thee , will abide , If both be pure , if not , off slide.See it falls off from the wound , Shepherdess thou art not sound , Full of lust .
, Who would have thought it , So fair a face ?
Why that hath brought it .
For ought I know or think , these words , my last : Yet Pan so help me as my thoughts are chast .
And so may Pan bless this my cure , As all my thoughts are just and pure ; Some uncleanness nigh doth lurk , That will not let my Medicines work .
search if thou canst find it .
Here away methinks I wind it , Stronger yet : Oh here they be , Here , here , in a hollow tree , Two fond mortals have I found .
Bring them out , they are unsound .
Cloe , and Daphnis .
By the fingers thus I wring ye , To my Goddess thus I bring ye ; Strife is vain , come gently in , I scented them , they 're full of sin .
Hold Satyr , take this Glass , Sprinkle over all the place , Purge the Air from lustfull breath , To save this Shepherdess from death , And stand you still whilst I do dressHer wound for fear the pain encrease .
From this glass I throw a dropOf Crystal water on the topOf every grass , on flowers a pair : Send a fume and keep the airPure and wholsom , sweet and blest , Till this Virgins wound be drest .
, help to bring her in .
By Pan , I think she hath no sin , She is so light : lye on these leaves.Sleep that mortal sense deceives , Crown thine Eyes , and ease thy pain , Maist thou soon be well again .
, bring the Shepherd near , Try him if his mind be clear .
Shepherd come .
My thoughts are pure .
The better trial to endure .
In this flame his finger thrust , Which will burn him if he lust ; But if not , away will turn , As loth unspotted flesh to burn : See , it gives back , let him go , Farewel mortal , keep thee so .
Stay fair Nymph , flye not so fast , We must try if you be chaste : Here 's a hand that quakes for fear , Sure she will not prove so clear .
Hold her finger to the flame , That will yield her praise or shame .
To her doom she dares not stand , But plucks away her tender hand , And the Taper darting sendsHis hot beams at her fingers ends : O thou art foul within , and hastA mind , if nothing else , unchaste .
Is not that Cloe ? 't is my Love , 't is she !
, fair Cloe .
My Alexis .
He .
Let me embrace thee .
Take her hence , Lest her sight disturb his sence .
Take not her , take my life first .
See , his wound again is burst : Keep her near , here in the Wood , Till I ha ' stopt these Streams of Blood.Soon again he ease shall find , If I can but still his mind : This Curtain thus I do display , To keep the piercing air away .
old Shepherd , and Priest .
Sure they are lost for ever ; 't is in vainTo find 'em out with trouble and much pain , That have a ripe desire , and forward willTo flye the Company of all but ill , What shall be counsel 'd now ? shall we retire ? Or constant follow still that first desireWe had to find them ?
Stay a little while ; For if the Morning mist do not beguileMy sight with shadows , sure I see a Swain ; One of this jolly Troop 's come back again .
Thenot .
Dost thou not blush young Shepherd to be known , Thus without care , leaving thy flocks alone , And following what desire and present bloodShapes out before thy burning sense , for good , Having forgot what tongue hereafter mayTell to the World thy falling off , and sayThou art regardless both of good and shame , Spurning at Vertue , and a vertuous Name , And like a glorious , desperate man that buysA poyson of much price , by which he dies , Dost thou lay out for Lust , whose only gainIs foul disease , with present age and pain , And then a Grave ? These be the fruits that growIn such hot Veins that only beat to knowWhere they may take most ease , and grow ambitiousThrough their own wanton fire , and pride delicious .
Right holy Sir , I have not known this night , What the smooth face of Mirth was , or the sightOf any looseness ; musick , joy , and ease , Have been to me as bitter drugs to pleaseA Stomach lost with weakness , not a gameThat I am skill 'd at throughly ; nor a Dame , Went her tongue smoother than the feet of Time , Her beauty ever living like the RimeOur blessed Tityrus did sing of yore , No , were she more enticing than the storeOf fruitful Summer , when the loaden TreeBids the faint Traveller be bold and free , 'Twere but to me like thunder 'gainst the bay , Whose lightning may enclose but never stayUpon his charmed branches ; such am IAgainst the catching flames of Womans eye .
Then wherefore hast thou wandred ?
'T was a VowThat drew me out last night , which I have nowStrictly perform 'd , and homewards go to giveFresh pasture to my Sheep , that they may live .
'T is good to hear ye , Shepherd , if the heartIn this well sounding Musick bear his part.Where have you left the rest ?
I have not seen , Since yesternight we met upon this greenTo fold our Flocks up , any of that train ; Yet have I walkt these Woods round , and have lainAll this same night under an aged Tree , Yet neither wandring Shepherd did I see , Or Shepherdess , or drew into mine earThe sound of living thing , unless it wereThe Nightingale among the thick leav 'd springThat sits alone in sorrow , and doth singWhole nights away in mourning , or the Owl , Or our great enemy that still doth howlAgainst the Moons cold beams .
Go and bewareOf after falling .
Father 't is my care. [ Exit Thenot .
Daphnis .
Here comes another Stragler , sure I seeA Shame in this young Shepherd. Daphnis !
He .
Where hast thou left the rest , that should have beenLong before this , grazing upon the greenTheir yet imprison 'd flocks ?
Thou holy man , Give me a little breathing till I canBe able to unfold what I have seen ; Such horrour that the like hath never beenKnown to the ear of Shepherd : Oh my heartLabours a double motion to impartSo heavy tidings ! You all know the BowerWhere the chast Clorin lives , by whose great powerSick men and Cattel have been often cur 'd , There lovely Amoret that was assur'dTo lusty Perigot , bleeds out her life , Forc 'd by some Iron hand and fatal knife ; And by her young Alexis .
Amaryllis running from her Sullen Shepherd .
If there beEver a Neighbour Brook , or hollow tree , Receive my Body , close me up from lustThat follows at my heels ; be ever just , Thou god of Shepherds , Pan , for her dear sakeThat loves the Rivers brinks , and still doth shakeIn cold remembrance of thy quick pursuit : Let me be made a reed , and ever mute , Nod to the waters fall , whilst every blastSings through my slender leaves that I was chast .
This is a night of wonder , AmaryllBe comforted , the holy gods are stillRevengers of these wrongs .
Thou blessed man , Honour 'd upon these plains , and lov 'd of Pan , Hear me , and save from endless infamieMy yet unblasted Flower , Virginitie : By all the Garlands that have crown 'd that head , By the chaste office , and the Marriage bedThat still is blest by thee , by all the rightsDue to our gods ; and by those Virgin lightsThat burn before his Altar , let me notFall from my former state to gain the blotThat never shall be purg 'd : I am not nowThat wanton Amaryllis : here I vowTo Heaven , and thee grave Father , if I may'Scape this unhappy Night , to know the Day , To live a Virgin , never to endureThe tongues , or Company of men impure.I hear him come , save me .
Retire a whileBehind this Bush , till we have known that vileAbuser of young Maidens .
Sullen .
Stay thy pace , Most loved Amaryllis , let the ChaseGrow calm and milder , flye me not so fast , I fear the pointed Brambles have unlac'dThy golden Buskins ; turn again and seeThy Shepherd follow , that is strong and free , Able to give thee all content and ease.I am not bashful , Virgin , I can pleaseAt first encounter , hug thee in mine arm , And give thee many Kisses , soft and warmAs those the Sun prints on the smiling CheekOf Plums , or mellow Peaches ; I am sleekAnd smooth as Neptune , when stern EolusLocks up his surly Winds , and nimbly thusCan shew my active Youth ; why dost thou flye ? Remember Amaryllis , it was IThat kill 'd Alexis for thy sake , and setAn everlasting hate 'twixt AmoretAnd her beloved Perigot : 't was IThat drown 'd her in the Well , where she must lyeTill Time shall leave to be ; then turn again , Turn with thy open arms , and clip the SwainThat hath perform 'd all this , turn , turn I say : I must not be deluded .
Monster stay , Thou that art like a Canker to the StateThou liv'st and breath'st in , eating with debateThrough every honest bosome , forcing stillThe Veins of any that may serve thy Will , Thou that hast offer 'd with a sinful handTo seize upon this Virgin that doth standYet trembling here .
Good holiness declare , What had the danger been , if being bareI had embrac 'd her , tell me by your Art , What coming wonders would that sight impart ?
Lust , and a branded Soul .
Yet tell me more , Hath not our Mother Nature for her storeAnd great encrease , said it is good and just , And wills that every living Creature mustBeget his like ?
Ye are better read than I , I must confess , in blood and Lechery.Now to the Bower , and bring this Beast along , Where he may suffer Penance for his wrong. [ Exeunt .
Perigot with his hands bloody .
, Clorin appears sitting in the Cabin , Amoret
, Alexis and Cloe on the other , theSatyr standing by .
Shepherd , once more your blood is staid , Take example by this Maid , Who is heal 'd ere you be pure , So hard it is lewd lust to cure.Take heed then how you turn your eyeOn each other lustfully : And Shepherdess take heed lest youMove his willing eye thereto ; Let no wring , nor pinch , nor smileOf yours his weaker sense beguile.Is your Love yet true and chaste , And for ever so to last ?
I have forgot all vain desires , All looser thoughts , ill tempred fires , True Love I find a pleasant fume , Whose moderate heat can ne'r consume .
And I a new fire feel in me , Whose chaste flame is not quencht to be .
Join your hands with modest touch , And for ever keep you such .
Perigot .
Yon is her Cabin , thus far off I 'll stand , And call her forth ; for my unhallowed handI dare not bring so near yon sacred place .
come forth , and do a timely graceTo a poor Swain .
What art thou that dost call ?
is ready to do good to all : Come near .
I dare not .
, seeWho it is that calls on me .
There at hand , some Swain doth stand , Stretching out a bloudy hand .
Come Clorin , bring thy holy waters clear , To wash my hand .
What wonders have been hereTo night ? stretch forth thy hand young Swain , Wash and rub it whilest I rainHoly water .
Still you pour , But my hand will never scower .
, bring him to the Bower , We will try the Soveraign powerOf other waters .
Mortal , sure'Tis the Blood of Maiden pureThat stains thee so. [ The Satyr leadeth him to the Bower , where he spieth Amoret , andkneeling down , she knoweth him .
What e 're thou be , Be'st thou her spright , or some divinitie , That in her shape thinks good to walk this grove , Pardon poor Perigot .
I am thy love , Thy Amoret , for evermore thy love : Strike once more on my naked breast , I'le proveAs constant still. O couldst thou love me yet ; How soon should I my former griefs forget !
So over-great with joy , that you live , nowI am , that no desire of knowing howDoth seize me ; hast thou still power to forgive ?
Whilest thou hast power to love , or I to live ; More welcome now than hadst thou never goneAstray from me .
And when thou lov'st aloneAnd not I , death , or some lingring painThat 's worse , light on me .
Now your stainThis perhaps will cleanse again ; See the blood that erst did stay , With the water drops away.All the powers again are pleas 'd , And with this new knot appeas'd.Joyn your hands , and rise together,
be blest that brought you hither .
Priest , and Old Shephe [ rd ] .
Go back again what ere thou art , unlessSmooth Maiden thoughts possess thee , do not pressThis hallowed ground. Go Satyr , take his hand , And give him present trial .
Mortal stand , Till by fire I have made knownWhether thou be such a one , That mayst freely tread this place.Hold thy hand up ; never wasMore untainted flesh than this.Fairest , he is full of bliss .
Then boldly speak , why dost thou seek this place ?
First , honour 'd Virgin , to behold thy faceWhere all good dwells that is : Next for to tryThe truth of late report was given to me : Those Shepherds that have met with foul mischance , Through much neglect , and more ill governance , Whether the wounds they have may yet endureThe open Air , or stay a longer cure.And lastly , what the doom may be shall lightUpon those guilty wretches , through whose spightAll this confusion fell : For to this place , Thou holy Maiden , have I brought the raceOf these offenders , who have freely told , Both why , and by what means they gave this boldAttempt upon their lives .
Fume all the ground , And sprinkle holy water , for unsoundAnd foul infection 'gins to fill the Air : It gathers yet more strongly ; take a pairOf Censors fill 'd with Frankincense and Mirrh , Together with cold Camphyre : quickly stirThee , gentle Satyr , for the place beginsTo sweat and labour with the abhorred sinsOf those offenders ; let them not come nigh , For full of itching flame and leprosieTheir very souls are , that the ground goes back , And shrinks to feel the sullen weight of blackAnd so unheard of venome ; hie thee fastThou holy man , and banish from the chastThese manlike monsters , let them never moreBe known upon these downs , but long beforeThe next Suns rising , put them from the sightAnd memory of every honest wight.Be quick in expedition , lest the soresOf these weak Patients break into new gores. [ Ex. Priest .
My dear , dear Amoret , how happy areThose blessed pairs , in whom a little jarHath bred an everlasting love , too strongFor time , or steel , or envy to do wrong ? How do you feel your hurts ? Alas poor heart , How much I was abus 'd ; give me the smartFor it is justly mine .
I do believe.It is enough dear friend , leave off to grieve , And let us once more in despight of illGive hands and hearts again .
With better willThan e 're I went to find in hottest dayCool Crystal of the Fountain , to allayMy eager thirst : may this band never break.Hear us O Heaven .
Be constant .
Else Pan wreak , With [ d ] ouble vengeance , my disloyalty ; Let me not dare to know the companyOf men , or any more behold those eyes .
Thus Shepherd with a kiss all envy dyes .
Priest .
Bright Maid , I have perform 'd your will , the SwainIn whom such heat and black rebellions raignHath undergone your sentence , and disgrace : Only the Maid I have reserv 'd , whose faceShews much amendment , many a tear doth fallIn sorrow of her fault , great fair recalYour heavy doom , in hope of better daies , Which I dare promise ; once again upraiseHer heavy Spirit that near drowned lyesIn self consuming care that never dyes .
I am content to pardon , call her in ; The Air grows cool again , and doth beginTo purge it self , how bright the day doth showAfter this stormy Cloud ! go Satyr , go , And with this Taper boldly try her hand , If she be pure and good , and firmly standTo be so still , we have perform 'd a workWorthy the Gods themselves. [ Satyr brings Amaryllis in .
Come forward Maiden , do not lurkNor hide your face with grief and shame , Now or never get a nameThat may raise thee , and recureAll thy life that was impure : Hold your hand unto the flame , If thou beest a perfect dame , Or hast truely vow 'd to mend , This pale fire will be thy friend.See the Taper hurts her not.Go thy wayes , let never spotHenceforth seize upon thy blood.Thank the Gods and still be good .
And all those blessings Heaven did ever give , We pray upon this Bower may ever live .
No other service , Satyr , but thy watchAbout these thickets , lest harmless people catchMischief or sad mischance .
Holy Virgin , I will danceRound about these woods as quickAs the breaking light , and prickDown the Lawns , and down the vailsFaster than the Wind-mill sails.So I take my leave , and prayAll the comforts of the day , Such as Phoebus heat doth sendOn the earth , may still befriendThee , and this arbour .
And to thee , All thy Masters love be free. [ Exeunt .

John Fletcher : These lines are in A and B.To the Reader.If you be not reasonably assurde of your knowledge in this kinde of Poeme , lay downe the booke or read this , which I would wish had bene theprologue. It is a pastorall Tragic-comedie , which the people seeing whenit was plaid , having ever had a singuler guift in defining , concluded tobe a play of contry hired Shepheards , in gray cloakes , with curtaild dogsin strings , sometimes laughing together , and sometimes killing one
to be angry. In their error I would not have you fall , least you incurretheir censure. Understand therefore a pastorall to be a representation ofshepheards and shephearddesses , with their actions and passions , whichmust be such as may agree with their natures at least not exceeding formerfictions , & vulgar traditions : they are not to be adorn 'd with any art , but such improper ones as nature is said to bestow , as singing and Poetry , or such as experience may teach them , as the vertues of hearbs , &
such like. But you are ever to remember Shepherds to be such , as all theancient Poets and moderne of understanding have receaved them : that is , the owners of flockes and not hyerlings. A tragie-comedie is not so calledin respect of mirth and killing , but in respect it wants deaths , which isinough to make it no tragedie , yet brings some neere it , which is inoughto make it no comedie : which must be a representation of familiar people , with such kinde of trouble as no life be questiond , so that a God is aslawfull in this as in a tragedie , and meane people as in a comedie. Thismuch I hope will serve to justifie my Poeme , and make you understand it , to teach you more for nothing , I do not know that I am in consciencebound .

Mardonius and Bessus , Two Captains .
, the King has made a fair hand o n't , he has ended theWars at a blow , would my sword had a close basket hilt to holdWine , and the blade would make knives , for we shall have nothingbut eating and drinking .
We that are Commanders shall do well enough .
Faith Bessus , such Commanders as thou may ; I had as lieve setthee Perdue for a pudding i'th ' dark , as Alexander the Great .
I love these jests exceedingly .
I think thou lov'st 'em better than quarrelling Bessus , I'lesay so much i'thy behalf , and yet thou 'rt valiant enough upon aretreat , I think thou wouldst kill any man that stopt thee ifthou couldst .
But was not this a brave Combate Mardonius ?
Why , didst thou see't ?
You stood wi'me .
I did so , but me thought thou wink'dst every blow they strook .
Well , I believe there are better souldiers than I , that never sawtwo Princes fight in lists .
By my troth I think so too Bessus , many a thousand , butcertainly all that are worse than thou have seen as much .
'T was bravely done of our King .
Yes , if he had not ended the wars : I'me glad thou dar'st talk ofsuch dangerous businesses .
To take a Prince prisoner in the heart of 's own Country in singlecombat .
See how thy blood curdles at this , I think thou couldst becontented to be beaten i'this passion .
Shall I tell you truly ?
I .
I could willingly venture for't .
Um , no venture neither Bessus .
Let me not live , if I do not think 't is a braver piece of servicethan that I'me so fam 'd for .
Why , art thou fam 'd for any valour ?
Fam 'd ! I , I warrant you .
I'me e'en heartily glad o n't , I have been with thee e 're sincethou cam'st to th'wars , and this is the first word that ever Iheard o n't , prethee who fames thee .
The Christian world .
'T is heathenishly done of'em in my conscience , thou deserv'st itnot .
Yes , I ha ' don good service .
I do not know how thou mayst wait of a man in 's Chamber , or thyagility of shifting of a Trencher , but otherwise no service good
You saw me do the service your self .
Not so hasty sweet Bessus , where was it , is the placevanish 'd ?
At Bessus desp'rate redemption .
At Bessus desp'rate redemption , where 's that ?
There where I redeem 'd the day , the place bears my name .
Pray thee , who Christened it ?
The Souldiers .
If I were not a very merrily dispos 'd man , what would become ofthee ? one that had but a grain of choler in the whole compositionof his body , would send thee of an errand to the worms forputting thy name upon that field : did not I beat thee there i'th'head o'th ' Troops with a Trunchion , because thou wouldst needsrun away with thy company , when we should charge the enemy ?
True , but I did not run .
Right Bessus , I beat thee out o n't .
But came I not up when the day was gone , and redeem'dall ?
Thou knowest , and so do I , thou meanedst to flie , and thy fearmaking thee mistake , thou ranst upon the enemy , and a hot chargethou gav'st , as I'le do thee right , thou art furious in runningaway , and I think , we owe thy fear for our victory ; If I were theKing , and were sure thou wouldst mistake alwaies and run awayupon th ' enemy , thou shouldst be General by this light .
You'l never leave this till I fall foul .
No more such words dear Bessus , for though I have ever knownthee a coward , and therefore durst never strike thee , yet if thouproceedest , I will allow thee valiant , and beat thee .
Come , our King 's a brave fellow .
He is so Bessus , I wonder how thou cam'st to know it. But ifthou wer't a man of understanding , I would tell thee , he isvain-glorious , and humble , and angry , and patient , and merry anddull , and joyful and sorrowful in extremity in an hour : Do notthink me thy friend for this , for if I ear 'd who knew it , thoushouldst not hear it Bessus. Here he is with his prey in hisfoot .
Arbaces and Tigranes , Two Kings and two Gentlemen .
Thy sadness brave Tigranes takes awayFrom my full victory , am I becomeOf so small fame , that any man should grieveWhen I o'recome him ? They that plac 'd me here , Intended it an honour large enough , ( though heFor the most valiant living , but to dare oppose me single , Lost the day. What should afflict you , you are as free as I , To be my prisoner , is to be more freeThan you were formerly , and never thinkThe man I held worthy to combate meShall be us 'd servilely : Thy ransom isTo take my only Sister to thy Wife.A heavy one Tigranes , for she isA Lady , that the neighbour Princes sendBlanks to fetch home. I have been too unkindTo her Tigranes , she but nine years oldI left her , and ne 're saw her since , your warsHave held me long and taught me though a youth , The way to victory , she was a pretty child , Then I was little better , but now fameCries loudly on her , and my messengersMake me believe she is a miracle ; She'l make you shrink , as I did , with a stroakBut of her eye Tigranes .
Is't the course of Iberia to use their prisoners thus ? Had fortune thrown my name above Arbace , I should not thus have talk 'd Sir , in ArmeniaWe hold it base , you should have kept your temperTill you saw home again , where 't is the fashionPerhaps to brag .
Be you my witness earth , need I to brag , Doth not this captive Prince speakMe sufficiently , and all the actsThat I have wrought upon his suffering Land ; Should I then boast ! where lies that foot of groundWithin his whole Realm , that I have not past , Fighting and conquering ; Far then from meBe ostentation. I could tell the worldHow I have laid his Kingdom desolateBy this sole Arm prop't by divinity , Stript him out of his glories , and have sentThe pride of all his youth to people graves , And made his Virgins languish for their Loves , If I would brag , should I that have the powerTo teach the Neighbour world humility , Mix with vain-glory ?
Indeed this is none .
, Nay did I but take delightTo stretch my deeds as others do , on words , I could amaze my hearers .
So you do .
But he shall wrong his and my modesty , That thinks me apt to boast after any actFit for a good man to do upon his foe.A little glory in a souldiers mouthIs well-becoming , be it far from vain .
'T is pity that valour should be thus drunk .
I offer you my Sister , and you answerI do insult , a Lady that no suiteNor treasure , nor thy Crown could purchase thee , But that thou fought'st with me .
Though this be worseThan that you spake before , it strikes me not ; But that you think to overgrace me withThe marriage of your Sister , troubles me.I would give worlds for ransoms were they mine , Rather than have her .
See if I insultThat am the Conquerour , and for a ransomOffer rich treasure to the Conquered , Which he refuses , and I bear his scorn : It can not be self-flattery to say , The Daughters of your Country set by her , Would see their shame , run home and blush to death , At their own foulness ; yet she is not fair , Nor beautiful , those words express her not , They say her looks have something excellent , That wants a name : yet were she odious , Her birth deserves the Empire of the world , Sister to such a brother , that hath ta'neVictory prisoner , and throughout the earth , Carries her bound , and should he let her loose , She durst not leave him ; Nature did her wrong , To Print continual conquest on her cheeks , And make no man worthy for her to tasteBut me that am too near her , and as strangelyShe did for me , but you will think I brag .
I do I'le be sworn. Thy valour and thy passions sever 'd , wouldhave made two excellent fellows in their kinds : I know notwhether I should be sorry thou art so valiant , or so passionate , wou 'd one of 'em were away .
Do I refuse her that I doubt her worth ? Were she as vertuous as she would be thought , So perfect that no one of her own sexCould find a want , had she so tempting fair , That she could wish it off for damning souls , I would pay any ransom , twenty livesRather than meet her married in my bed.Perhaps I have a love , where I have fixtMine eyes not to be mov 'd , and she on me , I am not fickle .
Is that all the cause ? Think you , you can so knit your self in loveTo any other , that her searching sightCannot dissolve it ? So before you tri 'd , You thought your self a match for me in [ f ] ight , Trust me Tigranes , she can do as muchIn peace , as I in war , she'l conquer too , You shall see if you have the power to standThe force of her swift looks , if you dislike , I'le send you home with love , and name your ransomSome other way , but if she be your choice , She frees you : To Iberia you must .
Sir , I have learn 'd a prisoners sufferance , And will obey , but give me leave to talkIn private with some friends before I go .
Some to await him forth , and see him safe , But let him freely send for whom he please , And none dare to disturb his conference , I will not have him know what bondage is , [ Exit Tigranes.Till he be free from me. This Prince , Mardonius , Is full of wisdom , valour , all the gracesMan can receive .
And yet you conquer 'd him .
And yet I conquer 'd him , and could have don'tHadst thou joyn 'd with him , though thy name in ArmsBe great ; must all men that are vertuousThink suddenly to match themselves with me ? I conquered him and bravely , did I not ?
And please your Majesty , I was afraid at first .
When wert thou other ?
Of what ?
That you would not have spy 'd your best advantages , for yourMajesty in my opinion lay too high , methinks , under favour , youshould have lain thus .
Like a Taylor at a wake .
And then , if please your Majesty to remember , at one time , by mytroth I wisht my self wi'you .
By my troth thou wouldst ha ' stunk 'em both out o'th ' Lists .
What to do ?
To put your Majesty in mind of an occasion ; you lay thus , and
falsified a blow at your Leg , which you by doing thusavoided ; but if you had whip 'd up your Leg thus , and reach 'd himon the ear , you had made the Blood-Royal run down his head .
What Country Fence-school learn'st thou at ?
Pish , did not I take him nobly ?
Why you did , and you have talked enough o n't .
Talkt enough ? Will you confine my word ? by heaven and earth , I were much better be a King of beastsThan such a people : if I had not patienceAbove a God , I should be call 'd a TyrantThroughout the world. They will offend to deathEach minute : Let me hear thee speak again , And thou art earth again : why this is like
speech that needs would say I brag 'd .
, he said I brag 'd .
Ha , ha , ha .
Why dost thou laugh ? By all the world , I 'm grown ridiculousTo my own Subjects : Tie me in a ChairAnd jest at me , but I shall make a start , And punish some that others may take heedHow they are haughty ; who will answer me ? He said I boasted , speak Mardonius , Did I ? He will not answer , O my temper ! I give you thanks above , that taught my heartPatience , I can endure his silence ; what will noneVouchsafe to give me answer ? am I grownTo such a poor respect , or do you meanTo break my wind ? Speak , speak , some one of you , Or else by heaven .
So please your .
Monstrous , I can not be heard out , they cut me off , As if I were too saucy , I will liveIn woods , and talk to trees , they will allow meTo end what I begin. The meanest SubjectCan find a freedom to discharge his soulAnd not I , now it is a time to speak , I hearken .
May it please .
I mean not you , Did not I stop you once ? but I am grownTo balk , but I defie , let another speak .
I hope your Majesty .
Thou drawest thy words , That I must wait an hour , where other menCan hear in instants ; throw your words away , Quick , and to purpose , I have told you this .
And please your Majesty .
Wilt thou devour me ? this is such a rudenessAs you never shew 'd me , and I wantPower to command too , else MardoniusWould speak at my request ; were you my King , I would have answered at your word Mardonius , I pray you speak , and truely , did I boast ?
Truth will offend you .
You take all great care what will offend me , When you dare to utter such things as these .
You told Tigranes , you had won his Land , With that sole arm propt by Divinity : Was not that bragging , and a wrong to us , That daily ventured lives ?
O that thy nameWere as great , as mine , would I had paid my wealth , It were as great , as I might combate thee , I would through all the Regions habitableSearch thee , and having found thee , wi'my SwordDrive thee about the world , till I had metSome place that yet mans curiosityHath mist of ; there , there would I strike thee dead : Forgotten of mankind , such Funeral ritesAs beasts would give thee , thou shouldst have .
The King rages extreamly , shall we slink away ? He'l strike us .
Content .
There I would make you know 't was this sole arm.I grant you were my instruments , and didAs I commanded you , but 't was this armMov 'd you like wheels , it mov 'd you as it pleas'd.Whither slip you now ? what are you too goodTo wait on me ( puffe , ) I had need have temperThat rule such people ; I have nothing leftAt my own choice , I would I might be private : Mean men enjoy themselves , but 't is our curse , To have a tumult that out of their lovesWill wait on us , whether we will or no ; Go get you gone : Why here they stand like death , My words move nothing .
Must we go ?
I know not .
I pray you leave me Sirs , I'me proud of this , That you will be intreated from my sight : Why now the [ y ] leave me all : Mardonius. [ Exeunt all but Arb. and Mar .
Sir .
Will you leave me quite alone ? me thinksCivility should teach you more than this , If I were but your friend : Stay here and wait .
Sir shall I speak ?
Why , you would now think muchTo be denied , but I can scar [ c ] e intreatWhat I would have : do , speak .
But will you hear me out ?
With me you Article to talk thus : well , I will hear you out .
Sir , that I have ever lov 'd you , my sword hath spoken for me ; that I do , if it be doubted , I dare call an oath , a great one tomy witness ; and were you not my King , from amongst men , I shouldhave chose you out to love above the rest : nor can this challengethanks , for my own sake I should have done it , because I wouldhave lov 'd the most deserving man , for so you are .
Alas Mardonius , rise you shall not kneel , We all are souldiers , and all venture lives : And where there is no difference in mens worths , Titles are jests , who can outvalue thee ?
thou hast lov 'd me , and hast wrong , Thy love is not rewarded , but believeIt shall be better , more than friend in arms , My Father , and my Tutor , good Mardonius .
Sir , you did promise you would hear me out .
And so I will ; speak freely , for from theeNothing can come but worthy things and true .
Though you have all this worth , you hold some qualities that doEclipse your vertues .
Eclipse my vertues ?
Yes , your passions , which are so manifold , that they appear evenin this : when I commend you , you hug me for that truth : but whenI speak your faults , you make a start , and flie the hearing but .
When you commend me ? O that I should liveTo need such commendations : If my deedsBlew not my praise themselves about the earth , I were most wretched : spare your idle praise : If thou didst mean to flatter , and shouldst utterWords in my praise , that thou thoughtst impudence , My deeds should make 'em modest : when you praise I hugyou ? 't is so [ false ] , that wert thou worthy thou shouldst receivea death , a glorious death from me : but thou shalt understandthy lies , for shouldst thou praise me into Heaven , and thereleave me inthron 'd , I would despise thee though as much asnow , which is as much as dust because I see thy envie .
However you will use me after , yet for your own promise sake , hear me the rest .
I will , and after call unto the winds , for they shall lend aslarge an ear as I to what you utter : speak .
Would you but leave these hasty tempers , whichI do not say take from you all your worth , but darken 'em , then you will shine indeed .
Well .
Yet I would have you keep some passions , lest men should take youfor a God , your vertues are such .
Why now you flatter .
I never understood the word , were you no King , and free fromthese moods , should I choose a companion for wit and pleasure , itshould be you ; or for honesty to enterchange my bosom with , itshould be you ; or wisdom to give me counsel , I would pick outyou ; or valour to defend my reputation , still I should find youout ; for you are fit to fight for all the world , if it could comein question : Now I have spoke , consider to your self , find out ause ; if so , then what shall fall to me is not material .
Is not material ? more than ten such lives , as mine , Mardonius : it was nobly said , thou hast spoke truth , and boldly such a truthas might offend another. I have been too passionate and idle , thou shalt see a swift amendment , but I want those parts youpraise me for : I fight for all the world ? Give me a sword , andthou wilt go as far beyond me , as thou art beyond in years , Iknow thou dar'st and wilt ; it troubles me that I should use sorough a phrase to thee , impute it to my folly , what thou wilt , sothou wilt par [ d ] on me : that thou and I should differ thus !
Why 't is no matter Sir .
Faith but it is , but thou dost ever take all things I do , thuspatiently , for which I never can requite thee , but with love , andthat thou shalt be sure of. Thou and I have not been merry
thine ear ?
Why at the taking of a Town .
A wench upon my life , a wench Mardonius gave thee that jewel .
Wench ! they respect not me , I 'm old and rough , and every limbabout me , but that which should , grows stiffer , I'thosebusinesses I may swear I am truly honest : for I pay justly forwhat I take , and would be glad to be at a certainty .
Why , do the wenches encroach upon thee ?
I by this light do they .
Didst thou sit at an old rent with 'em ?
Yes faith .
And do they improve themselves ?
I ten shillings to me , every new young fellow they comeacquainted with .
How canst live o n't ?
Why I think I must petition to you .
Thou shalt take them up at my price .
Bessus .
Your price ?
I at the Kings price .
That may be more than I'me worth .
Is he not merry now ?
I think not .
He is , he is : we'l shew our selves .
Bessus , I thought you had been in Iberia by this , I bad youhast ; Gobrias will want entertainment for me .
And please your Majesty I have a sute .
Is't not lousie Bessus , what is't ?
I am to carry a Lady with me .
Then thou hast two sutes .
And if I can prefer her to the Lady Pentha your MajestiesSister , to learn fashions , as her friends term it , it will beworth something to me .
So many nights lodgings as 't is thither , wilt not ?
I know not that Sir , but gold I shall be sure of .
Why thou shalt bid her entertain her from me , so thou wiltresolve me one thing .
If I can .
Faith 't is a very disputable question , and yet I think thou canstdecide it .
Your Majesty has a good opinion of my understanding .
I have so good an opinion of it : 't is whether thou be valiant .
Some body has traduced me to you : do you see this sword Sir ?
Yes .
If I do not make my back-biters eat it to a knife within thisweek , say I am not valiant .
Health to your Majesty .
From Gobrias ?
Yes Sir .
How does he , is he well ?
In perfect health .
Take that for thy good news. A trustier servant to his Princethere lives not , than is good Gobrias .
The King starts back .
His blood goes back as fast .
And now it comes again .
He alters strangely .
The hand of Heaven is on me , be it far from me to struggle , if mysecret sins have pull 'd this curse upon me , lend me tears now towash me white , that I may feel a child-like innocence within mybreast ; which once perform 'd , O give me leave to stand as fix'das constancy her self , my eyes set here unmov 'd , regardless ofthe world though thousand miseries incompass me .
This is strange , Sir , how do you ?
Mardonius , my mother .
Is she dead ?
Alas she 's not so happy , thou dost know how she hath labouredsince my Father died to take by treason hence this loathed life , that would but be to serve her , I have pardoned , and pardoned , and by that have made her fit to practise new sins , not repentthe old : she now had stirr 'd a slave to come from thence , andstrike me here , whom Gobrias sifting out , took and condemn 'd andexecuted there , the carefulst servant : Heaven let me but live topay that man ; Nature is poor to me , that will not let me have asmany deaths as are the times that he hath say 'd my life , that Imight dye 'em over all for him .
Sir let her bear her sins on her own head , Vex not your self .
What will the worldConceive of me ? with what unnatural sinsWill they suppose me loaden , when my lifeIs sought by her that gave it to the world ? But yet he writes me comfort here , my Sister , He saies , is grown in beauty and in grace.In all the innocent vertues that becomeA tender spotless maid : she stains her cheeksWith morning tears to purge her mothers ill , And 'mongst that sacred dew she mingles PrayersHer pure Oblations for my safe return : If I have lost the duty of a Son , If any pomp or vanity of stateMade me forget my natural offices , Nay farther , if I have not every nightExpostulated with my wandring thoughts , If ought unto my parent they have err 'd , And call 'd 'em back : do you direct her armUnto this foul dissembling heart of mine : But if I have been just to her , send outYour power to compass me , and hold me safeFrom searching treason ; I will use no meansBut prayer : for rather suffer me to seeFrom mine own veins issue a deadly flood , Than wash my danger off with mothers blood .
I n'ere saw such suddain extremities. [ Exeunt .
Tigranes and Spaconia .
Why ? wilt thou have me die Spaconia.What should I do ?
Nay let me stay alone , And when you see Armenia again , You shall behold a Tomb more worth than I ; Some friend that ever lov 'd me or my cause , Will build me something to distinguish meFrom other women , many a weeping verseHe will lay on , and much lament those maids , That plac 'd their loves unfortunately high , As I have done , where they can never reach ; But why should you go to Iberia ?
Alas , that thou wilt ask me , ask the manThat rages in a Fever why he liesDistempered there , when all the other youthsAre coursing o 're the Meadows with their Loves ? Can I resist it ? am I not a slaveTo him that conquer 'd me ?
That conquer 'd thee Tigranes ! he has wonBut half of thee , thy body , but thy mindMay be as free as his , his will did neverCombate thine , and take it prisoner .
But if he by force convey my body hence , What helps it me or thee to be unwilling ?
O Tigranes , I know you are to see a Lady there , To see , and like I fear : perhaps the hopeOf her make [ s ] you forget me , ere we part , Be happier than you know to wish ; farewel .
, stay and hear me what I say : In short , destruction meet me that I maySee it , and not avoid it , when I leaveTo be thy faithful lover : part with meThou shalt not , there are none that know our love , And I have given gold unto a CaptainThat goes unto Iberia from the King , That he will place a Lady of our LandWith the Kings Sister that is offered me ; Thither shall you , and being once got inPerswade her by what subtil means you canTo be as backward in her love as I .
Can you imagine that a longing maidWhen she beholds you , can be pull 'd awayWith words from loving you ?
Dispraise my health , my honesty , and tell her I am jealous .
Why , I had rather lose you : can my heartConsent to let my tongue throw out such words , And I that ever yet spoke what I thought , Shall find it such a thing at first to lie ?
Yet do thy best .
Bessus .
What , is your Majesty ready ?
There is the Lady , Captain .
Sweet Lady , by your leave , I co [ u ] ld wish my self more full ofCourtship for your fair sake .
Sir I shall feel no want of that .
Lady , you must hast , I have received new letters from the Kingthat require more hast than I expected , he will follow mesuddenly himself , and begins to call for your Majesty already .
He shall not do so long .
Sweet Lady , shall I call you my Charge hereafter ?
I will not take upon me to govern your tongue Sir , you shall callme what you please .
Gobrias , Bacurius , Arane , Panthe , and Mandane,
My Lord Bacurius , you must have regard unto the Queen , she isyour prisoner , 't is at your peril if she make escape .
My Lord , I know't , she is my prisoner from you committed ; yet sheis a woman , and so I keep her safe , you will not urge me to keepher close , I shall not shame to say I sorrow for her .
So do I my Lord ; I sorrow for her , that so little grace dothgovern her : that she should stretch her arm against her King , solittle womanhood and natural goodness , as to think the death ofher own Son .
Thou knowst the reason why , dissembling as thou art , and wilt notspeak .
There is a Lady takes not after you , Her Father is within her , that good manWhose tears weigh 'd down his sins , mark how she weeps , How well it does become her , and if youCan find no disposition in your selfTo sorrow , yet by gracefulness in herFind out the way , and by your reason weep : All this she does for you , and more she needsWhen for your self you will not lose a tear , Think how this want of grief discredits you , And you will weep , because you can not weep .
You talk to me as having got a time fit for your purpose ; but youshould be urg 'd know I know you speak not what you think .
I would my heart were Stone , before my softnessAgainst my mother , a more troubled thoughtNo Virgin bears about ; should I excuseMy Mothers fault , I should set light a lifeIn losing which , a brother and a KingWere taken from me , if I seek to saveThat life so lov 'd , I lose another lifeThat gave me being , I shall lose a Mother , A word of such a sound in a childs earsThat it strikes reverence through it ; may the willOf heaven be done , and if one needs must fall , Take a poor Virgins life to answer all .
But Gobrias let us talk , you know this faultIs not in me as in another Mother .
I know it is not .
Yet you make it so .
Why , is not all that 's past beyond your help ?
I know it is .
Nay should you publish it before the world , Think you 'twould be believ 'd ?
I know it would not .
Nay should I joyn with you , should we not both be torn and yetboth die uncredited ?
I think we should .
Why then take you such violent courses ? As for me I do but rightin saving of the King from all your plots .
The King ?
I bad you rest with patience , and a timeWould come for me to reconcile all toYour own content , but by this way you takeAway my power , and what was done unknown , Was not by me but you : your urging being doneI must preserve my own , but time may bringAll this to light , and happily for all .
Accursed be this over curious brainThat gave that plot a birth , accurst this wombThat after did conceive to my disgrace .
My Lord Protector , they say there are divers Letters come from
, that Bessus has done good service , and brought againa day , by his particular valour , receiv 'd you any to that effect ?
Yes , 't is most certain .
I 'm sorry for't , not that the day was won , But that 't was won by him : we held him hereA Coward , he did me wrong once , at which I laugh 'd , And so did all the world , for nor I , Nor any other held him worth my sword .
Bessus and Spaconia .
Health to my Protector ; from the KingThese Letters ; and to your grace Madam , these .
How does his Majesty ?
As well as conquest by his own means and his valiantC [ o ] mmanders can make him ; your letters will tell you all .
I will not open mine till I do knowMy Brothers health : good Captain is he well ?
As the rest of us that fought are .
But how 's that ? is he hurt ?
He 's a strange souldier that gets not a knock .
I do not ask how strange that souldier isThat gets no hurt , but whether he have one .
He had divers .
And is he well again ?
Well again , a n't please your Grace : why I was run twice throughthe body , and shot i'th ' head with a cross-arrow , and yet am wellagain .
I do not care how thou do'st , is he well ?
Not care how I do ? Let a man out of the mightiness of his spirit , fructifie Foreign Countries with his blood for the good of hisown , and thus he shall be answered : Why I may live to relievewith spear and shield , such a Lady as you distressed .
Why , I will care , I'me glad that thou art well , I prethee is heso ?
The King is well and will be here to morrow .
My prayer is heard , now will I open mine .
, I must ease you of your charge : Madam , the wonted mercy of the King , That overtakes your faults , has met with this , And struck it out , he has forgiven you freely , Your own will is your law , be where you please .
I thank him .
You will be ready to wait upon his Majesty to morrow ?
I will. [ Exit Arane .
Madam be wise hereafter ; I am glad I have lost this Office .
Good Captain Bessus , tell us the discourse betwixt Tigranesand our King , and how we got the victory .
I prethee do , and if my Brother wereIn any danger , let not thy tale makeHim abide there long before thou bring him off , For all that while my heart will beat .
Madam let what will beat , I must tell the truth , and thus it was ; they fought single in lists , but one to one ; as for my own part , I was dangerously hurt but three days before , else , perhaps , wehad been two to two , I can not tell , some thought we had , and theoccasion of my hurt was this , the enemy had made Trenches .
Captain , without the manner of your hurt be much material to thisbusiness , we'l hear't some other time .
I prethee leave it , and go on with my Brother .
I will , but 'twould be worth your hearing : To theLists they came , and single-sword and gantlet was their fight .
Alas !
Without the Lists there stood some dozen Captains of either sidemingled , all which were sworn , and one of those was I : and 'twasmy chance to stand next a Captain o'th ' enemies side , called
; Valiant they said he was ; whilst these two Kingswere streaching themselves , this Tiribasus cast something ascornful look on me , and ask't me who I thought would overcome : Ismil 'd and told him if he would fight with me , he should perceiveby the event of that whose King would win : something he answered , and a scuffle was like to grow , when one Zipetus offered tohelp him , I --
All this is of thy self , I pray thee Bessus tell something ofmy Brother , did he nothing ?
Why yes , I'le tell your Grace , they were not to fight till theword given , which for my own part , by my troth I confess I wasnot to give .
See for his own part .
I fear yet this fellow 's abus 'd with a good report .
But I --
Still of himself .
Cri 'd give the word , when as some of them say , Tigranes wasstooping , but the word was not given then , yet one Cosroes ofthe enemies part , held up his finger to me , which is as much withus Martialists , as I will fight with you : I said not a word , normade sign during the combate , but that once done .
He slips o 're all the fight .
I call 'd him to me , Cosroes said I .
I will hear no more .
No , no , I lie .
I dare be sworn thou dost .
Captain said I , so it was .
I tell thee , I will hear no further .
No ? Your Grace will wish you had .
I will not wish it , what is this the LadyMy brother writes to me to take ?
And please your Grace this is she : Charge , will you come near thePrincess ?
You'r welcome from your Country , and this land shall shew untoyou all the kindness that I can make it ; what 's your name ?
Y'are very welcome , you have got a letter to put you to me , thathas power enough to place mine enemy here ; then much more youthat are so far from being so to me that you ne 're saw me .
Madam , I dare pass my word for her truth .
My truth ?
Why Captain , do you think I am afraid she'l steal ?
I can not tell , servants are slippery , but I dare give my word forher , and for honesty , she came along with me , and many favoursshe did me by the way , but by this light none but what she mightdo with modesty , to a man of my rank .
Why Captain , here 's no body thinks otherwise .
Nay , if you should , your Grace may think your pleasure ; but I amsure I brought her from Armenia , and in all that way , if ever Itouch 'd any bare of her above her knee , I pray God I may sinkwhere I stand .
Above my knee ?
No , you know I did not , and if any man will say , I did , thissword shall answer ; Nay , I'le defend the reputation of my chargewhilst I live , your Grace shall understand I am secret in thesebusinesses , and know how to defend a Ladies honour .
I hope your Grace knows him so well already , I shall not need totell you he 's vain and foolish .
I you may call me what you please , but I'le defend your good nameagainst the world ; and so I take my leave of your Grace , and ofyou my Lord Protector ; I am likewise glad to see your Lordshipwell .
O Captain Bessus , I thank you , I would speak with youanon .
When you please , I will attend your Lordship .
Madam , I'le take my leave too .
Good Bacurius. [ Exeunt Bes. and Bac .
Madam what writes his Majesty to you ?
O my Lord , the kindest words , I'le keep 'em whilst I live , herein my bosom , there 's no art in 'em , they lie disordered in thispaper , just as hearty nature speaks 'em .
And to me he writes what tears of joy he shed to hear how youwere grown in every vertues way , and yields all thanks to me , forthat dear care which I was bound to have in training you , thereis no Princess living that enjoys a brother of that worth .
My Lord , no maid longs more for any thing , And feels more heat and cold within her breast , Than I do now , in hopes to see him .
Yet I wonder muchAt this he writes , he brings along with himA husband for you , that same Captive Prince , And if he loves you as he makes a shew , He will allow you freedom in your choice .
And so he will my Lord , I warrant you , he will but offer and giveme the power to take or leave .
Trust me , were I a Lady , I could not like that man were bargain'dwith before I choose him .
But I am not built on such wild humours , if I find him worthy , heis not less because he 's offer 'd .
'T is true , he is not , would he would seem less .
I think there 's no Lady can affectAnother Prince , your brother standing by ; He doth Eclipse mens vertues so with his .
I know a Lady may , and more I fearAnother Lady will .
Would I might see him .
Why so you shall , my businesses are great , I will attend you when it is his pleasure to see you .
I thank you good my Lord .
You will be ready Madam. [ Exit Gob .
Yes .
I do beseech you Madam , send awayYour other women , and receive from meA few sad words , which set against your joyesMay make 'em shine the more .
Sirs , leave me all. [ Exeunt Women .
I kneel a stranger here to beg a thingUnfit for me to ask , and you to grant , 'T is such another strange ill-laid request , As if a begger should intreat a KingTo leave his Scepter , and his Throne to himAnd take his rags to wander o 're the worldHungry and cold .
That were a strange request .
As ill is mine .
Then do not utter it .
Alas 't is of that nature , that it mustBe utter 'd , I , and granted , or I die : I am asham 'd to speak it ; but where lifeLies at the stake , I can not think her womanThat will not take something unreasonably to hazard saving of it : I shall seem a strange Petitioner , that wish all ill to them Ibeg of , e 're they give me ought ; yet so I must : I would you werenot fair , nor wise , for in your ill consists my good : if you werefoolish , you would hear my prayer , if foul , you had not power tohinder me : he would not love you .
What 's the meaning of it .
Nay , my request is more without the boundsOf reason yet : for 't is not in the powerOf you to do , what I would have you grant .
Why then 't is idle , pray thee speak it out .
Your brother brings a Prince into this land , Of such a noble shape , so sweet a grace , So full of worth withal , that every maidThat looks upon him , gives away her selfTo him for ever ; and for you to haveHe brings him : and so mad is my demandThat I desire you not to have this man , This excellent man , for whom you needs must die , If you should miss him. I do now expectYou should laugh at me .
Trust me I could weep rather , for I have found himIn all thy words a strange disjoynted sorrow .
'T is by me his own desire so , that you would not love him .
His own desire ! why credit me Thalestris , I am no common wooer : if he shall wooe me , his worth may be such , that I dare not swearI will not love him ; but if he will stay to have me wooe him , Iwill promise thee , he may keep all his graces to himself , andfear no ravishing from me .
'T is yet his own desire , but when he sees your face , I fear itwill not be ; therefore I charge you as you have pity , stop thesetender ears from his enchanting voice , close up those eyes , thatyou may neither catch a dart from him , nor he from you ; I chargeyou as you hope to live in quiet ; for when I am dead , for certainI will walk to visit him if he break promise with me : for as fastas Oaths without a formal Ceremony can make me , I am to him .
Then be fearless ; For if he were a thing 'twixt God and man , I could gaze on him ; if I knew it sinTo love him without passion : Dry your eyes , I swear you shall enjoy him still for me , I will not hinder you ; but I perceiveYou are not what you seem , rise , rise Thalestris , If your right name be so .
Indeed it is not , Spaconia is my name ; but I desire not to beknown to other .
Why , by me you shall not , I will never do you wrong , what good Ican , I will , think not my birth or education such , that I shouldinjure a stranger Virgin ; you are welcome hither , in company youwish to be commanded , but when we are alone , I shall be ready tobe your servant. [ Exeunt .
Come , come , run , run , run .
We shall out-go her .

Is the King hard by ?
You heard he with the Bottles said , he thought we should come too
But what had he in those Bottles ?
I know not .
Why , Ink goodman fool .
Ink , what to do ?
Why the King look you , will many times call for theseBottles , and break his mind to his friends .
Let 's take our places , we shall have no room else .
The man told us he would walk o ' foot through the people .
I marry did he .
Our shops are well look't to now .

No 't is not he .
Lord how fine the fields be , what sweet living 't is in theCountry !
I poor souls , God help 'em ; they live as contentedly as one ofus .
My husbands Cousin would have had me gone into the Country lastyear , wert thou ever there ?
I , poor souls , I was amongst 'em once .
And what kind of creatures are they , for love of God ?
Very good people , God help 'em .
Wilt thou go down with me this Summer when I am brought to bed ?
Alas , it is no place for us .
Why , pray thee ?
Why you can have nothing there , there 's no body cryes brooms .
No ?
No truly , nor milk .
Nor milk , how do they ?
They are fain to milk themselves i'th ' Country .
Good Lord ! but the people there , I think , will be very dutiful toone of us .
I God knows will they , and yet they do not greatly care for ourhusbands .
Do they not ? Alas ! I'good faith I can not blame them : for we donot greatly care for them our selves. Philip , I pray choose usa place .
There 's the best forsooth .
By your leave good people a little .
What 's the matter ?
I pray you my friend , do not thrust my Mistress so , she 's withChild .
Let her look to her self then , has she not had showing enoughyet ? if she stay shouldring here , she may haps go home with acake in her belly .
How now , goodman squitter-breech , why do you lean on me ?
Because I will .
Will you Sir sawce-box ?
Look if one ha'not struck Philip , come hither Philip , why didhe strike thee ?
For leaning on him .
Why didst thou lean on him ?
I did not think he would have struck me .
As God save me la thou'rt as wild as a Buck , there 's no quarelbut thou'rt at one end or other o n't .
It 's at the first end then , for he'l ne'r stay the last .
Well slip-string , I shall meet with you .
When you will .
I'le give a crown to meet with you .
At a Bawdy-house .

God preserve your Majesty .
I thank you all , now are my joyes at full , when I behold yousafe , my loving Subjects ; by you I grow , 't is your united lovethat lifts me to this height : all the account that I can renderyou for all the love you have bestowed on me , all your expencesto maintain my war , is but a little word , you will imagine 'tisslender paiment , yet 't is such a word , as is not to be bought butwith your bloods , 't is Peace .
God preserve your Majesty .
Now you may live securely i'your Towns , Your Children round about you ; may sitUnder your Vines , and make the miseriesOf other Kingdoms a discourse for you , And lend them sorrows ; for your selves , you maySafely forget there are such things as tears , And you may all whose good thoughts I have gain 'd , Hold me unworthy , where I think my lifeA sacrifice too great to keep you thusIn such a calm estate .
God bless your Majesty .
See all good people , I have brought the man whose very name youfear 'd , a captive home ; behold him , 't is Tigranes ; in yourheart sing songs of gladness , and deliverance .
Out upon him .
How he looks .
Hang him , hang him .
These are sweet people .
Sir , you do me wrong , to render me a scorned spectacle to commonpeople .
It was so far from me to mean it so : if I have ought deserv 'd , myloving Subjects , let me beg of you , not to revile this Prince , inwhom there dwells all worth of which the name of a man iscapable , valour beyond compare , the terrour of his name hasstretcht it self where ever there is sun ; and yet for you Ifought with him single , and won him too ; I made his valour stoop , and brought that name soar 'd to so unbeliev 'd a height , to fallbeneath mine : this inspir 'd with all your loves , I did perform , and will for your content , be ever ready for a greater work .
The Lord bless your Majesty .
So he has made me amends now with a speech in commendation of
If there be any thing in which I mayDo good to any creature , here speak out ; For I must leave you : and it troubles me , That my occasions for the good of you , Are such as call me from you : else , my joyWould be to spend my days among you all.You shew your loves in these large multitudesThat come to meet me , I will pray for you , Heaven prosper you , that you may know old years , And live to see your childrens children sitAt your boards with plenty : when there isA want of any thing , let it be knownTo me , and I will be a Father to you : God keep you all. [ Flourish. Exeunt Kings and their Train .

I for God sake , I have not made a fire yet .
Away , away , all 's done .
Content , farewel Philip .
Away you halter-sack you .
will not fight , he 's afraid on 's face .
I marry am I afraid of my face .
Thou wouldst be Philip if thou sawst it in a glass ; it looks solike a Visour. [ Exeunt 2. , 3. , and Woman .
You'l be hang 'd sirra : Come Philip walk before us homewards ; did not his Majesty say he had brought us home Pease for all ourmoney ?
Yes marry did he .
They 're the first I heard of this year by my troth , I longed forsome of 'em : did he not say we should have some ?
Yes , and so we shall anon I warrant you have every one a peckbrought home to our houses .
Arbaces and Gobrias .
My Sister take it ill ?
Not very ill.Something unkindly she does take it Sir to haveHer Husband chosen to her hands .
Why Gobrias let her , I must have her know , my will and not herown must govern her : what will she marry with some slave at home ?
O she is far from any stubbornness , you much mistake her , and nodoubt will like where you would have her , but when you beholdher , you will be loth to part with such a jewel .
To part with her ? why Gobrias , art thou mad ? she is my Sister .
Sir , I know she is : but it were pity to make poor our Land , withsuch a beauty to enrich another .
Pish will she have him ?
I do hope she will not , I think she will Sir .
Were she my Father and my Mother too , and all the names for whichwe think folks friends , she should be forc't to have him when Iknow 't is fit : I will not hear her say she 's loth .
Heaven bring my purpose luckily to pass , you know 't is just , shewill not need constraint she loves you so .
How does she love me , speak ?
She loves you more than people love their health , that live by labour ; more than I could love a man that diedfor me , if he could live again .
She is not like her mother then .
O no , when you were in Armenia , I durst not let her know when you were hurt : For at the first on every little scratch , She kept her Chamber , wept , and could not eat , Till you were well , and many times the newsWas so long coming , that before we heardShe was as near her death , as you your health .
Alas poor soul , but yet she must be rul 'd ; I know not how I shall requite her well.I long to see her , have you sent for her , To tell her I am ready ?
Sir I have .
1 Gent , and Tigranes .
Sir , here is the Armenian King .
He 's welcome .
And the Queen-mother , and the Princess wait without .
Good Gobrias bring 'em in .
, you will think you are arriv'dIn a strange Land , where Mothers cast to poysonTheir only Sons ; think you you shall be safe ?
Too safe I am Sir .
Gobrias , Arane , Panthea , Spaconia , Bacurius , Mardonius and Bessus , and two Gentlemen .
As low as this I bow to you , and wouldAs low as is my grave , to shew a mindThankful for all your mercies .
O stand up , And let me kneel , the light will be asham'dTo see observance done to me by you .
You are my King .
You are my Mother , rise ; As far be all your faults from your own soul , As from my memory ; then you shall beAs white as innocence her self .
I cameOnly to shew my duty , and acknowledgeMy sorrows for my sins ; longer to stayWere but to draw eyes more attentivelyUpon my shame , that power that kept you safeFrom me , preserve you still .
Your own desires shall be your guide. [ Exit Arane .
Now let me die , since I have seen my Lord the KingReturn in safetie , I have seen all good that lifeCan shew me ; I have ne 're another wishFor Heaven to grant , nor were it fit I should ; For I am bound to spend my age to come , In giving thanks that this was granted me .
Why does not your Majesty speak ?
To whom ?
To the Princess .
Alas Sir , I am fearful , you do lookOn me , as if I were some loathed thingThat you were finding out a way to shun .
Sir , you should speak to her .
Ha ?
I know I am unworthy , yet not ill arm 'd , with which innocencehere I will kneel , till I am one with earth , but I will gain somewords and kindness from you .
Will you speak Sir ?
Speak , am I what I was ? What art thou that dost creep into my breast , And dar'st not see my face ? shew forth thy self : I feel a pair of fiery wings displai'dHither , from hence ; you shall not tarry there , Up , and be gone , if thou beest Love be gone : Or I will tear thee from my wounded breast , Pull thy lov 'd Down away , and with thy QuillBy this right arm drawn from thy wonted wing , Write to thy laughing Mother i'thy bloud , That you are powers bely 'd , and all your dartsAre to be blown away , by men resolv 'd , Like dust ; I know thou fear'st my words , away .
O misery ! why should he be so slow ? There can no falshood come of loving her ; Though I have given my faith ; she is a thingBoth to be lov 'd and serv 'd beyond my faith : I would he would present me to her quickly .
Will you not speak at all ? are you so farFrom kind words ? yet to save my modesty , That must talk till you answer , do not standAs you were dumb , say something , though it bePoyson 'd with anger , that it may strike me dead .
Have you no life at all ? for man-hood sakeLet her not kneel , and talk neglected thus ; A tree would find a tongue to answer her , Did she but give it such a lov 'd respect .
You mean this Lady : lift her from the earth ; why do you let herkneel so long ? Alas , Madam , your beauty uses to command , and notto beg. What is your sute to me ? it shall be granted , yet thetime is short , and my affairs are great : but where 's my Sister ? Ibade she should be brought .
What , is he mad ?
Gobrias , where is she ?
Sir .
Where is she man ?
Who , Sir ?
Who , hast thou forgot my Sister ?
Your Sister , Sir ?
Your Sister , Sir ? some one that hath a wit , answer , where is she ?
Do you not see her there ?
Where ?
There .
There , where ?
S'light , there , are you blind ?
Which do you mean , that little one ?
No Sir .
No Sir ? why , do you mock me ? I can seeNo other here , but that petitioning Lady .
That 's she .
Away .
Sir , it is she .
'T is false .
Is it ?
As hell , by Heaven , as false as hell , My Sister : is she dead ? if it be so , Speak boldly to me ; for I am a man , And dare not quarrel with Divinity ; And do not think to cozen me with this : I see you all are mute and stand amaz 'd , Fearful to answer me ; it is too true , A decreed instant cuts off ev'ry life , For which to mourn , is to repine ; she dy'dA Virgin , though more innocent than sheep , As clear as her own eyes , and blessednessEternal waits upon her where she is : I know she could not make a wish to changeHer state for new , and you shall see me bearMy crosses like a man ; we all must die , And she hath taught us how .
Do not mistake , And vex your self for nothing ; for her deathIs a long life off , I hope : 'T is she , And if my speech deserve not faith , lay deathUpon me , and my latest words shall forceA credit from you .
Which , good Gobrias ? that Lady dost thou mean ?
That Lady Sir , She is your Sister , and she is your SisterThat loves you so , 't is she for whom I weep , To see you use her thus .
It can not be .
Pish , this is tedious , I can not hold , I must present my self , And yet the sight of my SpaconiaTouches me , as a sudden thunder-clapDoes one that is about to sin .
Away , No more of this ; here I pronounce him Traytor , The direct plotter of my death , that namesOr thinks her for my Sister , 't is a lie , The most malicious of the world , inventedTo mad your King ; he that will say so next , Let him draw out his sword and sheath it here , It is a sin fully as pardonable : She is no kin to me , nor shall she be ; If she were ever , I create her none : And which of you can question this ? My powerIs like the Sea , that is to be obey 'd , And not disputed with : I have decreed herAs far from having part of blood with me , As the nak 'd indians ; come and answer me , He that is boldest now ; is that my Sister ?
O this is fine .
No marry , she is not , a n't please your Majesty , I never thought she was , she 's nothing like you .
No 't is true , she is not .
Thou shou'dst be hang 'd .
Sir , I will speak but once ; by the same powerYou make my blood a stranger unto yours , You may command me dead , and so much loveA stranger may importune , pray you do ; If this request appear too much to grant , Adopt me of some other Family , By your unquestion 'd word ; else I shall liveLike sinfull issues that are left in streetsBy their regardless Mothers , and no nameWill be found for me .
I will hear no more , Why should there be such musick in a voyce , And sin for me to hear it ? All the worldMay take delight in this , and 't is damnationFor me to do so : You are fair and wiseAnd vertuous I think , and he is blestThat is so near you as my brother is ; But you are nought to me but a disease ; Continual torment without hope of ease ; Such an ungodly sickness I have got , That he that undertakes my cure , must firstO'rethrow Divinity , all moral Laws , And leave mankind as unconfin 'd as beasts , Allowing 'em to do all actionsAs freely as they drink when they desire.Let me not hear you speak again ; yet seeI shall but lang [ u ] ish for the want of that , The having which , would kill me : No man hereOffer to speak for her ; for I considerAs much as you can say ; I will not toilMy body and my mind too , rest thou there , Here 's one within will labour for you both .
I would I were past speaking .
Fear not Madam , The King will alter , 't is some sudden rage , And you shall see it end some other way .
Pray heaven it do .
Though she to whom I swore , be here , I cannotStifle my passion longer ; if my fatherShould rise again disquieted with this , And charge me to forbear , yet it would out.Madam , a stranger , and a pris'ner begsTo be bid welcome .
You are welcome , Sir , I think , but if you be not , 't is past meTo make you so : for I am here a stranger , Greater than you ; we know from whence you come , But I appear a lost thing , and by whomIs yet uncertain , found here i'th ' Court , And onely suffer 'd to walk up and down , As one not worth the owning .
O , I fear
will be caught , he looks , me-thinks , As he would change his eyes with her ; some helpThere is above for me , I hope .
Why do you turn away , and weep so fast , And utter things that mis-become your looks , Can you want owning ?
O 't is certain so .
Acknowledge your self mine .
How now ?
And then see if you want an owner .
They are talking .
Nations shall owne you for their Queen .
, art not thou my prisoner ?
I am .
And who is this ?
She is your Sister .
She is so .
Is she so again ? that 's well .
And then how dare you offer to change words with her ?
Dare do it ! Why ? you brought me hither Sir , To that intent .
Perhaps I told you so , If I had sworn it , had you so much follyTo credit it ? The least word that she speaksIs worth a life ; rule your disordered tongue , Or I will temper it .
Blest be the breath .
Temper my tongue ! such incivilitiesAs these , no barbarous people ever knew : You break the lawes of Nature , and of Nations , You talk to me as if I were a prisonerFor theft : my tongue be temper 'd ? I must speakIf thunder check me , and I will .
You will ?
Alas my fortune .
Do not fear his frown , dear Madam , hear me .
Fear not my frown ? but that 'twere base in meTo fight with one I know I can o'recome , Again thou shouldst be conquer 'd by me .
He has one ransome with him already ; me-thinks'T were good to fight double , or quit .
Away with him to prison : Now Sir , seeIf my frown be regardless ; Why delay you ? Seise him Bacurius , you shall know my wordSweeps like a wind , and all it grapples with , Are as the chaffe before it .
Touch me not .
Help there .
Away .
It is in vain to struggle .
You must be forc 'd .
Sir , you must pardon us , we must obey .
Why do you dally there ? drag him awayBy any thing .
Come Sir .
Justice , thou ought'st to give me strength enoughTo shake all these off ; This is tyrannie,
, sutler than the burning Bulls , Or that fam 'd Titans bed. Thou mightst as wellSearch i'th ' deep of Winter through the snowFor half starv 'd people , to bring home with thee , To shew 'em fire , and send 'em back again , As use me thus .
Let him be close , Bacurius. [ Exeunt Tigr. And Bac .
I ne 're rejoyc 'd at any ill to him , But this imprisonment : what shall becomeOf me forsaken ?
You will not let your SisterDepart thus discontented from you , Sir ?
By no means Gobrias , I have done her wrong , And made my self believe much of my self , That is not in me : You did kneel to me , Whilest I stood stubborn and regardless by , And like a god incensed , gave no earTo all your prayers : behold , I kneel to you , Shew a contempt as large as was my own , And I will suffer it , yet at the last forgive me .
O you wrong me more in this , Than in your rage you did : you mock me now .
Never forgive me then , which is the worstCan happen to me .
If you be in earnest , Stand up and give me but a gentle look , And two kind words , and I shall be in heaven .
Rise you then to hear ; I acknowledge theeMy hope , the only jewel of my life , The best of Sisters , dearer than my breath , A happiness as high as I could think ; And when my actions call thee otherwise , Perdition light upon me .
This is betterThan if you had not frown 'd , it comes to me , Like mercie at the block , and when I leaveTo serve you with my life , your curse be with me .
Then thus I do salute thee , and again , To make this knot the stronger , ParadiseIs there : It may be you are yet in doubt , This third kiss blots it out , I wade in sin , And foolishly intice my self along ; Take her away , see her a prisonerIn her own chamber closely , Gobrias .
Alas Sir , why ?
I must not stay the answer , doe it .
Good Sir .
No more , doe it I say .
This is better and better .
Yet hear me speak .
I will not hear you speak , Away with her , let no man think to speakFor such a creature ; for she is a witch , A prisoner , and a Traitor .
Madam , this office grieves me .
Nay , 't is well the king is pleased with it .
, go you along too with her ; I will proveAll this that I have said , if I may liveSo long ; but I am desperately sick , For she has given me poison in a kiss ; She had't betwixt her lips , and with her eyesShe witches people : go without a word. [ Exeunt Gob. Pan. Bes. And Spaconia.Why should you that have made me stand in warLike fate it self , cutting what threds I pleas 'd , Decree such an unworthy end of me , And all my glories ? What am I , alas , That you oppose me ? if my secret thoughtsHave ever harbour 'd swellings against you , They could not hurt you , and it is in youTo give me sorrow , that will render meApt to receive your mercy ; rather so , Let it be rather so , than punish meWith such unmanly sins : Incest is in meDwelling already , and it must be holyThat pulls it thence , where art Mardonius ?
Here Sir .
I pray thee bear me , if thou canst , Am I not grown a strange weight ?
As you were .
No heavier ?
No Sir .
Why , my legsRefuse to bear my body ; O Mardonius , Thou hast in field beheld me , when thou knowstI could have gone , though I could never run .
And so I shall again .
O no , 't is past .
Pray you go rest your self .
Wilt thou hereafter when they talk of me , As thou shalt hear nothing but infamy , Remember some of those things ?
Yes I will .
I pray thee do : for thou shalt never see me so again. [ Exeunt .
They talk of fame , I have gotten it in the wars ; and will affordany man a reasonable penny-worth : some will say , they could becontent to have it , but that it is to be atchiev 'd with danger ; but my opinion is otherwise : for if I might stand still inCannon-proof , and have fame fall upon me , I would refuse it : myreputation came principally by thinking to run away , which nobody knows but Mardonius , and I think he conceals it to angerme. Before I went to the warrs , I came to the Town a youngfellow , without means or parts to deserve friends ; and my emptyguts perswaded me to lie , and abuse people for my meat , which Idid , and they beat me : then would I fast two days , till myhunger cri 'd out on me , rail still , then me-thought I had amonstrous stomach to abuse 'em again , and did it. I , this state Icontinu 'd till they hung me up by th ' heels , and beat me wi'hasle sticks , as if they would have baked me , and have cousen'dsome body wi'me for Venison : After this I rail 'd , and eat
whipt fellow , and what I said was remembred in mirth but never inanger , of which I was glad ; I would it were at that pass again.After this , heaven calls an Aunt of mine , that left two hundredpound in a cousins hand for me , who taking me to be a gallantyoung spirit , raised a company for me with the money and sent meinto Armenia with 'em : Away I would have run from them , butthat I could get no company , and alone I durst not run. I wasnever at battail but once , and there I was running , but
cudgel 'd me ; yet I got loose at last , but was sofraid , that I saw no more than my shoulders doe , but fled with mywhole company amongst my Enemies , and overthrew 'em : Now thereport of my valour is come over before me , and they say I was araw young fellow , but now I am improv 'd , a Plague on theireloquence , 't will cost me many a beating ; And Mardonius mighthelp this too , if he would ; for now they think to get honour onme , and all the men I have abus 'd call me freshly worthily , asthey call it by the way of challenge .
Good morrow , Captain Bessus .
Good morrow Sir .
I come to speak with you .
You 're very welcome .
From one that holds himself wrong 'd by you somethree years since : your worth he says is fam 'd , and he dothnothing doubt but you will do him right , as beseems a souldier .
A pox on 'em , so they cry all .
And a slight note I have about me for you , for the delivery ofwhich you must excuse me ; it is an office that friendship callsupon me to do , and no way offensive to you ; since I desire butright on both sides .
'T is a challenge Sir , is it not ?
'T is an inviting to the field .
An inviting ? O Sir your Mercy , what a Complement he delivers itwith ? he might as agreeable to my nature present me poison withsuch a speech : um um um reputation , um um um call you to account , um um um forc 'd to this , um um um with my Sword , um um um like aGentleman , um um um dear to me , um um um satisfaction : 'T is verywell Sir , I do accept it , but he must await an answer thisthirteen weeks .
Why Sir , he would be glad to wipe off his stain as soon as hecould .
Sir upon my credit I am already ingag 'd to two hundred , andtwelve , all which must have their stains wip 'd off , if that bethe word , before him .
Sir , if you be truly ingag 'd but to one , he shall stay acompetent time .
Upon my faith Sir , to two hundred and twelve , and I have a spentbody , too much bruis 'd in battel , so that I can not fight , I mustbe plain , above three combats a day : All the kindness I can shewhim , is to set him resolvedly in my rowle , the two hundred andthirteenth man , which is something , for I tell you , I think therewill be more after him , than before him , I think so ; pray youcommend me to him , and tell him this .
I will Sir , good morrow to you. [ Exit 3 Gent .
Good morrow good Sir. Certainly my safest way were to print myself a coward , with a discovery how I came by my credit , and clapit upon every post ; I have received above thirty challengeswithin this two hours , marry all but the first I put off withingagement , and by good fortune , the first is no madder offighting than I , so that that 's referred , the place where it mustbe ended , is four days journey off , and our arbitratours are
friend with a quartain ague , like to hold him this five years , for mine : and when his man comes home , we are to expect myfriends health : If they would finde me challenges thus thick , aslong as I liv 'd , I would have no other living ; I can make sevenshillings a day o'th ' paper to the Grocers : yet I learn nothingby all these but a little skill in comparing of stiles. I dofinde evidently , that there is some one Scrivener in this Town , that has a great hand in writing of Challenges , for they are allof a cut , and six of 'em in a hand ; and they all end , myreputation is dear to me , and I must require satisfaction : Who'sthere ? more paper I hope , no , 't is my Lord Bacurius , I fear allis not well betwixt us .
Bacurius .
Now Captain Bessus , I come about a frivolous matter , caus 'd byas idle a report : you know you were a coward .
Very right .
And wronged me .
True my Lord .
But now people will call you valiant , desertlesly I think , yetfor their satisfaction , I will have you fight with me .
O my good Lord , my deep Engagements .
Tell not me of your Engagements , Captain Bessus , it is not tobe put off with an excuse : for my own part , I am none of themultitude that believe your conversion from Coward .
My Lord , I seek not Quarrels , and this belongs not to me , I amnot to maintain it .
Who then pray ?
the Coward wrong 'd you .
Right .
And shall Bessus the Valiant , maintain what Bessus the Cowarddid ?
I pray thee leave these cheating tricks , I swear thou shalt fightwith me , or thou shall be beaten extreamly , and kick 'd .
Since you provoke me thus far , my Lord , I will fight with you , and by my Sword it shall cost me twenty pound , but I will have myLeg well a week sooner purposely .
Your Leg ? Why , what ailes your Leg ? i'le do a cure on you , standup .
My Lord , this is not Noble in you .
What dost thou with such a phrase in thy mouth ? I will kick theeout of all good words before I leave thee .
My Lord , I take this as a punishment for the offence I did when Iwas a Coward .
When thou wert ? Confess thy self a Coward still , or by thislight , I'le beat thee into Spunge .
Why I am one .
Are you so Sir ? And why do you wear a Sword then ? Come unbuckle .
My Lord .
Unbuckle I say , and give it me , or as I live , thy head will akeextreamly .
It is a pretty Hilt , and if your Lordship take an affection toit , with all my heart I present it to you for a New-years-gift .
I thank you very heartily , sweet Captain , farewel .
One word more , I beseech your Lordship to render me my knifeagain .
Marry by all means Captain ; cherish your self with it , and eathard , good Captain ; we can not tell whether we shall have any more
[ Exit Bac .
I will make better use of this , than of my Sword : A base spirithas this vantage of a brave one , it keeps alwayes at a stay , nothing brings it down , not beating. I remember I promis 'd theKing in a great Audience , that I would make my back-biters eat mysword to a knife ; how to get another sword I know not , nor knowany means left for me to maintain my credit , but impudence : therefore I will out-swear him and all his followers , that thisis all that 's left uneaten of my sword. [ Exit Bessus .
Mardonius .
I'le move the King , he is most strangely alter 'd ; I guess thecause I fear too right , Heaven has some secret end i n't , and 'tisa scourge no question justly laid upon him : he has followed methrough twenty Rooms ; and ever when I stay to wait his command , he blushes like a Girl , and looks upon me , as if modesty kept inhis business : so turns away from me , but if I go on , he followsme again .
Arbaces.See , here he is. I do not use this , yet I know not how , I cannotchuse but weep to see him ; his very Enemies I think , whose woundshave bred his fame , if they should see him now , would find tearsi'their eyes .
I can not utter it , why should I keepA breast to harbour thoughts ? I dare not speak.Darkness is in my bosom , and there lieA thousand thoughts that can not brook the light : How wilt thou vex 'em when this deed is done , Conscience , that art afraid to let me name it ?
How do you Sir ?
Why very well Mardonius , how dost thou do ?
Better than you I fear .
I hope thou art ; for to be plain with thee , Thou art in Hell else , secret scorching flamesThat far transcend earthly material firesAre crept into me , and there is no cure.Is it not strange Mardonius , there 's no cure ?
Sir , either I mistake , or there is something hidThat you would utter to me .
So there is , but yet I can not do it .
Out with it Sir , if it be dangerous , I will not shrink to do youservice , I shall not esteem my life a weightier matter thanindeed it is , I know it is subject to more chances than it hashours , and I were better lose it in my Kings cause , than with anague , or a fall , or sleeping , to a Thief ; as all these areprobable enough : let me but know what I shall do for you .
It will not out : were you with Gobrias , And bad him give my Sister all contentThe place affords , and give her leave to sendAnd speak to whom she please ?
Yes Sir , I was .
And did you to Bacurius say as muchAbout Tigranes ?
Yes .
That 's all my business .
O say not so , You had an answer of this before ; Besides I think this business mightBe utter 'd more carelesly .
Come thou shalt have it out , I do beseech theeBy all the love thou hast profest to me , To see my Sister from me .
Well , and what ?
That 's all .
That 's strange , I shall say nothing to her ?
Not a word ; But if thou lovest me , find some subtil wayTo make her understand by signs .
But what shall I make her understand ?
O Mardonius , for that I must be pardon 'd .
You may , but I can only see her then .
'T is true ; Bear her this Ring then , andOne more advice , thou shall speak to her : Tell her I do love My kindred all : wilt thou ?
Is there no more ?
O yes and her the best ; Better than any Brother loves his Sister : That 's all .
Methinks this need not have been delivered with such a caution ; I'le do it .
There is more yet , Wilt thou be faith [ f ] ul to me ?
Sir , if I take upon me to deliver it , after I hear it , I'le passthrough fire to do it .
I love her better than a Brother ought ; Dost thou conceive me ?
I hope you do not Sir .
No , thou art dull , kneel down before her , And ne'r rise again , till she will love me .
Why , I think she does .
But better than she does , another way ; As wives love Husbands .
Why , I think there are few Wives that love theirHusbands better than she does you .
Thou wilt not understand me : is it fitThis should be uttered plainly ? take it thenNaked as it is : I would desire her loveLasciviously , lewdly , incestuously , To do a sin that needs must damn us both , And thee too : dost thou understand me now ?
Yes , there 's your Ring again ; what have I doneDishonestly in my whole life , name it , That you should put so base a business to me ?
Didst thou not tell me thou wouldst do it ?
Yes ; if I undertook it , but if allMy hairs were lives , I would not be engag'dIn such a case to save my last life .
O guilt ! ha how poor and weak a thing art thou ! This man that is my servant , whom my breathMight blow upon the world , might beat me hereHaving this cause , whil'st I prest down with sinCould not resist him : hear Mardonius , It was a motion mis-beseeming man , And I am sorry for it .
Heaven grant you may be so : you must understand , nothing that youcan utter , can remove my love and service from my Prince. Butotherwise , I think I shall not love you more. For you are sinful , and if you do this crime , you ought to have no Laws. For afterthis , it will be great injustice in you to punish any offenderfor any crime. For my self I find my heart too big : I feel I havenot patience to look on whilst you run these forbidden courses.Means I have none but your favour , and I am rather glad that Ishall lose 'em both together , than keep 'em with such conditions ; I shall find a dwelling amongst some people , where though ourGarments perhaps be courser , we shall be richer far within , andharbour no such vices in 'em : the Gods preserve you , and mend .
, stay Mardonius , for thoughMy present state requires nothing but knavesTo be about me , such as are prepar'dFor every wicked act , yet who does knowBut that my loathed Fate may turn about , And I have use for honest men again ? I hope I may , I prethee leave me not .
Bessus .
Where is the King ?
There .
A n't please your Majesty , there 's the knife .
What knife ?
The Sword is eaten .
Away you fool , the King is serious , And can not now admit your vanities .
Vanities ! I'me no honest man , if my enemies have not brought itto this , what , do you think I lie ?
No , no , 't is well Bessus , 't is very well I 'm glad o n't .
If your enemies brought it to this , your enemies are Cutlers , come leave the King .
Why , may not valour approach him ?
Yes , but he has affairs , depart , or I shall be somethingunmannerly with you .
No , let him stay Mardonius , let him stay , I have occasion with him very weighty , And I can spare you now .
Sir ?
Why I can spare you now .
give way to these State affairs .
Indeed you are fitter for this present purpose. [ Exit Mar .
, I should imploy thee , wilt thou do't ?
Do't for you ? by this Air I will do any thing without exception , be it a good , bad , or indifferent thing .
Do not swear .
By this light but I will , any thing whatsoever .
But I shall name the thing , Thy Conscience will not suffer thee to do .
I would fain hear that thing .
Why I would have thee get my Sister for me ? Thou understandst me , in a wicked manner .
O you would have a bout with her ? I'le do't , I'le do't , I'faith .
Wilt thou , do'st thou make no more o n't ? Bes. More ? no , why isthere any thing else ? if there be , it shall be done too .
Hast thou no greater sense of such a sin ? Thou art too wicked for my company , Though I have hell within me , thou may'st yetCorrupt me further : pray thee answer me , How do I shew to thee after this motion ?
Why your Majesty looks as well in my opinion , as ever you didsince you were born .
But thou appear'st to me after thy grant , The ugliest , loathed detestable thingThat I ever met with. Thou hast eyesLike the flames of Sulphur , which me thinks do dartInfection on me , and thou hast a mouthEnough to take me in where there do standFour rows of Iron Teeth .
I feel no such thing , but 't is no matter how I look , Pie do mybusiness as well as they that look better , and when this isdispatch 'd , if you have a mind to your Mother , tell me , and youshall see I'le set it hard .
My Mother ! Heaven forgive me to hear this , I am inspir 'd with horrour : now I hate theeWorse than my sin , which if I could come byShould suffer death Eternal ne 're to riseIn any breast again. Know I will dieLanguishing mad , as I resolve , I shall , E 're I will deal by such an instrument : Thou art too sinful to imploy in this ; Out of the World , away .
What do you mean , Sir ?
Hung round with Curses , take thy fearful flightInto the Desarts , where 'mongst all the MonstersIf thou find'st one so beastly as thy self , Thou shalt be held as innocent .
Good Sir .
If there were no such instruments as thou , We Kings could never act such wicked deeds : Seek out a man that mocks Divinity , That breaks each precept both of God and man , And natures too , and does it without lust , Meerly because it is a law , and good , And live with him : for him thou canst not spoil.Away I say , I will not do this sin. [ Exit Bessus.I'le press it here , till it do break my breast , It heaves to get out , but thou art a sin , And spight of torture I will keep thee in .

Have you written Madam ?
Yes , good Gobrias .
And with a kindness , and such winning wordsAs may provoke him , at one instant feelHis double fault , your wrong , and his own rashness ?
I have sent words enough , if words may win himFrom his displeasure ; and such words I hope , As shall gain much upon his goodness , Gobrias.Yet fearing they are many , and a womans , A poor belief may follow , I have wovenAs many truths within 'em to speak for me , That if he be but gracious , and receive 'em --
Good Lady be not fearful , though he should notGive you your present end in this , believe it , You shall feel , if your vertue can induce youTo labour o n't , this tempest which I know , Is but a poor proof 'gainst your patience : All those contents , your spirit will arrive at , Newer and sweeter to you ; your Royal brother , When he shall once collect himself , and seeHow far he has been asunder from himself ; What a meer stranger to his golden temper : Must from those roots of vertue , never dying , Though somewhat stopt with humour , shoot againInto a thousand glories , bearing his fair branchesHigh as our hopes can look at , straight as justice , Loaden with ripe contents ; he loves you dearly , I know it , and I hope I need not fartherWin you to understand it .
I believe it.But howsoever , I am sure I love him dearly : So dearly , that if any thing I writeFor my enlarging should beget his anger , Heaven be a witness with me and my faith , I had rather live intomb 'd here .
You shall not feel a worse stroke than your grief , I am sorry 't is so sharp , I kiss your hand , And this night will deliver this true story , With this hand to your Brother .
Peace go with you , you are a good man. [ Exit Gob.My Spaconia , why are you ever sad thus ?
O dear Lady .
Prethee discover not a way to sadness , Nearer than I have in me , our two sorrowsWork like two eager Hawks , who shall get highest ; How shall I lessen thine ? for mine I fearIs easier known than cur 'd .
Heaven comfort both , And give you happy ends , however IFall in my stubborn fortunes .
This but teachesHow to be more familiar with our sorrows , That are too much our masters : good SpaconiaHow shall I do you service ?
Noblest Lady , You make me more a slave still to your goodness , And only live to purchase thanks to pay you , For that is all the business of my life : nowI will be bold , since you will have it so , To ask a noble favour of you .
Speak it , 't is yours , for from so sweet a vertue , No ill demand has issue .
Then ever vertuous , let me beg your willIn helping me to see the Prince Tigranes , With whom I am equal prisoner , if not more .
Reserve me to a greater end Spaconia ;
can not want so much good mannersAs to deny your gentle visitation , Though you came only with your own command .
I know they will deny me gracious Madam , Being a stranger , and so little fam 'd , So utter empty of those excellenciesThat tame Authority ; but in you sweet Lady , All these are natural ; beside , a powerDeriv 'd immediate from your Royal brother , Whose least word in you may command the Kingdom .
More than my word Spaconia , you shall carry , For fear it fail you .
Dare you trust a Token ? Madam I fear I am grown too bold a begger .
You are a pretty one , and trust me LadyIt joyes me , I shall do a good to you , Though to my self I never shall be happy : Here , take this Ring , and from me as a TokenDeliver it ; I think they will not stay you : So all your own desires go with you Lady .

Nay , more , the King Sir .

Have you been carefull of our noble Prisoner , That he want nothing fitting for his greatness ?
I hope his grace will quit me for my care Sir .
'T is well , royal Tigranes , health .
More than the strictness of this place can give Sir , I offer back again to great Arbaces .
We thank you worthy Prince , and pray excuse us , We have not seen you since your being here , I hope your noble usage has been equallWith your own person : your imprisonment , If it be any , I dare say is easie , And shall not last t [ w ] o dayes .
I thank you ; My usage here has been the same it was , Worthy a royal Conqueror. For my restraint , It came unkindly , because much unlook 'd for ; But I must bear it .
What Lady 's that ? Bacurius ?
One of the Princess women , Sir .
I fear 'd it , why comes she hither ?
To speak with the Prince Tigranes .
From whom , Bacurius ?
From the Princess , Sir .
I knew I had seen her .
His fit begins to take him now again , 'T is a strange Feaver , and 'twill shake us all anon , I fear , Would he were well cur 'd of this raging folly : Give me the warrs , where men are mad , and may talk what theylist , and held the bravest fellows ; This pelting prating peace isgood for nothing : drinking 's a vertue to't .
I see there 's truth in no man , nor obedience , But for his own ends , why did you let her in ?
It was your own command to barr none from him , Besides , the Princess sent her ring Sir , for my warrant .
A token to Tigranes , did she not ? Sir tell truth .
I do not use to lie Sir , 'T is no way I eat or live by , and I think , This is no token Sir .
This combat has undone him : if he had been well beaten , he hadbeen temperate ; I shall never see him handsome again , till hehave a Horse-mans staffe yok 'd thorow his shoulders , or an armbroken with a bullet .
I am trifled with .
Sir ?
I know it , as I know thee to be false .
Now the clap comes .
You never knew me so , Sir I dare speak it , And durst a worse man tell me , though my better --
'T is well said , by my soul .
Sirra , you answer as you had no life .
That I fear Sir to lose nobly .
I say Sir , once again .
You may say what yo [ u ] please , Sir , Would I might do so .
I will , Sir , and say openly , this woman carries letters , By my life I know she carries letters , this woman does it .
Would Bessus were here to take her aside and search her , Hewould quickly tell you what she carried Sir .
I have found it out , this woman carries letters .
If this hold , 'twill be an ill world for Bawdes , Chamber-maidsand Post-boyes , I thank heaven I have none I but his letterspatents , things of his own enditing .
Prince , this cunning can not do't .
Doe , What Sir ? I reach you not .
It shall not serve your turn , Prince .
Serve my turn Sir ?
I Sir , it shall not serve your turn .
Be plainer , good Sir .
This woman shall carry no more letters back to yourLove Panthea , by Heaven she shall not , I say she shall not .
This would make a Saint swear like a souldier .
This beats me more , King , than the blowes you gave me .
Take'em away both , and together let them prisoners be , strictlyand closely kept , or Sirra , your life shall answer it , and letno body speak with'em hereafter .
Well , I am subject to you , And must indure these passions : This is the imprisonment I have look 'd for always.And the dearer place I would choose. [ Exeunt Tigr. Spa. Bac .
Sir , you have done well now .
Dare you reprove it ?
No .
You must be crossing me .
I have no letters Sir to anger you , But a dry sonnet of my CorporalsTo an old Suttlers wife , and that I 'll burn , Sir.'Tis like to prove a fine age for the Ignorant .
How darst thou so often forfeit thy life ? Thou know'st 't is in my power to take it .
Yes , and I know you wo'not , or if you doe , you 'll miss itquickly .
Why ?
Who shall tell you of these childish folliesWhen I am dead ? who shall put to his powerTo draw those vertues out of a flood of humors , When they are drown 'd , and make'em shine again ? No , cut my head off : Then you may talk , and be believed , and grow worse , And have your too self-glorious temper rotInto a deep sleep , and the Kingdom with you , Till forraign swords be in your throats , and slaughterBe every where about you like your flatterers.Do , kill me .
Prethee be tamer , good Mardonius , Thou know'st I love thee , nay I honour thee , Believe it good old Souldier , I am thine ; But I am rack 'd clean from my self , bear with me , Woot thou bear with me my Mardonius ?
Gobrias .
There comes a good man , love him too , he 's temperate , You may live to have need of such a vertue , Rage is not still in fashion .
Welcome good Gobrias .
My service and this letter to your Grace .
From whom ?
From the rich Mine of vertue and beauty , Your mournfull Sister .
She is in prison , Gobrias , is she not ?
She is Sir , till your pleasure to enlarge her , Which on my knees I beg. Oh 't is not fit , That all the sweetness of the world in one , The youth and vertue that would tame wild Tygers , And wilder people , that have known no manners , Should live thus cloistred up ; for your loves sake , If there be any in that noble heart , To her a wretched Lady , and forlorn , Or for her love to you , which is as muchAs nature and obedience ever gave , Have pity on her beauties .
Pray thee stand up ; 'T is true , she is too fair , And all these commendations but her own , Would thou had'st never so commended her , Or I nere liv 'd to have heard it Gobrias ; If thou but know'st the wrong her beautie does her , Thou wouldst in pity of her be a lyar , Thy ignorance has drawn me wretched man , Whither my self nor thou canst well tell : O my fate ! I think she loves me , but I fear anotherIs deeper in her heart : How thinkst thou Gobrias ?
I do beseech your Grace believe it not , For let me perish if it be not false. Good Sir , read her Letter .
This Love , or what a devil it is I know not , begets more mischiefthan a Wake. I had rather be well beaten , starv 'd , or lowsie , than live within the Air on't. He that had seen this brave fellowCharge through a grove of Pikes but t'other day , and look uponhim now , will ne'r believe his eyes again : if he continue thusbut two days more , a Taylor may beat him with one hand tiedbehind him .
Alas , she would be at liberty.And there be a thousand reasons Gobrias , Thousands that will deny't : Which if she knew , she would contentedlyBe where she is : and bless her vertues for it , And me , though she were closer , she would , Gobrias , Good man indeed she would .
Then good Sir , for her satisfaction , Send for her and with reason make her knowWhy she must live thus from you .
I will ; go bring her to me. [ Exeunt all .
Bessus , And two Sword-men , and a Boy .
Y'are very welcome both ; some stools boy , And reach a Table ; Gentlemen o'th ' Sword , Pray sit without more complement ; be gone child.I have been curious in the searching of you , Because I understand you wise and valiant persons .
We understand our selves Sir .
Nay Gentlemen , and dear friends o'th ' Sword , No complement I pray , but to the causeI hang upon , which in few , is my honour .
You can not hang too much Sir , for your honour , But to your cause .
Be wise , and speak truth , my first doubt is , My beating by my Prince .
Stay there a little Sir , do you doubt a beating ? Or have you had a beating by your Prince ?
Gentlemen o'th ' Sword , my Prince has beaten me .
Brother , what think you of this case ?
If he has beaten him , the case is clear .
If he have beaten him , I grant the case ; But how ? we can not be too subtil in this business , I say , but how ?
Even with his Royal hand .
Was it a blow of love , or indignation ?
'T was twenty blows of indignation , Gentlemen , Besides two blows o'th face .
Those blows o'th ' face have made a new cause o n't , The rest were but an horrible rudeness .
Two blows o'th ' face , and given by a worse man , I must confess , as the Sword-men say , had turn 'd the business : Mark me brother , by a worse man ; but being by his Prince , had they been ten , andthose ten drawn teeth , besides the hazard of his nose for ever ; all this had been but favours : this is my flat opinion , whichI'le die in .
The King may do much Captain , believe it ; for had he crackt yourScull through , like a bottle , or broke a Rib or two with tossingof you , yet you had lost no honour : This is strange you mayimagine , but this is truth now Captain .
I will be glad to embrace it Gentlemen ; But how far may he strike me ?
There is another : a new cause rising from the time and distance , in which I will deliver my opinion : he may strike , beat , or causeto be beaten : for these are natural to man : your Prince , I say , may beat you , so far forth as his dominion reacheth , that 's forthe distance ; the time , ten miles a day , I take it .
Brother , you err , 't is fifteen miles a day , His stage is ten , his beatings are fifteen .
'T is the longest , but we subjects must --
Be subject to it ; you are wise and vertuous .
Obedience ever makes that noble use o n't , To which I dedicate my beaten body ; I must trouble you a little further , Gentlemen o'th ' Sword .
No trouble at all to us Sir , if we mayProfit your understanding , we are boundBy vertue of our calling to utter our opinions , Shortly , and discreetly .
My sorest business is , I have been kick 'd .
How far Sir ?
Not to flatter my self in it , all over , my sword forc 'd but notlost ; for discreetly I rendred it to save that imputation .
It shew 'd discretion , the best part of valour .
Brother , this is a pretty cause , pray ponder o n't ; Our friend here has been kick 'd .
He has so , brother .
Sorely he saies : Now , had he set down hereUpon the meer kick , 't had been Cowardly .
I think it had been Cowardly indeed .
But our friend has redeem 'd it in deliveringHis sword without compulsion ; and that manThat took it of him , I pronounce a weak one , And his kicks nullities.He should have kick 'd him after the deliveringWhich is the confirmation of a Coward .
Brother , I take it , you mistake the question ; For , say that I were kick 'd .
I must not say so ; Nor I must not hear it spoke by the tongue of man.You kick 'd , dear brother ! you 're merry .
But put the case I were kick 'd ?
Let them put it that are things weary of their lives , and knownot honour ; put the case you were kick 'd ?
I do not say I was kickt .
Nor no silly creature that wears his head without a Case , hissoul in a Skin-coat : You kickt dear brother ?
Nay Gentlemen , let us do what we shall do , Truly and honest [ l ] y ; good Sirs to the question .
Why then I say , suppose your Boy kick't , Captain ?
The Boy may be suppos 'd is liable .
A foolish forward zeal Sir , in my friend ; But to the Boy , suppose the Boy were kickt .
I do suppose it .
Has your Boy a sword ?
Surely no ; I pray suppose a sword too .
I do suppose it ; you grant your Boy was kick't then .
By no means Captain , let it be supposed still ; the word grant , makes not for us .
I say this must be granted .
This must be granted brother ?
I , this must be granted .
Still this must ?
I say this must be granted .
I , give me the must again , brother , you palter .
I will not hear you , wasp .
Brother , I say you palter , the must three times together ; I wearas sharp Steel as another man , and my Fox bites as deep , musted , my dear brother. But to the cause again .
Nay look you Gentlemen .
In a word , I ha ' done .
A tall man but intemperate , 't is great pity ; Once more suppose the Boy kick 'd .
Forward .
And being thorowly kick 'd , laughs at the kicker .
So much for us ; proceed .
And in this beaten scorn , as I may call it , Delivers up his weapon ; where lies the error ?
It lies i'th ' beating Sir , I found it four dayes since .
The error , and a sore one as I take it , Lies in the thing kicking .
I understand that well , 't is so indeed Sir .
That is according to the man that did it .
There springs a new branch , whose was the foot ?
A Lords .
The cause is mighty , but had it been two Lords , And both had kick 'd you , if you laugh , 't is clear .
I did laugh , But how will that help me , Gentlemen ?
Yes , it shall help you if you laught aloud .
As loud as a kick 'd man could laugh , I laught Sir .
My reason now , the valiant man is knownBy suffering and contemning ; you haveEnough of both , and you are valiant .
If he be sure he has been kick 'd enough : For that brave sufferance you speak of brother , Consists not in a beating and away , But in a cudgell 'd body , from eighteenTo eight and thirty ; in a head rebuk'dWith pots of all size , degrees , stools , and bed-staves , This showes a valiant man .
Then I am valiant , as valiant as the proudest , For these are all familiar things to me ; Familiar as my sleep , or want of money , All my whole body 's but one bruise with beating , I think I have been cudgell 'd with all nations , And almost all Religions .
Embrace him brother , this man is valiant , I know it by my self , he 's valiant .
Captain , thou art a valiant Gentleman , To bide upon , a very valiant man .
My equall friends o'th'Sword , I must request your hands to this .
'T is fit it should be .
Boy , get me some wine , and pen and Ink within : Am I clear , Gentlemen ?
Sir , the world has taken notice what we have done , Make much of your body , for I 'll pawn my steel , Men will be coyer of their legs hereafter .
I must request you goe along and testife to the Lord Bacurius , whose foot has struck me , how you find my cause .
We will , and tell that Lord he must be rul 'd , Or there are those abroad , will rule his Lordship. [ Exeunt .

Sir , here 's the Princess .
Leave us then alone , For the main cause of her imprisonmentMust not be heard by any but her self. [ Exit Gob.You 're welcome Sister , and would to heavenI could so bid you by another name : If you above love not such sins as these , Circle my heart with thoughts as cold as snowTo quench these rising flames that harbour here .
Sir , does it please you I should speak ?
Please me ? I , more than all the art of musick can , Thy speech doth please me , for it ever sounds , As thou brought'st joyfull unexpected news ; And yet it is not fit thou shouldst be heard.I pray thee think so .
Be it so , I will.Am I the first that ever had a wrongSo far from being fit to have redress , That 't was unfit to hear it ? I will backTo prison , rather than disquiet you , And wait till it be fit .
No , do not goe ; For I will hear thee with a serious thought : I have collected all that 's man about meTogether strongly , and I am resolv'dTo hear thee largely , but I do beseech thee , Do not come nearer to me , for there isSomething in that , that will undoe us both .
Alas Sir , am I venome ?
Yes , to me ; Though of thy self I think thee to beIn equall degree of heat or cold , As nature can make : yet as unsound menConvert the sweetest and the nourishing'st meatsInto diseases ; so shall I distemper 'd , Do thee , I pray thee draw no nearer to me .
Sir , this is that I would : I am of lateShut from the world , and why it should be thus , Is all I wish to know .
Why credit me Panthea , Credit me that am thy brother , Thy loving brother , that there is a causeSufficient , yet unfit for thee to know , That might undoe thee everlastingly , Only to hear , wilt thou but credit this ? By Heaven 't is true , believe it if thou canst .
Children and fools are ever credulous , And I am both , I think , for I believe ; If you dissemble , be it on your head ; I'le back unto my prison : yet me-thinksI might be kept in some place where you are ; For in my self , I find I know not whatTo call it , but it is a great desireTo see you often .
Fie , you come in a step , what do you mean ? Dear sister , do not so : Alas Panthea , Where I am would you be ? Why that 's the causeYou are imprison 'd , that you may not beWhere I am .
Then I must indure it Sir , Heaven keep you .
Nay , you shall hear the case in short Panthea , And when thou hear'st it , thou wilt blush for me , And hang thy head down like a VioletFull of the mornings dew : There is a wayTo gain thy freedome , but 't is such a oneAs puts thee in worse bondage , and I know , Thou wouldst encounter fire , and make a proofWhether the gods have care of innocence , Rather than follow it : Know that I have lost , The only difference betwixt man and beast , My reason .
Heaven forbid .
Nay 't is gone ; And I am left as far without a bound , As the wild Ocean , that obeys the winds ; Each sodain passion throwes me where it lists , And overwhelms all that oppose my will : I have beheld thee with a lustfull eye ; My heart is set on wickedness to actSuch sins with thee , as I have been afraidTo think of , if thou dar'st consent to this , Which I beseech thee do not , thou maist gainThy liberty , and yield me a content ; If not , thy dwelling must be dark and close , Where I may never see thee ; For heaven knowsThat laid this punishment upon my pride , Thy sight at some time will enforce my madnessTo make a start e'ne to thy ravishing ; Now spit upon me , and call all reproachesThou canst devise together , and at onceHurle'em against me : for I am a sicknessAs killing as the plague , ready to seize thee .
Far be it from me to revile the King : But it is true , that I shall rather chooseTo search out death , that else would search out me , And in a grave sleep with my innocence , Than welcome such a sin : It is my fate , To these cross accidents I was ordain 'd , And must have patience ; and but that my eyesHave more of woman in 'em than my heart , I would not weep : Peace enter you again .
Farwell , and good Panthea pray for me , Thy prayers are pure , that I may find a deathHowever soon before my passions growThat they forget what I desire is sin ; For thither they are tending : if that happen , Then I shall force thee tho ' thou wert a VirginBy vow to Heaven , and shall pull a heapOf strange yet uninvented sin upon me .
Sir , I will pray for you , yet you shall knowIt is a sullen fate that governs us , For I could wish as heartily as youI were no sister to you , I should thenImbrace your lawfull love , sooner than health .
Couldst thou affect me then ?
So perfectly , That as it is , I ne 're shall sway my heart , To like another .
Then I curse my birth , Must this be added to my miseriesThat thou art willing too ? is there no stopTo our full happiness , but these meer soundsBrother and Sister ?
There is nothing else , But these alas will separate us moreThan twenty worlds betwixt us .
I have liv'dTo conquer men and now am overthrownOnly by words Brother and Sister : whereHave those words dwelling ? I will find 'em out , And utterly destroy 'em ; but they areNot to be grasp 'd : let 'em be men or beasts , And I will cut 'em from the Earth , or Towns , And I will raze 'em , and the [ n ] blow 'em up : Let 'em be Seas , and I will drink 'em off , And yet have unquencht fire left in my breast : Let 'em be any thing but meerly voice .
But 't is not in the power of any force , Or policy to conquer them .
, What shall we do ? Shall we stand firmly here , and gaze our eyes out ?
Would I could do so , But I shall weep out mine .
Accursed man , Thou bought'st thy reason at too dear a rate , For thou hast all thy actions bounded inWith curious rules , when every beast is free : What is there that acknowledges a kindredBut wretched man ? Who ever saw the BullFearfully leave the Heifer that he lik'dBecause they had one Dam ?
Sir , I disturb you and my self too ; 'Twere better I were gone .
I will not be so foolish as I was , Stay , we will love just as becomes our births , No otherwise : Brothers and Sisters mayWalk hand in hand together ; so will we , Come nearer : is there any hurt in this ?
I hope not .
Faith there is none at all : And tell me truly now , is there not oneYou love above me ?
No by Heaven .
Why yet you sent unto Tigranes , Sister .
True , but for another : for the truth --
No more , I'le credit thee , thou canst not lie , Thou art all truth .
But is there nothing else , That we may do , but only walk ? methinksBrothers and Sisters lawfully may kiss .
And so they may Panthea , so will we , And kiss again too ; we were too scrupulous , And foolish , but we will be so no more .
If you have any mercy , let me goTo prison , to my death , to any thing : I feel a sin growing upon my blood , Worse than all these , hotter than yours .
That is impossible , what shou 'd we do ?
Flie Sir , for Heavens sake .
So we must away , Sin grows upon us more by this delay. [ Exeunt several wayes .
Mardonius And Lygones .
Sir , the King has seen your Commission , and believes it , andfreely by this warrant gives you power to visit Prince Tigranes , your Noble Master .
I thank his Grace and kiss his hand .
But is the main of all your business ended in this ?
I have another , but a worse , I am asham 'd , it is a business .
You serve a worthy person , and a stranger I am sure you are ; youmay imploy me if you please without your purse , such Officesshould ever be their own rewards .
I am bound to your Nobleness .
I may have need of you , and then this courtesie , If it be any , is not ill bestowed ; But may I civilly desire the rest ? I shall not be a hurter if no helper .
Sir you shall know I have lost a foolish Daughter , And with her all my patience , pilfer 'd awayBy a mean Captain of your Kings .
Stay there Sir : If he have reacht the Noble worth of Captain , He may well claim a worthy Gentlewoman , Though she were yours , and Noble .
I grant all that too : but this wretched fellowReaches no further than the empty nameThat serves to feed him ; were he valiant , Or had but in him any noble natureThat might hereafter promise him a good man , My cares were so much lighter , and my graveA span yet from me .
I confess such fellowsBe in all Royal Camps , and have and must be , To make the sin of Coward more detestedIn the mean souldier that with such a foilSets off much valour. By descriptionI should now guess him to you , it was Bessus , I dare almost with confidence pronounce it .
'T is such a scurvie name as Bessus , and now I think 't is he .
Captain do you call him ? Believe me Sir , you have a miseryToo mighty for your age : A pox upon him , For that must be the end of all his service : Your Daughter was not mad Sir ?
No , would she had been , The fault had had more credit : I would do something .
I would fain counsel you , but to what I know not , he 's so below abeating , that the Women find him not worthy of their Distaves , and to hang him were to cast away a Rope ; he 's such an Airie , thin unbodyed Coward , that no revenge can catch him : I'le tellyou Sir , and tell you truth ; this Rascal fears neither God norman , he has been so beaten : sufferance has made him Wainscot : hehas had since he was first a slave , at least three hundredDaggers set in 's head , as little boys do new Knives in hot meat , there 's not a Rib in 's body o ' my Conscience that has not beenthrice broken with dry beating : and now his sides look like twoWicker Targets , every way bended ; Children will shortly take himfor a Wall , and set their Stone-bows in his forehead , he is of sobase a sense , I can not in a week imagine what shall be done tohim .
Sure I have committed some great sinThat this fellow should be made my Rod , I would see him , but I shall have no patience .
'T is no great matter if you have not : if a Laming of him , orsuch a toy may do you pleasure Sir , he has it for you , and I'lehelp you to him : 't is no news to him to have a Leg broken , orShoulder out , with being turn 'd o'th ' stones like a Tansie : drawnot your Sword if you love it ; for on my Conscience his head willbreak it : we use him i'th ' Wars like a Ram to shake a wallwithal. Here comes the very person of him , do as you shall findyour temper , I must leave you : but if you do not break him like aBisket , you are much to blame Sir. [ Exit Mar .
Bessus And the Sword men .
Is your name Bessus ?
Men call me Captain Bessus .
Then Ca [ p ] tain Bessus , you are a rank rascall , without moreexordiums , a durty frozen slave ; and with the favor of yourfriends here I will beat you .
Pray use your pleasure Sir , You seem to be a Gentleman .
Thus Captain Bessus , thus ; thus twing your nose , thus kick , thus tread you .
I do beseech you yield your cause Sir quickly .
Indeed I should have told that first .
I take it so .
Captain , he should indeed , he is mistaken .
Sir , you shall have it quickly , and more beating , you have stoln away a Lady , Captain coward , and such anone .
Hold , I beseech you , hold Sir , I never yet stole any living thingthat had a tooth about it .
I know you dare lie .
With none but Summer Whores upon my life Sir , my means andmanners never could attempt above a hedge or hay-cock .
Sirra , that quits not me , where is this Lady ? do that you do notuse to do ; tell truth , or by my hand , I'le beat your Captainsbrains out , wash'em , and put 'em in again , that will I .
There was a Lady Sir , I must confess , once in my charge : thePrince Tigranes gave her to my guard for her safety , how I us'dher , she may her self report , she 's with the Prince now : I didbut wait upon her like a groom , which she will testife I am sure : if not , my brains are at your service when you please Sir , andglad I have 'em for you .
This is most likely , Sir , I ask you pardon , and am sorry I was sointemperate .
Well I can ask no more , you will think it strange not to have mebeat you at first sight .
Indeed I would , but I know your goodness can forget twentybeatings , you must forgive me .
Yes there 's my hand , go where you will , I shall think you avaliant fellow for all this .
My da [ u ] ghter is a Whore , I feel it now too sensible ; yet I willsee her , discharge my self from being father to her , and thenback to my Country , and there die , farwell Captain. [ Exit Lygo .
Farwell Sir , farwell , commend me to the gentlewoman I pray .
How now Captain ? bear up man .
Gentlemen o'th'sword , your hands once more ; I have been kicktagen , but the foolish fellow is penitent , has askt me Mercy , andmy honour 's safe .
We knew that , or the foolish fellow had better have kickt hisgrandsir .
Confirm , confirm I pray .
There be our hands agen , now let him come and say he was notsorry , and he sleeps for it .
Alas good ignorant old man , let him go , let him go , these courseswill undo him. [ Exeunt clear .
Lygones And Bacurius .
My Lord , your authority is good , and I am glad it is so , for myconsent would never hinder you from seeing your own King , I am aMinister , but not a governor of this State , yonder is your King , I'le leave you. [ Exit .
Tigranes And Spaconia .
There he is indeed , and with him my disloyal child .
I do perceive my fault so much , that yet me thinks thou shouldstnot have forgiven me .
Health to your Majesty .
What ? good Lygones welcome , what business brought thee hither ?
Several businesses. My publick businesses will appear by this , Ihave a message to deliver , which if it please you so toauthorize , is an embassage from the Armenian State , unto Arbacesfor your liberty : the offer 's there set down , please you to readit .
There is no alteration happened since I came thence ?
None Sir , all is as it was .
And all our friends are well ?
All very well .
Though I have done nothing but what was good , I dare not see myFather , it was fault enough not to acquaint him with that good .
Madam I should have seen you .
O good Sir forgive me .
Forgive you , why ? I am no kin to you , am I ?
Should it be measur 'd by my mean deserts , indeed you are not .
Thou couldest prate unhappily ere thou couldst go , would thoucouldst do as well , and how does your custome hold out here ?
Sir ?
Are you in private still , or how ?
What do you mean ?
Do you take mony ? are you come to sell sin yet ? perhaps I canhelp you to liberal Clients : or has not the King cast you offyet ? O thou vile creature , whose best commendation is , that thouart a young whore , I would thy Mother had liv 'd to see this , orrather that I had died ere I had seen it ; why didst not make meacquainted when thou wert first resolv 'd to be a whore , I wouldhave seen thy hot lust satisfied more privately : I would havekept a dancer and a whole consort of musicians in my own houseonly to fiddle thee .
Sir , I was never whore .
If thou couldst not say so much for thy self , thou shouldst becarted .
, I have read it , and I like it , you shall deliver it .
Well Sir , I will : but I have private business with you .
Speak , what is't ?
How has my age deserv 'd so ill of you , that you canpick no strumpets i'th ' land , but out of my breed ?
Strumpets , good Lygones ?
Yes , and I wish to have you know , I scorn to get a whore for anyprince alive , and yet scorn will not help methinks : my Daughtermight have been spar 'd , there were enow besides .
May I not prosper but she 's innocent as morning light for me , andI dare swear for all the world .
Why is she with you then ? can she wait on you better than yourman , has she a gift in plucking off your stockings , can she makeCawdles well or cut your cornes ? Why do you keep her with you ? For a Queen I know you do contemn her , so should I , and everysubject else think much at it .
Let 'em think much , but 't is more firm than earth : thou see'stthy Queen there .
Then have I made a fair hand , I call 'd her Whore. If I shallspeak now as her Father , I can not chuse but greatly rejoyce thatshe shall be a Queen : but if I shall speak to you as aStates-man , she were more fit to be your whore .
Get you about your business to Arbaces , now you talk idlely .
Yes Sir , I will go , and shall she be a Queen ? she had more witthan her old Father , when she ran away : shall she be Queen ? nowby my troth 't is fine , I'le dance out of all measure at her
Yes marry shalt thou .
I'le make these withered kexes bear my body two hours togetherabove ground .
Nay go , my business requires hast .
Good Heaven preserve you , you are an excellent King .
Farwell good Father .
Farwell sweet vertuous Daughter , I never was so joyfull in all mylife , that I remember : shall she be a Queen ? Now I perceive a manmay weep for joy , I had thought they had lyed that said so. [ Exit Lygones .
Come my dear love .
But you may see another may alter that again .
Urge it no more , I have made up a new strong constancy , not to beshook with eyes : I know I have the passions of a man , but if Imeet with any subject that should hold my eyes more firmly thanis fit , I'le think of thee , and run away from it : let thatsuffice. [ Exeunt all .
Bacurius And his Servant .
Three Gentlemen without to speak with me ?
Yes Sir .
Let them come in .
Bessus with the two Sword-men .
They are entred Sir already .
Now fellows your business ? are these the Gentlemen ?
My Lord , I have made bold to bring these Gentlemen , my friendso'th ' Sword along with me .
I am afraid you'l fight then .
My good Lord , I will not , your Lordship is much mistaken , fearnot Lord .
Sir , I am sorry for't .
I ask no more in honour , Gentlemen you hear my Lord is sorry .
Not that I have beaten you , but beaten one that will be beaten : one whose dull body will require a laming , as Surfeits do thediet , spring and fall ; now to your Sword-men ; what come they for , good Captain Stock-fish ?
It seems your Lordship has forgot my name .
No , nor your nature neither , though they are things fitter I mustconfess for any thing , than my remembrance , or any honest mans : what shall these Billets do ; be pil 'd up in my wood-yard ?
Your Lordship holds your mirth still , Heaven continue it : but forthese Gentlemen , they come --
To swear you are a Coward , spare your book , I do believe it .
Your Lordship still draws wide , they come to vouch under theirvaliant hands I am no Coward .
That would be a show indeed worth seeing : sirra be wise , and takeMony for this motion , travel with it , and where the name of
has been known or a good Coward stirring , 'twill yieldmore than a tilting. This will prove more beneficial to you , ifyou be thrifty , than your Captainship , and more natural : men ofmost valiant hands is this true ?
It is so , most renowned .
'T is somewhat strange .
Lord , it is strange , yet true ; we have examined from yourLordships foot there , to this mans head , the nature of thebeatings ; and we do find his honour is come off clean and
You are much bound to your Bil-bow-men , I am glad you arestraight again Captain ; 'twere good you would think on some wayto gratifie them , they have undergone a labour for you , Bessuswould have puzl 'd hercules with all his valour .
Your Lordship must understand we are no men o'th ' Law , that takepay for our opinions : it is sufficient we have clear 'd ourfriend .
Yet there is something due , which I as toucht in Conscience willdischarge Captain ; I'le pay this Rent for you .
Spare your self my good Lord ; my brave friends aim at nothing butthe vertue .
That 's but a cold discharge Sir for the pains .
O Lord , my good Lord .
Be not so modest , I will give you something .
They shall dine with your Lordship , that 's sufficient .
Something in hand the while , you Rogues , you Apple-squires : doyou come hither with your botled valour , your windy froth , tolimit out my beatings ?
I do beseech your Lordship .
O good Lord .
S'foot-what a heavy of beaten slaves are here ! get me a Cudgelsirra , and a tough one .
More of your foot , I do beseech your Lordship .
You shall , you shall dog , and your fellow-beagle .
O ' this side good my Lord .
Off with your swords , for if you hurt my foot , I'le have youflead you Rascals .
Mine 's off my Lord .
I beseech your Lordship stay a little , my strap 's tied to my Codpiece-point : now when you please .
Captain these are your valiant friends , you long for a littletoo ?
I am very well , I humbly thank your Lordship .
What 's that in your pocket , hurts my Toe you Mungril ? ThyButtocks can not be so hard , out with it quickly .
Here 't is Sir , a small piece of Artillery , that a Gentleman adear friend of your Lordships sent me with , to get it mended Sir , for if you mark , the nose is somewhat loose .
A friend of mine you Rascal ? I was never wearier of doing anything , than kicking these two Foot-balls .
Servant .
Here is a good Cudgel Sir .
It comes too late I'me weary , pray thee do thou beat them .
My Lord , this is foul play i'faith , to put a fresh man upon us , men are but men Sir .
That jest shall save your bones ; Captain , Rally up your rottenRegiment and be gone : I had rather thrash than be bound to kickthese Rascals , till they cry 'd ho ; Bessus you may put your handto them now , and then you are quit. Farewel , as you like this , pray visit me again , 'twill keep me in good health. [ Exit Bac .
H'as a devilish hard foot , I never felt the like .
Nor I , and yet I am sure I have felt a hundred .
If he kick thus i'th ' Dog-daies , he will be dry foundred : whatcure now Captain besides Oyl of Baies ?
Why well enough I warrant you , you can go .
Yes , heaven be thanked ; but I feel a shrowd ach , sure h'as sprangmy huckle-bone .
I ha ' lost a hanch .
A little butter , friend a little butter , butter and parseley anda soveraign matter : probatum est .
Captain we must request your hand now to our honours .
Yes marry shall ye , and then let all the world come , we arevaliant to our selves , and there 's an end .
Nay then we must be valiant ; O my ribs .
O my small guts , a plague upon these sharp-toed shooes , they aremurtherers. [ Exeunt clear .
Arbaces with his sword drawn .
It is resolv 'd , I bare it whilst I could , I can no more , I mustbegin with murther of my friends , and so go on to that incestuousravishing , and end my life and sins with a forbidden blow , uponmy self .
Mardonius .
What Tragedy is near ? That hand was never wont to draw a sword , but it cry 'd dead to something .
, have you bid Gobrias come ?
How do you Sir ?
Well , is he coming ?
Why Sir , are you thus ? why do your hands proclaim a lawless Waragainst your self ?
Thou answerest me one question with an other , is Gobriascoming ?
Sir he is .
'T is well , I can forbear your questions then , be gone .
Sir , I have mark't .
Mark less , it troubles you and me .
You are more variable than you were .
It may be so .
To day no Hermit could be humbler than you were to us all .
And what of this ?
And now you take new rage into your eyes , as you would look usall out of the Land .
I do confess it , will that satisfie ? I prethee get thee gone .
Sir , I will speak .
Will ye ?
It is my duty. I fear you will kill your self : I am a subject , and you shall do me wrong i n't : 't is my cause , and I may speak .
Thou art not train 'd in sin , it seems Mardonius : kill my self ! by Heaven I will not do it yet ; and when I will , I'le tell thee
without a word. There is a method in mans wickedness , it grows upby degrees : I am not come so high as killing of my self , thereare a hundred thousand sins 'twixt me and it , which I must doe , and I shall come to't at last ; but take my oath not now , besatisfied , and get thee hence .
I am sorry 't is so ill .
Be sorry then , true sorrow is alone , grieve by thyself .
I pray you let me see your Sword put up before I go : I'le leaveyou then .
Why so ? what folly is this in thee , is it not as apt to mischiefas it was before ? can I not reach it thinkst thou ? these aretoyes for Children to be pleas 'd with , and not men , now I am safeyou think : I would the book of fate were here , my Sword is not sosure but I would get it out and mangle that , that all thedestinies should quite forget their fixt decrees , and hast tomake us new , for other fortunes , mine could not be worse , wiltthou now leave me ?
Heaven put into your bosome temperate thoughts , I'le leave youthough I fear .
Go , thou art honest , why should the hasty error of my youth be sounpardonable to draw a sin helpless upon me ?
Gobrias .
There is the King , now it is ripe .
Draw near thou guilty man , that art the authour of the loathedstcrime five ages have brought forth , and hear me speak ; cursesmore incurable , and all the evils mans body or his Spirit canreceive be with thee .
Why Sir do you curse me thus ?
Why do I curse thee ? if there be a man subtil in curses , thatexceeds the rest , his worst wish on thee , thou hast broke myheart .
How Sir , have I preserv 'd you from a child , from all the arrows , malice , or ambition could shoot at you , and have I this for mypay ?
'T is true , thou didst preserve me , and in that wert crueller thanhardned murtherers of infants and their Mothers ! thou didst saveme only till thou hadst studied out a way how to destroy mecunningly thy self : this was a curious way of torturing .
What do you mean ?
Thou knowst the evils thou hast done to me ; dost thou rememberall those witching letters thou sent'st unto me to Armenia , fill 'd with the praise of my beloved Sister , where thou extol'sther beauty , what had I to do with that ? what could her beauty beto me ? and thou didst write how well she lov 'd me , dost thouremember this ? so that I doted something before I saw her .
This is true .
Is it ? and when I was return 'd thou knowst thou didst pursue it , till thou woundst me into such a strange and unbeliev'daffection , as good men can not think on .
This I grant , I think I was the cause .
Wert thou ? Nay more , I think thou meant'st it .
Sir , I hate to lie , as I love Heaven and honesty , I did , it wasmy meaning .
Be thine own sad judge , a further condemnation will not need , prepare thy self to dy .
Why Sir to dy ?
Why shouldst thou live ? was ever yet offender so impudent , thathad a thought of Mercy after confession of a crime like this ? getout I can not where thou hurl'st me in , but I can take revenge , that 's all the sweetness left for me .
Now is the time , hear me but speak .
No , yet I will be far more mercifull than thou wert to me ; thoudidst steal into me and never gav'st me warning : so much time asI give thee now , had prevented thee for ever. Notwithstanding allthy sins , if thou hast hope , that there is yet a prayer to savethee , turn and speak it to thy self .
Sir , you shall know your sins before you do'em , if you kill me .
I will not stay then .
Know you kill your Father .
How ?
You kill your Father .
My Father ? though I know't for a lie , made out of fear to savethy stained life ; the very reverence of the word comes cross me , and ties mine arm down .
I will tell you that shall heighten you again , I am thy Father , Icharge thee hear me .
If it should be so , as 't is most false , and that I should befound a Bastard issue , the despised fruit of lawless lust , Ishould no more admire all my wild passions : but another truthshall be wrung from thee : if I could come by the Spirit of pain , it should be poured on thee , till thou allow'st thy self morefull of lies than he that teaches thee .
Arane .
Turn thee about , I come to speak to thee thou wicked man , hear methou tyrant .
I will turn to thee , hear me thou Strumpet ; I have blotted outthe name of Mother , as thou hast thy shame .
My shame ! thou hast less shame than any thing ; why dost thou keepmy Daughter in a prison ? why dost thou call her Sister , and dothis ?
Cease thy strange impudence , and answer quickly if thoucontemnest me , this will ask an answer , and have it .
Help me Gentle Gobrias .
Guilt [ dare ] not help guilt though they grow together in doingill , yet at the [ punishment ] they sever , and each flies the noiseof other , think not of help , answer .
I will , to what ?
To such a thing , as if it be a truth think what a creature thouhast made thy self , that didst not shame to do , what I must blushonly to ask thee : tell me who I am , whose son I am without allcircumstance , be thou as hasty as my Sword will be if thourefusest .
Why , you are his son .
His Son ? swear , swear , thou worse than woman damn 'd .
By all that 's good you are .
Then art thou all that ever was known bad , now is the cause ofall my strange mis-fortunes come to light : what reverenceexpectest thou from a child , to bring forth which thou hastoffended heaven , thy husband , and the Land ? adulterous witch , Iknow now why thou wouldst have poyson 'd me , I was thy lust whichthou wouldst have forgot : then wicked Mother of my sins , and me , show me the way to the inheritance I have by thee : which is aspacious world of impious acts , that I may soon possess it : plagues rot thee , as thou liv'st , and such diseases , as use topay lust , recompence thy deed .
You do not know why you curse thus .
Too well ; you are a pair of Vipers ; and behold the Serpent youhave got ; there is no beast but if he knew it , has a pedigree asbrave as mine , for they have more descents , and I am every way asbeastly got , as far without the compass of Law as they .
You spend your rage and words in vain , and rail upon a guess ; hear us a little .
No , I will never hear , but talk away my breath , and die .
Why , but you are no Bastard .
How 's that ?
Nor child of mine .
Still you go on in wonders to me .
Pray you be more patient , I may bring comfort to you .
I will kneel , and hear with the obedience of a child ; good Fatherspeak , I do acknowledge you , so you bring comfort .
First know , our last King , your supposed Father was old andfeeble when he married her , and almost all the Land thought shewas past hope of issue from him .
Therefore she took leave to play the whore , because the King was
What will you find out to give me satisfaction , when you find howyou have injur 'd me ? let fire consume me , if ever I were a whore .
For-bear these starts , or I will leave you wedded to despair , asyou are now : if you can find a temper , my breath shall be apleasant western wind that cools and blasts not .
Bring it out good Father. I'le lie , and listen here as reverentlyas to an Angel : if I breath too loud , tell me ; for I would be asstill as night .
Our King I say , was old , and this our Queen desir 'd to bring anheir , but yet her husband she thought was past it , and to bedishonest I think she would not : if she would have been , thetruth is , she was watcht so narrowly , and had so slenderopportunities , she hardly could have been : but yet her cunningfound out this way ; she feign 'd her self with child , and postswere sent in hast throughout the Land , and humble thanks wasgiven in every Church , and prayers were made for her safe goingand delivery : she feign 'd now to grow bigger , and perceiv 'd thishope of issue made her fear 'd , and brought a far more largerespect from every man , and saw her power increase , and wasresolv 'd , since she believ 'd , she could not hav't indeed , atleast she would be thought to have a child .
Do I not hear it well ? nay I will make no noise at all ; but prayyou to the point , quickly as you can .
And have you made an end now ? is this all ? if not , I will be still till I be aged , till all my hairs be Silver .
This is all .
And is it true say you too Madam ?
Yes heaven knows it is most true .
then is not my Sister ?
No .
But can you prove this ?
If you will give consent , else who dares go about it ?
Give consent ? why I will have 'em all that know it rackt , to getthis from 'em , all that wait without , come in , what ere you be , come in and be partakers of my joy , O you are welcome .
Bessus , Gentlemen , Mardonius , And other attendants .
The best news , nay draw no nearer , they all shall hear it , I amfound no King .
Is that so good news ?
Yes the happiest news that ere was heard .
Indeed 'twere well for you if you might be a little less obey 'd .
One call the Queen .
Why she is there .
The Queen Mardonius , Panthea is the Queen and I am plain

So it should seem my Lord , what fury 's this ?
Believe me 't is no fury , all that he saies is truth .
'T is very strange .
Why do you keep your hats off Gentlemen ? is it to me ? I swear itmust not be ; nay , trust me , in good faith it must not be ; Icannot now command you , but I pray you for the respect you bareme , when you took me for your King , each man clap on his hat atmy desire .
We will , you are not found so mean a man , but that you may becover 'd as well as we , may you not ?
O not here , you may , but not I , for here is my Father inpresence .
Where ?
Why there : O the whole story would be a wilderness to lose thyself for ever : O pardon me dear Father for all the idle andunreverent words that I have spoke in idle moods to you : I am
, we all fellow-subjects , nor is the Queen Panthea nowmy Sister .
Why if you remember fellow-subject Arbaces ; I told you onceshe was not your sister : I , and she lookt nothing like you .
I think you did , good Captain Bessus .
Here will arise another question now amongst the Sword-men , whether I be to call him to account for beating me , now he isproved no King .
Lygones .
Sir here 's Lygones , the agent for the Armenian State .
Where is he ? I know your business good Lygones .
We must have our King again , and will .
I knew that was your business : you shall have your King again , and have him so again as never King was had , go one of you andbid Bacurius bring Tigranes hither ; and bring the Lady withhim , that Panthea , the Queen Panthea sent me word this [ morning ] , was brave Tigranes mistress. [ Ex. two Gent .
'T is Spaconia .
I , I , Spaconia .
She is my Daughter .
She is so : I could now tell any thing I never heard : your Kingshall go so home , as never man went .
Shall he go on 's head ?
He shall have chariots easier than air that I will have invented ; and ne 're think one shall pay any ransome , and thy self that artthe messenger , shalt ride before him on a horse cut out of anintire Diamond , that shall be made to go with golden wheeles , Iknow not how yet .
Why I shall be made for ever ? they beli 'd this King with us , andsaid he was unkind .
And then thy Daughter , she shall have some strange thing , wee'lhave the Kingdom sold utterly , and put into a toy which she shallwear about her carelesly some where or other. See the vertuousQueen ; behold the humblest subject that you have kneel herebefore you .
Panthea And 1 Gent .
Why kneel you to me that am your Vassal ?
Grant me one request .
Alas what can I grant you ? what I can , I will .
That you will please to marry me if I can prove it lawfull .
Is that all ? more willingly than I would draw this air .
I'le kiss this hand in earnest .
Sir , Tigranes is coming though he made it strange at first , tosee the Princess any more .
Tigranes And Spaconia .
The Queen thou meanest , O my Tigranes. Pardon me , tread on myneck , I freely offer it , and if thou beest so given take revenge , for I have injur 'd thee .
No , I forgive , and rejoyce more that you have found repentance , than I my liberty .
Mayest thou be happy in thy fair choice , for thou art temperate.You owe no ransom to the state , know that I have a thousand joyesto tell you of , which yet I dare not utter till I pay my thanksto Heaven for 'em : Will you go with me and help me ? pray you do .
I will .

Sir , the King has seene your Commission , and beleeves it , andfreely by this warrant gives you leave to visit Prince
your noble Master .
I thanke his Grace , and kisse his hands .
But is the maine of all your businesseEnded in this ?
I have another , but a worse ; I am asham 'd , it is a businesse. --
You serve a worthy person , and a stranger I am sure you are ; youmay imploy mee if you please , without your purse , such Officersshould ever be their owne rewards .
I am bound to your noblenesse .
I may have neede of you , and then this curtesie , If it be any , is not ill bestowed : But may I civilly desire the rest ? I shall not be a hurter , if no helper .
Sir , you shall know I have lost a foolish daughter , And with her all my patience ; pilferd awayBy a meane Captaine of your Kings .
Stay there Sir : If he have reacht the noble worth of Captaine , He may well claime a worthy gentlewoman , Though shee were yours , and noble .
I grant all that too : but this wretched fellowReaches no further then the emptie name , That serves to feede him ; were he valiant , Or had but in him any noble nature , That might hereafter promise him a good man ; My cares were something lighter , and my graveA span yet from me .
I confesse such fellowesBe in all royall Campes , and have , and must beTo make the sinne of coward more detestedIn the meane Souldier , that with such a foyleSets of much valour : By descriptionI should now guesse him to you. It was Bessus , I dare almost with confidence pronounce it .
Tis such a scurvy name as Bessus , and now I thinke tis hee .
Captaine , doe you call him ? Beleeve me Sir , you have a miserieToo mighty for your age : A pox upon him , For that must be the end of all his service : Your daughter was not mad Sir ?
No , would shee had beene , The fault had had more credit : I would doe something .
I would faine counsell you ; but to what I know not : Hee 's so below a beating , that the womenFind him not worthy of their distaves ; andTo hang him , were to cast away a rope , Hee 's such an ayrie thin unbodied coward , That no revenge can catch him : He tell you Sir , and tell you truth ; this rascallFeares neither God nor man , has beene so beaten : Sufferance has made him wanscote ; he has hadSince hee was first a slave , at least three hundred daggersSet in his head , as little boyes doe new knives in hot meat ; Ther 's not a rib in 's bodie a my conscience , That has not beene thrice broken with drie beating ; And now his sides looke like to wicker targets , Everie way bended : Children will shortly take him for a wall , And set their stone-bowes in his forhead : is of so low a sence , I can not in a weeke imagine what should be done to him .
Sure I have committed some great sinne , That this strange fellow should be made my rod : I would see him , but I shall have no patience:
Tis no great matter if you have not , if a laming of him , or sucha toy may doe you pleasure Sir , he has it for you , and Ile helpeyou to him : tis no newes to him to have a leg broke , or ashoulder out , with being turnd ath ' stones like a Tanzie : Drawnot your sword , if you love it ; for my conscience his head willbreake it : we use him ith ' warres like a Ramme to shake a wallwithall ; here comes the verie person of him , doe as you shallfind your temper I must leave you : but if you doe not breake himlike a bisket , you are much too blame Sir. Ex. Mardo. EnterBessus and Sword-men .
Is your name Bessus ?
Men call me Captaine Bessus .
Then Captaine Bessus you are a ranke rascall , without moreexordiums , a durty frozen slave ; and with the favour of yourfriends here , I will beate you .
Pray use your pleasure Sir , you seem to be a gentleman .
Thus Captaine Bessus , thus ; thus twinge your nose , thus kickeyou , and thus tread you .
I doe beseech you yeeld your cause Sir quickly .
Indeed I should have told you that first .
I take it so .
Captaine , a should indeed , he is mistaken:
Sir you shall have it quickly , and more beating , You have stolne away a Lady Captaine Coward , And such a one .
Hold , I beseech you , hold Sir , I never yet stole any living thingThat had a tooth about it .
Sir I know you dare lieWith none but Summer Whores upon my life Sir .
My meanes and manners never could attemptAbove a hedge or hey-cocke .
Sirra that quits not me , where is this Ladie , Doe that you doe not use to doe , tell truth , Or by my hand Ile beat your Captaines braines out.Wash um , and put um in againe , that will I .
There was a Ladie Sir , I must confesseOnce in my charge : the Prince Tigranes gave herTo my guard for her safetie , how I usd herShe may her selfe report , shee 's with the Prince now : I did but waite upon her like a Groome , Which she will testifie I am sure : If not , My braines are at your service when you please Sir , And glad I have um for you ?
This is most likely , Sir I aske your pardon , And am sorrie I was so intemperate .
Well , I can aske no more , you would thinke it strange Now to haveme beat you at first sight .
Indeed I would but I know your goodnes can forgetTwentie beatings. You must forgive me .
Yes , ther 's my hand , goe where you will , I shall thinkeYou a valiant fellow for all this .
My daughter is a Whore , I feele it now too sencible ; yet I will see her , Discharge my selfe of being Father to her , And then backe to my Countrie , and there die ; Farewell Captaine .
Farewell Sir , farewell , commend me to the Gentlewoman I praia .
How now Captaine , beare up man .
Gentlemen ath ' sword your hands once more , I haveBeene kickt againe , but the foolish fellow is penitent , Has ask't me mercy , and my honor 's safe .
We knew that , or the foolish fellow had better a kick'tHis Grandsire.Confirme , confirme I pray .
There be our hands againe .
Now let him come , and say he was not sorry , And he sleepes for it .
Alas good ignorant old man , let him goe , Let him goe , these courses will undoe him .
My Lord your authoritie is good , and I am glad it is so , for myconsent would never hinder you from seeing your owne King. I am aMinister , but not a governour of this state ; yonder is your King , Ile leave you .
There he is indeed , Enter Tig. and Spaco.And with him my disloyall childe .
I doe perceive my fault so much , that yetMe thinkes thou shouldst not have forgiven me .
Health to your Maiestie .
What ? good Ligones , welcome ; what businesse brought thee hether ?
Severall Businesses.My publique businesse will appeare by this : I have a message to deliver , whichIf it please you so to authorise , isAn embassage from the Armenian state , Unto Arbaces for your libertie : The offer 's there set downe , please you to read it .
There is no alteration happenedSince I came thence ?
None Sir , all is as it was .
And all our friends are well .
All verie well .
Though I have done nothing but what was good , I dare not see my Father : it was faultEnough not to acquaint him with that good .
Madam I should have scene you .
O good Sir forgive me .
Forgive you , why I am no kin to you , am I ?
Should it be measur 'd by my meane deserts , Indeed you are not .
Thou couldst prate unhappilyEre thou couldst goe , would thou couldst doe as well.And how does your custome hold out here. Spa. Sir .
Are you in private still , or how ?
What doe you meane ?
Doe you take money ? are you come to sell sinne yet ? perhaps I canhelpe you to liberall Clients : or has not the King cast you off yet ? Othou wild creature , whose best commendation is , that thou art a youngWhore. I would thy Mother had liv 'd to see this : or rather would I haddyed ere I had seene it : why did'st not make me acquainted when thouwert first resolv 'd to be a Whore ? I would have seene thy hot lustsatisfied more privately. I would have kept a dancer , and a wholeconsort of Musitions in mine owne house , onely to fiddle thee. Spa.Sir I was never whore .
If thou couldst not say so much for thy selfe thou shouldst beCarted .
I have read it , and like it , You shall deliver it .
Well Sir I will : but I have private busines with you .
Speake , what ist ?
How has my age deserv 'd so ill of you , That you can picke no strumpets in the Land , But out of my breed .
Strumpets good Ligones ?
Yes , and I wish to have you know , I scorneTo get a Whore for any Prince alive , And yet scorne will not helpe me thinkes : My daughterMight have beene spar 'd , there were enough beside .
May I not prosper , but Shee 's innocentAs morning light for me , and I dare sweareFor all the world .
Why is she with you then ? Can she waite on you better then your men , Has she a gift in plucking off your stockings , Can she make Cawdles well , or cut your Comes , Why doe you keepe her with you ? For your QueeneI know you doe contemne her , so should IAnd every Subject else thinke much at it .
Let um thinke much , but tis more firme then earthThou seest thy Queene there .
Then have I made a faire hand , I cald her Whore , If I shall speake now as her Father , I can not chuseBut greatly rejoyce that she shall be a Queene : but ifI should speake to you as a Statesman shee were more fitTo be your Whore .
Get you about your businesse to Arbaces , Now you talke idlie .
Yes Sir , I will goe.And shall she be a Queene , she had more witThen her old Father when she ranne away : Shall shee be a Queene , now by my troth tis fine , Ile dance out of all measure at her wedding : Shall I not Sir ?
Yes marrie shalt thou .
He make these witherd Kexes beare my bodieTwo houres together above ground .
Nay , goe , my businesse requires haste .
Good God preserve you , you are an excellent King .
Farewell good Father .
Farewell sweete vertuous Daughter ; I never was so joyfull in my life , That I remember : shall shee be a Queene ? Now I perceive a man may weepe for joy , I had thought they had lied that said so .
Come my deare love .
But you may see anotherMay alter that againe .
Urge it no more ; I have made up a new strong constancie , Not to be shooke with eyes ; I know I haveThe passions of a man , but if I meeteWith any subject that shall hold my eyesMore firmely then is fit ; Ile thinke of thee , and runne away from it : let that suffice .
Three gentlemen without to speake with me ?
Yes Sir .
Let them come in .
They are enterd Sir already .
Now fellowes , your busines , are these the Gentlemen .
My Lord I have made bold to bring these Gentlemen my Friends ath'sword along with me .
I am afraid youle fight then .
My good Lord I will not , your Lordship is mistaken , Feare not Lord .
Sir I am sorrie fort .
I can aske no more in honor , Gentlemen you heare my Lord is sorrie .
Not that I have beaten you , but beaten one that will be beaten : one whose dull bodie will require launcing : As surfeits doe thediet , spring and full. Now to your swordmen , what come they forgood Captaine Stock-fish ?
It seemes your Lordship has forgot my name .
No , nor your nature neither , though they are things fitter Iconfesse for anything , then my remembrance , or anie honestmans , what shall these billets doe , be pilde up in my Wood-yard ?
Your Lordship holds your mirth still , God continue it : but forthese Gentlemen they come .
To sweare you are a Coward , spare your Booke , I doe beleeve it .
Your Lordship still drawes wide , they come to vouch under theirvaliant hands , I am no Coward .
That would be a shew indeed worth seeing : sirra be wise and takemoney for this motion , travell with it , and where the name of
has been knowne , or a good Coward stirring , twill yeeldmore then a tilting. This will prove more beneficiall to you , ifyou be thriftie , then your Captaineship , and more naturall ; Menof most valiant hands is this true ?
It is so most renowned , Tis somewhat strange .
Lord , it is strange , yet true ; wee have examined from your Lordshipsfoote there to this mans head , the nature of the beatings ; and we doefind his honour is come off cleane , and sufficient : This as our swordsshall helpe us .
You are much bound to you bilbow-men , I am glad you are straight again
have undergone a labour for you Bessus , would have puzzled hercules , with all his valour .
Your Lordship must understand we are no men ath ' Law , that take payfor our opinions : it is sufficient wee have cleer 'd our friend .
Yet here is something due , which I as toucht in conscience willdischarge Captaine ; Ile pay this rent for you .
Spare your selfe my good Lord ; my brave friends aime at nothing butthe vertue .
Thats but a cold discharge Sir for their paines .
O Lord , my good Lord .
Be not so modest , I will give you something .
They shall dine with your Lordship , that 's sufficient .
Something in hand the while ; ye rogues , ye apple-squiers : doe youcome hether with your botled valour , your windie frothe , to limitout my beatings .
I doe beseech your Lordship .
O good Lord .
Sfoote , what a many of beaten slaves are here ? get me a cudgellsirra , and a tough one .
More of your foot , I doe beseech your Lordship .
You shall , you shall dog , and your fellow beagle .
A this side good my Lord .
Off with your swords , for if you hurt my foote , Ile have youfleade you rascals .
Mines off my Lord .
I beseech your Lordship stay a little , my strap 's tied to mycodpiece point : Now when you please .
Captaine , these are your valiant friends , you long for a littletoo ?
I am verie well , I humblie thanke your Lordship .
Whats that in your pocket slave , my key you mungrell ? thybuttocks can not be so hard , out with't quicklie .
Here tis Sir , a small piece of Artillerie , that a gentleman adeare friend of your Lordships sent me with to get it mended Sir ; for it you marke , the nose is somewhat loose .
A friend of mine you rascall , I was never wearier of doingnothing , then kicking these two foote-bals .
Heres a good cudgell Sir .
It comes too late ; I am wearie , prethee doe thou beate um .
My Lord this is foule play ifaith , to put a fresh man upon us ; Men , are but men .
That jest shall save your bones , up with your rotten regiment , and be gone ; I had rather thresh , then be bound to kicke theseraskals , till they cride hold : Bessus you may put your hand tothem now , and then you are quit. Farewell , as you like this , pray visit mee againe , twill keepe me in good breath.2.Has a divellish hard foote , I never felt the like.1.Nor I , and yet Ime sure I ha felt a hundred.2.If he kicke thus ith dog-daies , he will be drie founderd : whatcure now Captaine , besides oyle of bayes ?
Why well enough I warrant you , you can goe.2.Yes , God be thanked ; but I feele a shrewd ach , sure he has sprangmy huckle bone.1.I ha lost a haunch .
A little butter friend , a little butter ; butter and parselie is asoveraigne matter : probatum est.1.Captaine , we must request your hands now to our honours .
Yes marrie shall ye , and then let all the world come , we arevaliant to our selves , and theres an end.1.Nay , then we must be valiant ; O my ribbes.2.O my small guts , a plague upon these sharpe toe 'd shooes , theyare murderers .
It is resolv 'd , I bore it whilst I could , I can no more , Hell open all thy gates , And I will thorough them ; if they be shut , Ile batter um , but I will find the placeWhere the most damn 'd have dwelling ; ere I end , Amongst them all they shall not have a sinne , But I may call it mine : I must beginneWith murder of my friend , and so goe onTo an incestuous ravishing , and endMy life and sinnes with a forbidden blowUpon my selfe .
What Tragedie is here ? That hand was never wont to draw a Sword , But it cride dead to something:
have you bid Gobrius come ?
How doe you Sir ?
Well , is he comming ?
Why Sir are you thus ? Why does your hand proclaime a lawlesse warreAgainst your selfe ?
Thou answerest me one question with another , Is Gobrius comming ?
Sir he is. Arb. Tis well .
I can forbeare your questions then , be goneSir , I have markt .
Marke lesse , it troubles you and me .
You are more variable then you were .
It may be so .
To day no Hermit could be humblierThen you were to us all .
And what of this ?
And now you take new rage into your eies , As you would looke us all out of the Land .
I doe confesse it , will that satisfie , I prethee get thee gone .
Sir I will speake .
Will ye ?
It is my dutie , I feare you will kill your selfe : I am a subject , And you shall doe me wrong i n't : tis my cause , And I may speake .
Thou art not traind in sinne , It seemes Mardonius : kill my selfe , by heavenI will not doe it yet ; and when I will , Ile tell thee then : I shall be such a creature , That thou wilt give me leave without a word.There is a method in mans wickednesse , It growes up by degrees ; I am not comeSo high as killing of my selfe , there areA hundred thousand sinnes twixt me and it , Which I must doe , I shall come toot at last ; But take my oath not now , be satisfied , And get thee hence .
I am sorrie tis so ill .
Be sorrie then , True sorrow is alone , grieve by thy selfe .
I pray you let mee see your sword put upBefore I goe ; Ile leave you then .
Why so ? What follie is this in thee ? is it notAs apt to mischiefe as it was before ? Can I not reach it thinkest thou ? these are toyesFor children to be pleas 'd with , and not men ; Now I am safe you thinke : I would the bookeOf Fate were here , my sword is not so sure , But I should get it out , and mangle thatThat all the destinies should quite forgetTheir fix't decrees , and hast to make us newFarre other Fortunes mine could not be worse , Wilt thou now leave me ?
God put into your bosome temperate thoughts , He leave you though I feare .
Goe , thou art honest , Why should the hastie errors of my youthBe so unpardonable , to draw a sinneHelpelesse upon me ?
There is the King , now it is ripe .
Draw neere thou guiltie man , That are the author of the loathedst crimeFive ages have brought forth , and heare me speakeCurses incurable , and all the evilsMans bodie or his spirit can receiveBe with thee .
Why Sir doe you curse me thus ?
Why doe I curse thee , if there be a manSubtill in curses , that exceedes the rest , His worst wish on thee. Thou hast broke my hart .
How Sir ? Have I preserv 'd you from a childe , From all the arrowes , malice or ambitionCould shoot at you , and have I this for pay ?
Tis true thou didst preserve me , and in thatWert crueller then hardned murderersOf infants and their mothers ; thou didst save meOnely till thou hadst studdied out a wayHow to destroy me cunningly thy selfe : This was a curious way of torturing .
What doe you meane ?
Thou knowst the evils thou hast done to me , Dost thou remember all those witching lettersThou sentst unto me to Armenia , Fild with the praise of my beloved Sister , Where thou extolst her beautie ; what had ITo doe with that , what could her beautie beTo me , and thou didst write how well shee lov 'd me , Doest thou remember this : so that I doatedSomething before I saw her .
This is true .
Is it , and I when I was returnd thou knowstThou didst pursue it , till thou woundst mee intoSuch a strange , and unbeleev 'd affection , As good men can not thinke on .
This I grant , I thinke I was the cause .
Wert thou ? Nay more , I thinke thou meantst it .
Sir I hate a lie.As I love God and honestie , I did : It was my meaning .
Be thine owne sad Judge , A further condemnation will not need : Prepare thy selfe to die .
Why Sir to die ?
Why wouldst thou live , was ever yet offenderSo impudent , that had a thought of mercyAfter confession of a crime like this ? Get out I can not , where thou hurlst me in , But I can take revenge , that 's all the sweetnesseLeft for me .
Now is the time , heare me but speake .
No , yet I will be farre more mercifullThen thou wert to me ; thou didst steale into me , And never gavest me warning : so much timeAs I give thee now , had prevented theeFor ever. Notwithstanding all thy sinnes , If thou hast hope , that there is yet a prayerTo save thee , turne , and speake it to your selfe .
Sir , you shall know your sinnes before you doe umIf you kill me .
I will not stay then .
Know you kill your Father .
How ?
You kill your Father .
My Father ? though I know it for a lieMade out of feare to save thy stained life : The verie reverence of the word comes crosse me , And ties mine arme downe .
I will tell you that shall heighten you againe , I am thyFather , I charge thee heare me .
If it should be so , As tis most false , and that I should be foundA bastard issue , the dispised fruiteOf lawlesse lust , I should no more admireAll my wilde passions : but another truthShall be wrung from thee : If I could come byThe spirit of paine , it should be powr 'd on thee , Till thou allowest thy selfe more full of liesThen he that teaches thee .
Turne thee about , I come to speake to thee thou wicked man , Heare me thou Tyrant .
I will turne to thee , Heare me thou Strumpet : I have blotted outThe name of mother , as thou hast thy shame .
My shame , thou hast lesse shame then anything : Why dost thou keepe my daughter in a prison ? Why dost thou call her Sister , and doe this ?
Cease thou strange impudence , and answere quickly , If thou contemn'st me , this will aske an answere , And have it .
Helpe me gentle Gobrius .
Guilt dare not helpe guilt , though they grow togetherIn doing ill , yet at the punishmentThey sever , and each flies the noyse of other , Thinke not of helpe , answere .
I will , to what ?
To such a thing as if it be a truth , Thinke what a creature thou hast made thy selfe , That didst not shame to doe , what I must blushOnely to aske thee : tell me who I am , Whose sonne I am , without all circumstance ; Be thou as hastie , as my Sword will beIf thou refusest .
Why you are his sonne .
His sonne ? Sweare , sweare , thou worse then woman damn 'd .
By all thats good you are .
Then art thou all that ever was knowne bad. Now isThe cause of all my strange misfortunes come to light : What reverence expects thou from a childeTo bring forth which thou hast offended Heaven , Thy husband and the Land : Adulterous witchI know now why thou wouldst have poyson 'd me , I was thy lust which thou wouldst have forgot : Thou wicked mother of my sinnes , and me , Shew me the way to the inheritanceI have by thee : which is a spacious worldOf impious acts , that I may soone possesse it : Plagues rott thee , as thou liv'st , and such diseasesAs use to pay lust , recompence thy deed .
You doe not know why you curse thus .
Too well : You are a paire of Vipers , and beholdThe Serpent you have got ; there is no beastBut if he knew , it has a pedigreeAs brave as mine , for they have more discents , And I am every way as beastly got , As farre without the compasse of a law , As they .
You spend your rage , and words in vaine , And raile upon a guesse : heare us a little .
No I will never heare , but talke awayMy breath , and die .
Why but you are no Bastard .
Howe 's that ?
Nor childe of mine .
Still you goe on in wonders to me .
Pray be more patient , I may bring comfort to you .
I will kneele , And heare with the obedience of a childe ; Good Father speake , I doe acknowledge you , So you bring comfort .
First know our last King your supposed FatherWas olde and feeble when he marryed her , And almost all the Land as shee past hopeOf issue from him .
Therefore shee tooke leaveTo play the whoore , because the King was old : Is this the comfort ?
What will you find outTo give me satisfaction , when you findHow you have injur 'd me : let fire consume mee , If ever I were whore .
Forbeare these starts , Or I will leave you wedded to despaire , As you are now : if you can find a temper , My breath shall be a pleasant westerne wind , That cooles , and blastes not .
Bring it out good Father , He lie , artd listen here as reverentlieAs to an Angell : If I breathe too loude , Tell me ; for I would be as still as night .
Our King I say was old , and this our QueeneDesired to bring an heire ; but yet her husbandShee thought was past it , and to be dishonestI thinke shee would not ; if shee would have beene , The truth is , shee was watcht so narrowlie , And had so slender opportunitie , Shee hardly could have beene : But yet her cunningFound out this way ; shee fain 'd her selfe with child , And postes were sent in haste throughout the Land , And God was humbly thankt in every Church , That so had blest the Queen , and prayers were madeFor her safe going , and deliverie : Shee fain 'd now to grow bigger , and perceiv'dThis hope of issue made her feard , and broughtA farre more large respect from everie man.And saw her power increase , and was resolv 'd , Since shee believ 'd shee could not have't indeede ; At least shee would be thought to have a child .
Doe I not heare it well : nay , I will makeNo noise at all ; but pray you to the point , Quicke as you can .
Now when the time was full , Shee should be brought abed ; I had a sonneBorne , which was you : This the Queene hearing of , Mov 'd me to let her have you , and such reasonsShee shewed me , as shee knew would tieMy secresie : shee sware you should be King ; And to be short , I did deliver youUnto her , and pretended you were dead ; And in mine owne house kept a Funerall , And had an emptie coffin put in earth : That night the Queene fain 'd hastilie to labour , And by a paire of women of her owne , Which shee had charm 'd , shee made the world believeShee was deliver 'd of you : you grew upAs the Kings sonne , till you were six yeere olde ; Then did the King die , and did leave to meProtection of the Realme ; and contrarieTo his owne expectation , left this QueeneTruly with Childe indeed of the faire Princesse
: Then shee could have torne her heire , And did alone to me yet durst not speakeIn publike ; for shee knew shee should be foundA Traytor , and her talke would have beene thoughtMadnesse or any thing rather then truth : This was the onely cause why shee did seekeTo poyson you , and I to keepe you safe : And this the reason why I sought to kindleSome sparke of love in you to faire Panthea , That shee might get part of her right agen .
And have you made an end now , is this all ? If not , I will be still till I am aged , Till all my heires are silver .
This is all .
And is it true say you Maddam ?
Yes , God knowes it is most true .
then is not my Sister .
No .
But can you prove this ? [ Gob. ] If you will give consent : else who dare goe about it .
Give consent ? Why I will have them all that know it racktTo get this from um : All that waites withoutCome in , what ere you be come in , and bePartakers of my Joy : O you are welcome .
the best newes , nay , draw no neererThey all shall heare it : I am found no King .
Is that so good newes ?
Yes , the happiest newes that ere was heard .
Indeed twere well for you , If you might be a little lesse obey 'd .
On , call the Queene .
Why she is there .
The Queene Mardonius , Panthea is the Queene , And I am plaine Arbaces , goe some one , She is in Gobrius house ; since I saw youThere are a thousand things delivered to meYou little dreame of .
So it should seeme : My Lord , What furi 's this .
Beleeve me tis no fury , All that he sayes is truth .
Tis verie strange .
Why doe you keepe your hats off Gentlemen , Is it to me ? in good faith it must not be : I can not now command you , but I pray youFor the respect you bare me , when you tookeMe for your King , each man clap on his hat at my desire .
We will : but you are not foundSo meane a man , but that you may be cover'dAs well as we , may you not ?
O not here , You may , but not I , for here is my Father in presence .
Where ?
Why there : O the whole storieWould be a wildernesse to loose thy selfeFor ever ; O pardon me deare Father , For all the idle , and unreverent wordsThat I have spoke in idle moodes to you : I am Arbaces , we all fellow subjects , Nor is the Queene Panthea now my Sister .
Why if you remember fellow subject Arbaces , I tolde you onceshe was not your sister , I say she look't nothing like you .
I thinke you did good Captaine Bessus .
Here will arise another question now amongst the Swordmen , whether I be to call him to account for beating me , now he'sprov 'd no King .
Sir , heres LigonesThe Agent for the Armenian King .
Where is he , I know your businesse good Ligones .
We must have our King againe , and will .
I knew that was your businesse , you shall haveYou King againe , and have him so againeAs never King was had. Goe one of youAnd bid Bacurius bring Tigranes hither , And bring the Ladie with him , that PantheaThe Queene Panthea sent me word this morningWas brave Tigranes mistresse .
Tis Spaconia .
I , I , Spaconia .
She is my daughter .
Shee is so , I could now tell any thingI never heard ; your King shall goe so homeAs never man went .
Shall he goe on 's head ?
He shall have Chariots easier than ayreThat I will have invented ; and nere thinkeHe shall pay any ransome ; and thy selfeThat art the Messenger shall ride before himOn a Horse cut out of an entire Diamond , That shall be made to goe with golden wheeles , I know not how yet .
Why I shall be madeFor ever , they belied this King with usAnd sayd he was unkind .
And then thy daughter , She shall have some strange thinke , wele have the KingdomeSold utterly , and put into a toy.Which she shall weare about her careleslySome where or other.See the vertuous Queene .
Behold the humblest subject that you haveKneele here before you. Pan. Why kneele youTo me that am your vassall ?
Grant me one request .
Alas , what can I grant you ? What I can I will .
That you will please to marry me , If I can prove it lawfull .
Is that all ? More willingly , then I would draw this ayre .
Ile kisse this hand in earnest .
Sir , Tigranes is comming though he made it strangeTo see the Princesse any more .
The Queene,
Thou meanest : O my Tigranes pardon me , Tread on my necke I freely offer it , And if thou beest so given ; take revenge , For I have injur 'd thee .
No , I forgive , And rejoice more that you have found repentance , Then I my libertie .
Maist thou be happieIn thy faire choice ; for thou art temperate : You owe no ransome to the state , know that ; I have a thousand joyes to tell you of , Which yet I dare not utter , till I payMy thankes to Heaven for um : will you goeWith me , and helpe me ; pray you doe .
I will .

237 ] Actus PrimusScena Prima [ Enter Gaspero , and Melitus ]
Sir , you 're the very friend I wish 'd to meet with , I have a large discourse invites your earTo be an Auditor .
And what concerns it ?
The sadly thriving progress of the lovesBetween my Lord , the Prince , and that great Lady , Whose insolence , and never-yet-match 'd Pride , Can by no Character be well exprest , But in her only name , the proud Erota .
Alas , Melitus , I should guess the bestSuccess your Prince could find from her , to beAs harsh as the event doth prove : but now'Tis not a time to pity passionate griefs , When a whole Kingdom in a manner lyesUpon its Death-Bed bleeding .
Who can tellWhether or no these plagues at onceHang over this unhappy Land for her sakeThat is a Monster in it ?
Here 's the miseryOf having a Child our Prince ; else I presumeThe bold Venetians had not dar 'd to attemptSo bloody an invasion .
Yet I wonderWhy ( Master Secretary ) still the SenateSo almost superstitiously adores
, the Venetian Lord , consideringThe outrage of his Countrymen --
The SenateIs wise , and therein just , for this Gonzalo , Upon a Massacre performed at SeaBy the Admiral of Venice , on a MerchantOf Candy , when the cause was to be heardBefore the Senate there , in open CourtProfessed , that the cruelty the AdmiralHad shewed , deserved not only fine , but death ; 238 ] For Candy then , and Venice were at peace : Since when upon a motion in the Senate , For Conquest of our Land , 't is known for certain , That only this Gonzalo dar 'd to oppose it , His reason was , because it too much savour'dOf lawless and unjust ambition.The Wars were scarce begun , but he ( in fearOf quarrels 'gainst his life ) fled from his Country , And hither came , where ( to confirm his truth ) I know , ( Melitus , ) he out of his own store , Hath monied Cassilanes the General .
What , without other pledges than CassilanesBare promise of payment ?
No , it may beHe has some [ pe ] tty Lordship to retire to ; But thus he hath done ; now 't is fit , Melitus , The Senate should be thankful , otherwiseThey should annihilate one of those LawsFor which this Kingdome is throughout the WorldUnfollowed and admired .
What Laws are those , Sir ? Let me so much importune you .
You shall , And they be worth your knowledge : briefly thus : Who e'r he be that can detect apparentlyAnother of ingratitude , for anyReceived Benefit , the Plaintiff mayRequire the Offenders life ; unless he pleaseFreely and willingly to grant remission .
By which strict Law , the Senate is in danger , Should they neglect Gonzalo ?
Right , the LawPermits a like equality to Aliens , As to a home-bred Patriot .
Pray Sir , the other ?
Know , Melitus , The elder Cretans flourished many years , In War , in Peace unparallel 'd , and they ( To spur heroic Spirits on to Vertue ) Enacted that what man so ere he were,239 ] Did noblest in the field against his enemy , So by the general voice approv 'd , and known , Might at his home-return , make his demandFor satisfaction , and reward .
They areBoth famous Laws indeed. [ Enter a Messenger ]
Master Secretary , The Senate is about to sit , and craveYour presence .
What , so suddenly ?
These LettersWill shew the causes why .
Heaven , thou art great , And worthy to be thanked !
Your countenance , Sir , Doth promise some good tidings .
O the bestAnd happiest for this land that e'r was told ! All the Venetian Forces are defeated .
How , Sir ?
And what doth add some delight more , There is amongst the Souldiers a contentionWho shall be the triumpher , and it standsDoubtful between a Father and his Son , Old Cassilanes , and young Antinous .
Why may not both demand it ?
The Law denies it , But where the Souldiers do not all consent , The Parties in contention , are refer'dTo plead before the Senate ; and from themUpon an open audience to be judg'dThe Chief , and then to make demands .
You ravish meWith wonder and delight .
Come ; as we walk , I shall more fully inform you. [ Exeunt.240 ] SCENE II [ Enter Cassilanes , Arcanes , Antinous , and Decius . ]
Admit no Souldier near us till the SenateHave took their places .
You are obey 'd , my Lord .
, fall off .
I shall .
Give leave Arcanes : Young man , come nearer to me : who am I ?
It were a sin against the pietyOf filial duty , if I should forgetThe debt I owe my Father on my knee : Your pleasure ?
What , so low ? canst thou find joints , Yet be an Elephant ? Antinous , rise ; Thou wilt belye opinion , and rebateThe ambition of thy gallantry , that theyWhose confidence thou hast bewitch 'd , should seeTheir little God of War , kneel to his Father , Though in my hand I did grasp Thunder .
Sir , For proof that I acknowledge you the AuthorOf giving me my Birth , I have discharg'dA part of my Obedience. But if nowYou should ( as cruel fathers do ) proclaimYour right , and Tyrant-like usurp the gloryOf my peculiar honours , not deriv'dFrom successary , but purchas 'd with my bloud , Then I must stand first Champion for my selfAgainst all interposers .
Boldly urg 'd , And proudly , I could love thee , did not angerConsult with just disdain , in open languageTo call thee most ungrateful. Say freely , Wilt thou resign the flatteries whereonThe reeling pillars of a popular breathHave rais 'd thy Giant-like conceit , to addA suffrage to thy Fathers merit ? speak.241 ]
Sir , hear me : were there not a ChronicleWell pen 'd by all their tongues , who can reportWhat they have seen you do ; or had you notBest in your own performance writ your self , And been your own text , I would undertakeAlone , without the help of Art , or Character , But only to recount your deeds in Arms , And you should ever then be fam 'd a PresidentOf living victory : But as you areGreat , and well worthy to be stiled Great , It would betray a poverty of SpiritIn me to obstruct my fortunes , or descent , If I should coward-like surrender upThe interest which the inheritance of your vertueAnd mine own thrifty fate can claim in honour : My Lord , of all the mass of Fame , which anyThat wears a Sword , and hath but seen me fight , Gives me , I will not share , nor yield one jot , One tittle .
Not to me ?
You are my Father , Yet not to you .
Ambitious Boy , how dar'st thouTo tell me , that thou wilt contend ?
Had IBeen slothful , and not follow 'd you in allThe streights of death , you might have justly thenReputed me a Bastard : 't is a crueltyMore than to murther Innocents , to takeThe life of my yet infant-honour from me .
, look upon this badge of age , Thy Father 's grey-hair 'd beard : full fifty years , ( And more than half of this , ere thou wert born ) I have been known a Souldier , in which timeI found no difference 'twixt War and Peace , For War was Peace to me , and Peace was War .
, mark me well ; there hath not liv'dThese fifty years a man whom Crete prefer'dBefore thy Father ; let me boldly boast , Thy Father , both for Discipline a [ n ] d Action242 ] Hath so long been the first of all his Nation ; Now , canst thou think it honest , charitable , Nay humane , being so young , my Son , my Child , Begot , bred , taught by me , by me thy Father , For one days service , and that on thy first , To rob me of a glory which I fought forA half of hundred years ?
My case observesBoth equity and presidents ; for Sir , That very day whereon you got your Fame , You took it from some other , who was thenChief in repute , as you are now , and has beenPerhaps as many years deserving thatWhich you gain 'd in a day , as I have mine .
But he was not my Father then , Antinous ; Thou leav'st out that .
Sir , had he been your Father , He had been then immortal ; for a FatherHeightens his reputation where his SonInherits it , as when you give us life , Your life is not diminish 'd but renew'dIn us when you are dead , and we are stillYour living Images .
So be thou curs'dIn thy posterity , as I in thee , Dishonourable Boy ; O shall that Sun , Which not a year yet since beheld me mountedUpon a fiery Steed , waving my Sword , And teaching this young Man to manage Arms , That was a raw , fresh Novice in the featsOf Chivalrie , shall that same Sun be witnessAgainst this Brat of his Ingratitude ? Who , to eclipse the light of my renown , Can no way hope to get a noble Name , But by the treading on his Father 's Greatness ; Thou wilt not yield ? [ Enter Arcanes ]
My life , but not the prizeMy Sword hath purchas'd.243 ]
The Senate , My Lord , are here at hand , and all the SouldiersBegin to throng about them .
Now , Arcanes , the --
What , Sir ?
Trifles will affront us ; thatFine fighting Stripling .
Let him have the shame o n't ; 'Please you withdraw on this side .
My great heartWas never quail 'd before .
My Lord , be confident , Let not your Father daunt you .
, whitherMust I withdraw ?
On this side. -- See , the SouldiersAttend your pleasure -- courage , Sir ; the Senate .
Way for the Senate. [ Enter Porphycio , Possenne , ( three Senators ) Gonzalo , Gaspero , Souldiers ] My good Lords I know notWhat tax of arrogance I may incurr , Should I presume , though courted by your Favours , To take a place amongst you ; I had ratherGive proof of my unfeign 'd humilityBy force , though mean , yet more becoming place , Than run the hazard of a doubtful censure .
My Lord , your wisdom is both known and try 'd ; We can not rank you in a nobler FriendshipThan your great service to the State deserves .
Will't please you , Sir ? [ Enter Fernando with Souldiers . ]
What 's here , my Lord Porphycio ? It must not be .
My Lord , you are too modest .
It is no season to be troublesome , Else -- but I have done : your Lordships are observ 'd .
Is the demandant ready ? 244 ]
He is ready .
Produce him then .
Before this sacred presence , I , by a general consent , am madeThe Souldiers voice , and to your gracious Wisedoms , Present as chief in Arms , his Countries Champion,
Most reverend Lords , you hear the lesser numberOf those who have been Guardians to this Country , Approve this Champion ; I , in all their names , Who fought for Candy , here present before youThe mightiest man in Arms , Antinous.Speak fellow Souldiers .
Stand by all , save the two Competitors .
My Lords , how much your Countrey owes you both , The due reward of your desertful gloriesMust to Posterity remain : but yetSince , by our Law , one only can make claimTo the proposed honours which you both ( It seems ) have truly merited , take leaveFreely to plead your rights ; we shall attend ye .
Wherein priority of voice is granted , Lord Cassilanes to you ; for that your rareAnd long experience in the Course of War , As well doth challenge it as the best priviledgeOf Order and Civility , for thatYou are your brave Opponents worthy Father.Say , Country-men , are you content ?
I , I .
With reverence to the Senate , is it lawfull , Without your Customes breach , to say a word ?
Say on my Lord Gonzalo .
I have heard , And with no little wonder , such high deedsOf Chivalrie discours 'd , that I confess , I do not think the Worthies while they liv'dAll nine , deserv 'd as much applause , or memorie , As this one : But who can do ought to gainThe crown of honour from him , must be somewhatMore than a man ; you tread a dangerous path , Yet I shall hear you gladly : for believe me , Thus much let me profess , in honours cause , I would not to my Father , nor my King , ( My Countries Father ) yield : if you transcendWhat we have heard , I can but only say , That Miracles are yet in use. I fearI have offended .
You have spoken nobly .
use your priviledge .
Princely Fathers , E 're I begin , one suit I have to make , 'T is just , and honourable.Porphycio Possenne : Speak , and have it .
That you would please the souldiers might all stand247 ] Together by their General .
'T is granted.All fall to yonder side : Go on , Antinous .
I shall be brief and plain : all what my Father ( This Countries Patron ) hath discours 'd , is true.Fellows in Arms : speak you , is't true ?
True , true .
It follows , that the blaze of my performanceTook light from what I saw him do : and thusA City ( though the flame be much more dreadfull ) May from a little spark be set on fire ; Of all what I have done , I shall give instanceOnly in three main proofs of my desert.First I sought out ( but through how many dangersMy Lords judge ye ) the chief , the great Commander , The head of that huge body , whose proud weightOur Land shrunk under , him I found and fought with , Fought with , and slew. Fellows in Arms , speak you , Is't true or not ?
True , true .
When he was faln , The hearts of all our adversariesBegan to quail , till young Fernando , sonTo the last Duke of Venice gather 'd head , And soon renew 'd the field , by whose exampleThe bold Venetians doubling strength and courageHad got the better of the day ; our menSupposing that their adversaries grewLike Hydra 's head , recoyle , and 'gan to flye : I follow 'd them ; and what I said , they know ; The summe o n't is ; I call 'd them back , new rankt them ; Led on , they follow 'd , shrunk not t [ i ] ll the end : Fellows in Arms is't true , or no ?
True , true .
Lastly , to finish all , there was but one , The only great exploit ; which was to take
prisoner , and that hand to handIn single fight I did : my self withoutThe help of any arm , save the arm of Heaven.Speak Souldiers , is it true , or no ? 248 ]
Behold my prisoner , Fathers .
This one manRuin 'd our Army , and hath glorifi 'd
in her robes of mightiness and conquest .
We need not use long circumstance of words,
thou art conquerer : the Senate , The souldiers , and thy valour have pronounc 'd it .
Make thy demand .
Please ye ( my Lords ) give leaveThat I may part .
No Cassilane , the CourtShould therein be dishonour 'd , do not imaginWe prize your presence at so slight a rate.Demand , Antinous .
Thus ( my Lords ) to witnessHow far I am from arrogance , or thinkingI am more valiant , though more favour'dThan my most matchless father , my demand is , That for a lasting memorie of his name , His deeds , his real , nay his royal worth , You set up in your Capitol in BrassMy Fathers Statue , there to stand for everA Monument and Trophy of his victories , With this Inscription to succeeding ages,
Cassilanes , Patron of Candy 's Peace,
Porphycio Possenne : It is granted. What more ?
No more .
How Boy ?
Thou art immortal , Both for thy Son-like pietie , and beautiesOf an unconquer 'd minde .
My Prisoner , Lords , To your more sacred wisedoms I surrender : Fit you his ransom ; half whereof I giveFor largess to the Souldiers : the other halfTo the erection of this monument .
Ambitious villain.249 ]
Thou art all un-imitable.My Lords , to work a certain peace for CandyWith Venice , use Fernando like a Prince ; His ransom I'le disburse what e 're it be : Yet you may stay him with you , till conditionsOf amitie shall be concluded on : Are ye content ?
We are , and ever restBoth friends and debters to your nobleness .

Sir , Heaven can tell , and my integrity , What I did , was but only to inforceThe Senates gratitude. I now acknowledge it .
Observe it Fathers , how this haughty boyGrows cunning in his envy of mine honours : He knows no mention can of me be made , But that it ever likewise must be told , How I by him was master 'd ; and for suretyThat all succeeding times may so report it , He would have my dishonour , and his TriumphsIngrav 'd in Brass : hence , hence proceeds the falshoodOf his insinuating piety.Thou art no child of mine : thee and thy bloud , Here in the Capitol , before the Senate , I utterly renounce : So thrift and fateConfirm me ; henceforth never see my face , Be , as thou art , a villain to thy Father.250 ] Lords I must crave your leaves : come , come Arcanes.

Now to what you have heard ; as no man canBetter than I , give you her Character ; For I have been both nurs 'd , and train 'd up toHer petulant humours , and been glad to bear them , Her Brother , my late Master , did no less : Strong apprehensions of her beauty hathMade her believe that she is more than woman : And as there did not want those flatterers'Bout the worlds Conquerour , to make him think , And did perswade him that he was a god ; So there be those base flies , that will not stickTo buzze into her ears she is an Angel , And that the food she feeds on is Ambrosia .
She should not touch it then , 't is Poets fare .
I may take leave to say , she may as wellDetermine of her self to be a goddess , With lesser flatterie than he a god : For she does conquer more , although not farther.Every one looks on her , dyes in despair , And would be glad to do it actually , To have the next age tell how worthily , And what good cause he had to perish so : Here beauty is superlative , she knows it , And knowing it , thinks no man can deserve , But ought to perish , and to dye for her : Many great Princes for her love have languish 'd , And given themselves a willing sacrifice , Proud to have ended so : And now there isA Prince so madded in his own passions , That he forgets the Royaltie he was born to , And deems it happiness to be her slave .
You talk as if you meant to winde me in , And make me of the number .
Sir , mistake me not , the service that I owe yeShall plead for me : I tell you what she is , What she expects , and what she will effect,252 ] Unless you be the miracle of men , That come with a purpose to behold , And goe away your self .
I thank you , I will do it : But pray resolve me , How is she stor 'd with wit ?
As with beauty , Infinite , and more to be admired at , Than medled with .
And walks her tongue the same gate with her feet ?
Much beyond : what e 're her heart thinks , she utters : And so boldly , so readily , as you would judgeIt penn 'd and studied. [ Enter Erota , Philander , Annophil , Hyparcha , MochingoAttendants ]

Still I must thank you.This is the most passionate , Most pitifull Prince , Who in the Caldron of affections , Looks as he had been par-boy'ld .
If I offend with too much loving you , It is a fault that I must still commit , To make your mercy shine the more on me .
You are the self-same creature you condemn , Or else you durst not follow me with hopeThat I can pity you , who am so farFrom granting any comfort in this kind , That you and all men else shall perish first : I will live free and single , till I findSomething above a man to equal me ; Put all your brave Heroes into one , Your Kings and Emperours , and let him comeIn person of a man , and I should scorn him : Must , and will scorn him.The god of love himself hath lost his eyes , His Bow and Torch extinguish 'd , and the PoetsThat made him first a god , have lost their fire253 ] Since I appear 'd , and from my eyes must steal it.This I dare speak ; and let me see the man , Now I have spoke it , that doth , dare deny ; Nay , not believe it .
He is mad that does not .

Where is my Father , that you come without him ? We have news of your success : he has his health I hope ?
Yes Sister , he has his health , but is not well .
How not well ? what Riddles do yo [ u ] utter ?
I'le tell you more in private .
Noble Sir , I can not be unmindfull of your merit , Since I last heard it : you are a hopefull youth , And ( indeed ) the Soul of Candy.I must speak my thoughts .
The Prince of Cyprus Brother , good Decius .
I am his Servant .
You are the Patron of your Countrie , Sir , So your unimitable deeds proclaim you , It is no language of my own , but all mens .
Your Enemies must needs acknowledge it : Then do not think it flatterie in your friends , For if they had a heart , they could not want a tongue .
Is this your Brother Annophil ?
Yes Madam .
Your name 's Antinous ? 256 ]
I am ( Lady ) that most unfortunate man .
How unfortunate ? are you not the Souldier , The Captain of those Captains , that did bringConquest and Victory home along with you ?
I had some share i n't ; but was the leastOf the least worthy .
O Sir , in your modesty you'ld makeA double Conquest : I was an ear-witnessWhen this young man spoke lesser than he acted , And had the Souldiers voice to help him out : But that the Law compell 'd him for his honour , To inforce him make a claim for his reward , I well perceive he would have stood the manThat he does now , buried his worth in silence .
Sir , I hearken not to him , but look on you , And find more in you than he can relate : You shall attend on me .
Madam , your pardon .
Deny it not Sir , for it is more honourThan you have gotten i'th ' field : for know you shall , Upon Erota 's asking , serve Erota .
I may want answers , Lady , But never want a will to do you service.I came here to my Sister , to take leave , Having enjoyn 'd my self to banishment , For some cause that hereafter you may hear , And wish with me I had not the occasion .
There shall be no occasion to divide us : Dear Madam for my sake use your power , Even for the service that he ought to owe , Must , and does owe to you , his friends , and country .
Upon your Loyalty to the state and me , I do command you Sir , not depart Candy : Am I not your Princess ?
You are a great Lady .
Then shew your self a Servant and a Subject .
I am your vassal .
You are a Coward ; I that dare not fight , Scorn to be vassail to any Prince in Europe : Great is my heart with pride , which I'le encrease257 ] When they are gone , with practise on my Vassals .

There 's comfort in those words , Antinous : For here 's the place , and persons that have power , To reconcile you to his love again .
That were a fortunate meeting. [ Enter Cassilane , and Arcanes . ]

Good Cassilane , we do maintain our greatness , Through your valour .
My prayers pull daily blessings on thy head , My un-offending child , my Annophel.Good Prince , worthy Gonzalo ! ha ? art thou hereBefore me ? in every action art thou ambitious ? My duty ( Lady ) first offered here , And love to thee ( my child ) though he out-strip me ; Thus in the wars he got the start on me , By being forward , but performing less ; All the endeavours of my life are lost , And thrown upon that evil of mine ownCursed begetting , whom I shame to father.O that the heat thou rob'dst me of , had burntWithin my Entrails , and begot a feaver , Or some worse sickness , for thou art a diseaseSharper than any Physick gives a name to .
Why do you say so ?
O Annophil ; there is good cause my girle : He has plaid the thief with me , and filch 'd awayThe richest jewel of my life , my honour , Wearing it publickly with that applause , As if he justly did inherit it .
Would I had in my Infancy been laidWithin my grave , covered with your blessings ratherThan grown up to a man , to meet your curses .
O that thou hadst.Then I had been the Father of a child , Dearer than thou wert ever unto me , When hope perswaded me I had begotAnother self in thee : Out of mine eyes,258 ] As far as I have thrown thee from my heart , That I may live and dye forgetting thee .
How has he deserv 'd this untam 'd anger , That when he might have ask't for his rewardSome honour for himself , or mass of pelf , He only did request to have erectedYour Statue in the Capitol , with TitlesIngrav 'd upo n't , The Patron of his Countrey ?
That , that 's the poison in the gilded cup , The Serpent in the flowers , that stings my honour , And leaves me dead in fame : Gods do a justice , And rip his bosom up , that men may see , Seeing , believe the subtle practisesWritten within his heart : But I am heated , And do forget this presence , and my self.Your pardon , Lady .
You should not ask , 'less you knew how to give.For my sake Cassilane , cast out of your thoughtsAll ill conceptions of your worthy son , That ( questionless ) has ignorantly offended , Declared in his penitence .
Bid me dye , Lady , for your sake I'le do it ; But that you'l say is nothing , for a manThat has out-liv 'd his honour : But command meIn any thing save that , and CassilaneShall ever be your servant. Come Annophel , ( My joy in this world ) thou shalt live with me , ( Retired in some solitarie nook , ) The comfort of my age ; my dayes are short , And ought to be well spent : and I desireNo other witness of them but thy self , And good Arcanes .
I shall obey you Sir .
Noble Sir : If you taste any want of worldly means , Let not that discontent you : know me your friend , That hath , and can supply you .
Sir , I am too much bound to you already , And 't is not of my cares the least , to give youFair satisfaction.259 ]
You may imagine I do speak to that end , But trust me , 't is to make you bolder with me .
Sir , I thank you , and may make trial of you , Mean time my service .
Brother be comforted ; so long as I continueWithin my Fathers love , you can not longStand out an Exile : I must goe live with him , And I will prove so good an OratorIn your behalf , that you again shall gain him , Or I will stir in him another anger , And be lost with you .
Better I were neglected : for he is hasty , And through the Choler that abounds in him , ( Which for the time divides from him his judgement ) He may cast you off , and with you his life ; For grief will straight surprize him , and that wayMust be his death : the sword has try 'd too often , And all the deadly Instruments of warHave aim 'd at his great heart , but ne 're could touch it : Yet not a limb about him wants a scar .

Will you be gone ?
I must , Lady , but I shall be ready , When you are pleas 'd command me , for your service.Excellent Prince -- To all my heartie love , And a good Farewel .
Thanks honest Cassilane .

From hence you shall not stir a foot : Loving Gonzalo , it must be all my studyTo requite you .
If I may be so fortunate to deserveThe name of friend from you , I have enough .
You are so , and you have made your self so .
I will then preserve it .

Have you not example here in a PrinceTranscending you in all things , yet bears himselfAs doth become a man had seen my beautie ?

how ?
thus : you see how through this Land , Both of the best and basest I am honour 'd ; I only gave the State of Venice notice , When , where , and how to land , or you had found262 ] A better entertainment : I was heEncourag 'd young Antinous to affrontThe Devil his Father : for the Devil I thinkDares not do more in battel .
But why did ye ? I find no such great policie in that .
Indeed Fernando , thou canst fight , not plot : Had they continu 'd one , they two aloneWere of sufficient courage and performanceTo beat an Armie .
Now by all my hopes , I rather shall admire , than envy vertue .
Why then by all your hopes you'l rather haveYour Brains knockt out , than learn how to be wise ; You States-man ? Well Sir , I did more than this , When Cassilane crav 'd from the common treasurePay for his Souldiers , I strook home , and lent himAn hundred thousand Duckets .
Marry Sir , The policy was little , the love l [ e ] ss , And honesty least of all .
How say ye by that ? Go fight , I say goe fight , I'le talk no more with you , You are insensible .
Well , I shall observe ye .
Why look you Sir , by this means have I gotThe greatest part of Cassilanes estateInto my hands , which he can ne 're redeem , But must of force sink : do you conceive me now ?
But why have you importuned the Senate , For me to sojourn with them ?
There 's the quintessence , The soul , and grand elixir of my wit : For he ( according to his noble nature ) Will not be known to want , though he do want , And will be bankrupted so much the sooner , And made the subject of our scorn and laughter .
Here 's a perfect plotted stratagem .

My wishes Sir , Have never soar 'd a higher flight , than trulyTo find occasion wherein I might witnessMy duty and obedience .
'T is well said , Canst thou forbear to laugh Arcanes ?
Why Sir ?
To look upon my beggerie , to look uponMy patience in my beggerie : Tell me , Does it shew handsom ? bravely ? Handsom ? thou wilt flatter me , And swear that I am miserable .
NothingMore glorifies the noble , and the valiant , Than to despise contempt : if you continueBut to enjoy your self , you in your selfEnjoy all store besides .
An excellent change : I that some seven Apprentice-ships commandedA hundred Ministers , that waited on265 ] My nod , and sometimes twenty thousand souldiers , Am now retir 'd , attended in my ageBy one poor maid , follow 'd by one old man .
Sir , you are lower in your own reputeThan you have reason for .
The Roman Captains , I mean the best , such as with their bloudsPurchas 'd their Countreys peace , the Empires glorie , Were glad at last to get them to some Farmes , Off-from the clamours of the ingratefull great ones , And the unsteady multitude , to liveAs I do now , and 't was their blessing too , Let it be ours Arcanes .

'T is the allOf my ambition .
And for proof how muchHe truly honours your heroick vertues , The Senate on his importunity , Commend him to your Lordships guard .
For what ?
During the time of his abode in Candy , To be your houshold guest .
Wherein my Lord , You shall more make me debtor to your nobleness , Than if you had return 'd me without ransom .
Are you in earnest Sir ?

Come hither Secretarie , Look that this be no trick now put upon me:267 ] For if it be -- Sirrah --
As I have troth ( My Lord ) it only is a favour grantedUpon Fernando 's motion , from himself : Your Lordship must conceive , I'de not partakeOught , but what should concern your honour ; WhoHas been the prop , our Countries shield , and safety , But the renowned Cassilane ?
Applause ? Is Gaspero -- puff -- nothing -- why , young Lord , Would you so much be sequester 'd from thoseThat are the blazing Comets of the time , To live a solitary life with me ? A man forsaken ? all my hospitalityIs now contracted to a few ; these two , The tempest-wearied Souldier , and this Virgin ; We can not feast your eyes with Masques and Revels , Or Courtly Anticks ; the sad Sports we riot in , Are tales of foughten fields , of Martial scars , And things done long ago , when men of courageWere held the best , not those well-spoken Youths , Who only carry Conquest in their tongues : Now stories of this nature are unseasonableTo entertain a great Duke 's Son with .
HereinShall my Captivity be made my happiness , Since what I lose in freedom , I regain ( With int'rest ) by conversing with a Souldier , So matchless for experience , as great Cassilane : 'Pray Sir , admit me .
If you , come to mock me , I shall be angry .
By the love I bearTo goodness , my intents are honourable .
Then in a word , my Lord , your visitationsShall find all due respect : but I am nowGrown old , and have forgot to be an Host ; Come when you please , you are welcome .

'T is well , an host of furiesCould not have baited me more torturingly , More rudely , or more most unnaturally .
, I say , let me no more hear from him ; For this time go thou hence , and know from meThou art beholding to me that I have notKill 'd thee already , look to't next , look to't .
fie , fie Annophel. [ Exit .
He 's gone ; Chaf 'd beyond sufferance ; we must follow him .
Lady , this Letter is to you .
Come with me , For we must speak in private ; 'please you , Sir , To see what entertainment our sad houseCan yield ? [ Exit .
I shall attend you , Lady .
How do you likeTo sojourn here , my Lord ?
More than to feastWith all the Princes of the Earth besides:
told me that thou wert honest .
Yes Sir , And you shall find it.271 ]
Shall I ?
All my folliesBe else recorded to my shame .
Enough , My heart is here for ever lodg 'd .
The Lady .
The place admits no time to utter all , But Gaspero if thou wilt prove my friend , I 'll say thou art --
Your Servant ; I conceive ye , We 'll chuse some fitter leisure .
Never manWas ( in a moment ) or more bless 'd or wretched. [ Exeunt. [ Enter Hyparcha ( placing two Chairs ) Antinous , and Erota . ]
Leave us .
I shall. [ Exit .
, sit down .
Madam .
I say sit down , I do command you sit ; For look what honour thou dost gain by me , I can not lose it : happy Antinous , The graces and the higher DeitiesSmil 'd at thy Birth , and still continue it : Then think that I ( who scorn lesser examples ) Must do the like : such as do taste my power , And talk of it with fear and reverence , Shall do the same unto the man I favour.I tell thee Youth , thou hast a conquest won , Since thou cam'st home , greater than that last , Which dignified thy Fame , greater than ifThou should'st go out again , and conquer farther ; For I am not ashamed to acknowledgeMy self subdued by thee .
Great Lady --
Sit still , I will not hear thee else ; now speak , And speak like my Antinous , like my Souldier , Whom Cupid , and not Mars hath sent to Battel .
I must ( I see ) be silent.272 ]
So thou maist ; There 's greater action in it than in clamour , A look ( if it be gracious ) will begin the War , A word conclude it ; then prove no Coward , Since thou hast such a friendly enemy , That teaches thee to conquer .
You do amaze me , Madam , I have no skill , no practice in this War , And whether you be serious , or pleaseTo make your sport on a dejected man , I can not rightly guess ; but be it as it will , It is a like unhappiness to me : My discontents bear those conditions in them , And lay me out so wretched , no designs ( However truly promising a good ) Can make me relish ought but a sweet-bitterVoluntary Exile .
Why an Exile ? What comfort can there be in those CompanionsWhich sad thoughts bring along with ? [ Enter Hyparcha ]
Madam. [ Musick .
Whence comes this well tun 'd sound ?
I know not , Madam .
Listen Wench ; What ever friendly hands they are that send it , [ Song.Let 'em play on ; they are Masters of their faculty : Doth it please you , Sir ?
According to the time .
Go to 'em , Wench , And tell 'em , we shall thank 'em ; for they have keptAs good time to our disposition , as to their instruments ; Unless Antinous shall say he loves , There never can be sweeter accents utter'd. [ Enter Philander . ]
Let then the heart that did employ those hands , Receive some small share of your thanks with them , 'T is happiness enough that you did like it ; 273 ] A fortune unto me , that I should send itIn such a lucky minute ; but to obtainSo gracious welcome did exceed my hopes .
Good Prince , I thank you for't .
O Madam , pour not ( too fast ) joys on me , But sprinkle 'em so gently I may stand 'em ; It is enough at first , you have laid asideThose cruel angry looks out of your eyes , With which ( as with your lovely ) you did strikeAll your Beholders in an Ecstasie .
, you have long profest to love me .
Have I but profest it , Madam ?
Nay , but hear me ?
More attentively than to an Oracle .
And I will speak more truly , if more can be ; Nor shall my language be wrapt up in Riddles , But plain as truth it self ; I love this Gentleman , Whose grief has made him so uncapableOf Love , he will not hear , at least not understand it.I , that have lookt with scornful eyes on thee , And other Princes , mighty in their states , And in their friends as fortunate , have now pray 'd , In a petitionary kind almost , This man , this well-deserving man , ( that I must say ) To look upon this beauty , yet you seeHe casts his eyes rather upon the ground , Than he will turn 'em this way ; Philander , You look pale ; I 'll talk no more .
Pray go forward ; I would be your Martyr , To dye thus , were immortally to live .
Will you go to him then , and speak for me ? You have loved longer , but not ferventer , Know how to speak , for you have done it likeAn Orator , even for your self ; then how will you for meWhom you profess to love above your self .
The Curses of Dissemblers follow meUnto my Grave , and if I do not so .
You may ( as all men do ) speak boldlier , betterIn their friends cause still , than in your own ; But speak your utmost , yet you can not feign,274 ] I will stand by , and blush to witness it.Tell him , since I beheld him , I have lostThe happiness of this life , food , and rest ; A quiet bosome , and the state I went with.Tell him how he has humbled the proud , And made the living but a dead Erota.Tell him withal , that she is better pleas'dWith thinking on him , than enjoying these.Tell him -- Philander , Prince ; I talk in vainTo you , you do not mark me .
Indeed I do .
But thou dost look so pale , As thou wilt spoil the story in relating .
Not , if I can but live to tell it .
It may be you have not the heart .
I have a will I am sure how e'r my heartMay play the Coward , but if you please , I 'll try .
If a kiss will strengthen thee , I give you leaveTo challenge it , nay , I will give it you .
O that a man should taste such heavenly bliss , And be enjoyn 'd to beg it for another !
Alas , it is a misery I grieveTo put you to , and I will suffer ratherIn his tyranny , than thou in mine .
Nay Madam , since I can not have your love , I will endeavour to deserve your pity ; For I had rather have within the graveYour love , than you should want it upon earth.But how can I hope , with a feeble tongueTo instruct him in the rudiments of love , When your most powerful Beauty can not work it ?
Do what thou wilt ( Philander ) the requestIs so unreasonable , that I quit thee of it.I desire now no more but the true patience , And fortitude of Lovers , with those helpsOf sighs and tears , which I think is all the Physick --
O if he did but hear you 'twere enough ; And I will 'wake him from his Apoplexie .
My Lord ? 275 ]
Nay , 'pray , No courtesie to me , you are my Lord , ( Indeed you are ) for you command her heartThat commands mine ; nor can you want to know it.For look you , she that told it you in words , Explains it now more passionately in tears ; Either thou hast no heart , or a marble one , If those drops can not melt it ; prithee look upAnd see how sorrow sits within her eyes , And love the grief she goes with ( if not her ) Of which thou art the Parent ; and never yetWas there ( by Nature ) that thing made so stonyBut it would love what ever it begot .
He that begot me did beget these caresWhich are good issues , though happily by himEsteemed Monsters : Nay , the ill-judging WorldIs likely enough to give them those Characters .
What 's this to love , and to the Lady ? he 's old , Wrathful , perverse , self-will 'd , and full of anger , Which are his faults ; but let them not be thine ; He thrusts you from his love , she pulls thee on ; He doubts your Vertues , she doth double them ; O either use thine own eyes , or take mine , And with them my heart , then thou wilt love her , Nay , dote upon her more than on thy duty , And men will praise thee equally for it , Neglecting her , condemn thee as a manUnworthy such a fortune : O Antinous , 'T is not the friendship that I bear to thee , But her command , that makes me utter this ; And when I have prevail 'd , let her but say,
, you must dye or this is nothing , It shall be done together with a breath , With the same willingness I live to serve her .
No more , Philander .
All I have done , is little yet to purpose , But ere I leave him I will perceive him blush ; And make him feel the passions that I do , And every true Lover will assist me i n't , And lend me their sad sighs to blow it home,276 ] For Cupid wants a Dart to wound this bosome .
No more , no more , Philander , I can endure no more , Pray let him go ; go good Antinous , make peaceWith your own mind , no matter though I perish. [ Ex.Actus QuartusScena Prima [ Enter Hyparcha , and Mochingo ]
I Can not help it .
Nor do I require it , The malady needs no Physician , Help hospital people .
I am glad to hearYou are so valiant .
Valiant ? Can any man be proud that is not valiant ? Foolish Woman , what would'st thou say ? thou -- know not what to call thee .
I can you , For I can call you Coxcomb , Ass , and Puppy .
You do doe it , I thank you .
That you 'll lose a Fortune , Which a Cobler better deserves than thou dost .
Do not provoke my magnanimity , For when I am incens 'd I am insensible , Go tell thy Lady , that hath sent me wordShe will discard me , that I discard her , And throw a scorn upon her , which I would not , But that she does me wrong. [ Enter Erota , and Antinous . ]
Do you not glory in your Conquest more , To take some great man Prisoner , than to kill him ? And shall a Lady find less mercy from you , That yields her self your Captive , and for her Ransome , Will give the Jewel of her life , her heart , Which she hath lockt from all men but thy self ? For shame ( Antinous ) throw this dulness off ; Art thou a man no where but in the field ? 277 ]
He must hear Drums , and Trumpets ere he sleeps , And at this instant dreams he 's in his Armour ; These iron-hearted Souldiers are so cold , Till they be beaten to a Womans Arms , And then they love 'em better than their own ; No Fort can hold them out .
What pity it is ( Madam ) that your self , Who are all Excellence , should become so wretched , To think on such a Wretch as Grief hath made me ! Seldome despairing men look up to Heaven , Although it still speak to 'em in its Glories ; For when sad thoughts perplex the mind of man , There is a Plummet in the heart that weighs , And pulls us ( living ) to the dust we came from ; Did you but see the miseries you pursue , ( As I the happiness that I avoidThat doubles my afflictions ) you would flyeUnto some Wilderness , or to your Grave , And there find better Comforts than in me , For Love and Cares can never dwell together .
They should , If thou hadst but my Love and I thy Cares .
What wild Beast in the Desart but would beTaught by this Tongue to leave his Cruelty , Though all the beauties of the face were vail 'd ! But I am savager than any Beast , And shall be so till Decius does arrive , Whom with so much submission I have sentUnder my hand , that if he do not bringHis Benediction back , he must to meBe much more cruel than I to you .
Is't but your Fathers pardon you desire ?
With his love , and then nothing next that , like yours. [ Enter Decius ]
is come .
O welcome Friend ; if I apprehend notToo much of joy , there 's comfort in thy looks .
There is indeed ; I prithee Decius speak it .
How ! prithee Decius ! this Woman 's strangely alter'd.278 ]
Why dost not speak ( good friend ) and tell me howThe reverend Blessing of my life receiv'dMy humble lines ; wept he for joy ?
No , there 's a Letter will inform you more ; Yet I can tell you what I think will grieve you , The Old Man is in want and angry still , And poverty is the Bellows to the CoalMore than distaste from you as I imagine .
What 's here ? how 's this ? It can not be ! now sureMy griefs delude my senses .
In his looksI read a world of Changes ; Decius , markWith what a sad amazement he surveysThe News ; canst thou guess what 't is ?
None good , I fear .
I fear so too ; and then --
It is her hand .
Are you not well ?
Too well : if I were oughtBut Rock , this Letter would conclude my miseries , Peruse it ( Lady ) and resolve me then , In what a case I stand .
Sir , the worst is , Your Fathers lowness and distaste .
No , Decius , My Sister writes Fernando has made suitFor love to her ; and to express sincerelyHis constant truth , hath like a noble Gentleman , Discovered plots of treachery ; contriv'dBy false Gonzalo , not intending moreThe utter ruine of our house , than generally
Confusion .
'T is a generous partOf young Fernando .
'T is , and I could wishAll thrift to his affections , Decius.You find the sum o n't , Madam .
Yes , I do .
And can you now yet think a heart opprestWith such a throng of cares , can entertain279 ] An amorous thought ? Love frees all toils but one , Calamity and it can ill agree .
Wil't please you speak my doom ?
Alas , great Lady , Why will you flatter thus a desperate ManThat is quite cast away ? O had you notProcur 'd the Senates Warrant to enforceMy stay , I had not heard of these sad News.What would ye have me do ?
Love me , or kill me , One word shall sentence either ; for as TruthIs just , if you refuse me , I am resoluteNot to out-live my thraldome .
Gentle Lady .
Say , must I live , or dye ?
My Lord , how can youBe so inexorable ? here 's OccasionOf succouring your Father in his wantsSecurely profer 'd , pray Sir , entertain it .
What is my sentence ?
What you please to have it .
As thou art gentle speak those words again .
Madam , you have prevail 'd ; yet give me leaveWithout offence , ere I resign the interestYour heart hath in my heart , to prove your secresie .
, 't is the greatest argumentOf thy affections to me .
Madam , thus then , My Father stands for certain sums engag'dTo treacherous Gonzalo ; and has morgag'dThe greatest part of his estate to him ; If you receive this Morgage , and procureAcquittance from Gonzalo to my Father , I am what you would have me be .
You 'll love me then ?
Provided ( Madam ) that my Father know notI am an Agent for him .
If I failIn this , I am unworthy to be lov 'd .
Then ( with your favour ) thus I seal my truth,280 ] To day , and Decius witness how unchanginglyI shall still love Erota .
Thou hast quicknedA dying heart , Antinous .
This is well ; Much happiness to both. [ Enter Hyparcha ]
The Lord GonzaloAttends you , Madam .
Comes as we could wish , Withdraw Antinous , here 's a Closet , whereYou may partake his errand ; let him enter. [ Enter Gonzalo ]
Madam you must be wary. [ Exit
Fear it not , I will be ready for him ; to entertain himWith smiling Welcome. Noble Sir , you takeAdvantage of the time ; it had been fitSome notice of your presence might have fashion'dA more prepared state .
Do you mock me , Madam ?
Trust me , you wrong your judgment , to reputeMy Gratitude a fault ; I have examin'dYour portly carriage , and will now confessIt hath not slightly won me .
The Wind 's turn 'd ; I thought 'twould come to this ; it pleas 'd us , Madam , At our last interview , to mention Love ; Have you consider 'd o n't ?
With more than common
( As I have cause to doubt ) then --
What , ( sweet Lady ? )
Methinks we should lay by this form of stateliness ; Loves Courtship is familiar , and for instance , See what a change it hath begot in me , I could talk humbly now , as Lovers use .
And I , and I , we meet in one self-centre281 ] Of blest Consent .
I hope my weakness , Sir , Shall not deserve neglect ; but if it prove soI am not the first Lady has been ruin'dBy being too credulous ; you will smart for't one day .
Angel-like Lady , let me be held a Villain , If I love not sincerely .
Would I knew it .
Make proof by any fit Command .
What , do you mean to marry me ?
How ! mean ? nay more , I meanTo make you Empress of my Earthly Fortunes , Regent of my desires , for did you covetTo be a real Queen , I could advance you .
Now I perceive you slight me , and would make meMore simple than my Sexes frailty warrants .
But say your mind , and you shall be a Queen .
On those Conditions , call me yours .
Enough.But are we safe ?
Assuredly .
In short , Yet , Lady , first be plain ; would you not chuseMuch rather to prefer your own Sun-rising , Than any 's else though ne'r so near entituledBy Blood , or right of Birth ?
'T is a questionNeeds not a resolution .
Good ; what ifI set the Crown of Candy on your head ?
I were a Queen indeed then .
Madam , knowThere 's but a Boy 'twixt you and it ; suppose himTranshap 'd into an Angel .
Wise Gonzalo , I can not but admire thee .
'T is worth thinking on ; Besides , your Husband shall be Duke of Venice .
, Duke of Venice ?
You are mine you say ? 282 ]
In a rich golden dream .
You are too much distrustfull of my truth .
Then you must give me leave to apprehendThe means , and manner how .
Why thus --
You shall not , We may be over-heard ; Affairs and counselsOf such high nature , are not to be trustedNot to the Air it self , you shall in writing , Draw out the full design ; which if effected , I am as I profess .
O I applaudYour ready care , and secresie .
, There is a bar yet , 'twixt our hopes and us , And that must be remov 'd .
What is't ?
Old Cassilane .
Ha ? fear not him : I build upon his ruinesAlready .
I would find a smoother courseTo shift him off .
As how ?
We'l talk in private , I have a ready plot .
I shall adore you. [ Exeunt. [ Enter Fernando , a [ n ] d Annophel ]
Madam , although I hate unnoble practices , And therefore have perform 'd no more than whatI ought , for honours safety : yet Annophel , Thy love hath been the spur , to urge me forwardFor speedier diligence .
Sir your own fameAnd memory will best reward themselves .
All gain is loss ( sweet beauty ) if I missMy comforts here : The Brother and the SisterHave double conquer 'd me , but thou maist triumph .
Good Sir , I have a Father.283 ]
Yes , a brave one ; Could'st thou obscure thy beauty , yet the happinessOf being but his Daughter , were a dowerFit for a Prince : what say ye ?
You have deserv'dAs much as I should grant .
By this fair handI take possession .
What in words I dare not , Imagine in my silence .
Thou art all vertue. [ Enter Cassilanes , and Arcanes ]
I'le tell thee how : Baldwin the Emperour , Pretending title , more through tyranny , Than right of conquest , or descent , usurp'dThe stile of Lord o 're all the Grecian Islands , And under colour of an amityWith Creet , prefer 'd the Marquess MountferatoTo be our Governor ; the Cretians vex'dBy the ambitious Turks , in hope of aidFrom the Emperour , receiv 'd for General , This Mountferato ; he ( the wars appeased ) Plots with the state of Venice and takes moneyOf them for Candy : they paid well , he stealsAway in secret ; since which time , that rightThe state of Venice claims o 're Candy , isBy purchase , not inheritance or Conquest : And hence grows all our quarrel .
So an UsurerOr Lumbard-Jew , might with some bags of trash , Buy half the Western world .
Mony , Arcanes , Is now a God on Earth : it cracks virginities , And turns a Christian , Turk ; Bribes justice , cut-throats honour , does what not ?
Not captives Candy .
Nor makes thee dishonest , Nor me a Coward -- -Now Sir , here is homely , But friendly entertainment.284 ]
Sir , I find it .
And like it , do ye not ?
My repair speaks for me .
we are speaking off -- how this ? [ Enter Gonzalo , and Gaspero , with a Casket ]
Your friend , and servant .
Creditors , my Lord , Are Masters and no Servants : as the world goes , Debters are very slaves to those to whomThey have been beholding to ; in which respect , I should fear you Gonzalo .
Me , my Lord ? You owe me nothing .
What , nor love , nor mony ?
Yes , love , I hope , not mony .
All this braverieWill scarcely make that good .
'T is done already : See Sir , your Mortgage which I only took , In case you and your son had in the wars
Are ye so conscionable ?
'T is your own .
Pish , pish , I'le not receive what is not mine , That were a dangerous business .
Sir , I am paid for't , The summes you borrowed , are return 'd ; The bondsCancel 'd , and your acquittance formerly seal 'd : Look here Sir , Gaspero is witness to it .
My honoured Lord , I am .
My Lord Fernando,
and the rest , you all shall testifie , That I acquit Lord Cassilane for ever , Of any debts to me .
'T is plain and ample : Fortune will once again smile on us fairly .
But hark ye , hark ye , if you be in earnest , Whence comes this bounty ? or whose is't ?
In short,285 ] The great Erota by this Secretary , Return 'd me my full due .
? whyShould she do this ?
You must ask her the cause , She knows it best .
So ho , Arcanes , noneBut women pity us ? soft-hearted women ? I am become a brave fellow now , Arcanes , Am I not ?
Why Sir , if the gracious PrincessHave took more special notice of your services , And means to be more thankfull than some others , It were an injury to gratitude , To disesteem her favours .
Sir she everFor your sake most respectively lov 'd me .
The Senate , and the body of this KingdomAre herein ( let me speak it without arrogance ) Beholding to her : I will thank her for it ; And if she have reserv 'd a means wherebyI may repay this bounty with some service , She shall be then my Patroness : come Sirs , We'I taste a cup of wine together now .
, I must speak with you in secret .
You shall -- Now Gaspero , all 's well .

Yes , you are setUpon a bench of justice ; and a dayWill come ( hear this , and quake ye potent great ones ) When you your selves shall stand before a judge , Who in a pair of scales will weigh your actions , Without abatement of one grain : as thenYou would be found full weight , I charge ye fathersLet me have justice now .

More uproars yet ! who are they that disturb us ?
The viper 's come ; his fears have drawn him hither , And now , my Lords , be Ch [ ro ] nicled for ever , And give me justice against this vile Monster , This bastard of my bloud .
'T is justice , Fathers , I sue for too : and though I might command it , ( If you remember Lords , whose child I was ) Yet I will humbly beg it ; this old wretchHas forfeited his life to me .
Tricks , tricks ; Complots , devices , 'twixt these pair of young-ones , To blunt the edge of your well temper 'd Swords , Wherewith you strike offenders , Lords , but IAm not a baby to be fear 'd with bug-bears , 'T is justice I require .
And I .
You speak too tenderly ; and too much like yourselfTo mean a cruelty ; which would make monstrousYour Sex : yet for the loves sake , which you oncePleas 'd to pretend , give my griev 'd Father leaveTo urge his own revenge ; you have no causeFor yours : keep peace about ye .
Will you hear me ? 289 ]
Here 's some strange novelty .
Sure we are mock 'd , Speak one at once : say wherein hath your SonTransgress 'd the Law ?
Can this be so Antinous ?
'T is all true , Nor hath my much wrong 'd father limn 'd my faultsIn colours half so black , as in themselves , My guilt hath dy 'd them : were there mercy left , Yet mine own shame would be my Executioner : Lords , I am guilty .
Thou beliest , Antinous , Thine innocence : alas , my Lords , he 's desperate , And talks he knows not what : you must not credit290 ] His lunacy ; I can my self disproveThis accusation : Cassilane , be yetMore mercifull ; I beg it .
Time , not fate , The world , or what is in it , shall not alterMy resolution : he shall dye .
The SenatsPrayers , or weeping Lovers , shall not alterMy resolution : thou shalt dye .
Why Madam , Are ye all Marble ?
Leave your shifts Antinous , What plead you to your Fathers accusation ?
Most fully guilty .
You have doom 'd your self , We can not quit you now .
A burthen 'd conscienceWill never need a hang-man : hadst thou dar'dTo have deni 'd it , then this Sword of mineShould on thy head have prov 'd thy tongue a lyar .
Thy sword ? wretched old man , thou hast liv 'd too longTo carry peace or comfort to thy grave ; Thou art a man condemn 'd : my Lords , this tyrantHad perish 'd but for me , I still suppli'dHis miserable wants ; I sent his DaughterMony to buy him food ; the bread he eat , Was from my purse : when he ( vain-gloriously ) To dive into the peoples hearts , had pawn'dHis birth-right , I redeem 'd it , sent it to him , And for requitall , only made my suite , That he would please to new receive his sonInto his favour , for whose love I told himI had been still so friendly : but then heAs void of gratitude , as all good nature , Distrafted like a mad man , poasted hitherTo pull this vengeance on himself , and us ; For why , my Lords , since by the Law , all meansIs blotted out of your commission , As this hard hearted Father hath accus'dNoble Antinous , his unblemished Son,291 ] So I accuse this Father , and crave judgement .
All this is but deceit , meer trifles forg'dBy combination to defeat the processOf Justice , I will have Antinous life .
Sir , what do ye mean ?
I will have Cassilane 's .
Cunning and cruel Lady , runs the streamOf your affections this way ? have you notConquest enough by treading on my grave ? Unless you send me thither in a shrowdSteept in my fathers bloud ? as you are woman , As the protests of love you vow 'd were honest ; Be gentler to my Father .
Cassilane , Thou hast a heart of flint : let my intreaties , My tears , the Sacrifice of griefs unfeigned , Melt it : yet be a Father to thy son , Unmask thy long besotted judgement , seeA low obedience kneeling at the feetOf nature , I beseech you .
Pish , you cozenYour hopes : your plots are idle : I am resolute .
, urge no further .
Hence thou SorceryOf a beguiling softness , I will stand , Like the earths center , unmov 'd ; Lords your breathMust finish these divisions : I confessCivility doth teach I should not speakAgainst a Lady of her birth , so highAs great Erota , but her injuriesAnd thankless wrongs to me , urge me to cryAloud for justice , Fathers .
Whither run you ?
For ( honoured fathers ) that you all may knowThat I alone am not unmatchableIn crimes of this condition , lest perhapsYou might conceive , as yet the case appears , That this foul stain , and guilt runs in a bloud ; Before this presence , I accuse this LadyOf as much vile ingratitude to me.292 ]
Impudent Traitor !
Her ? O spare Antinous ; The world reputes thee valiant , do not soyleAll thy past nobleness with such a cowardize.As murthering innocent Ladies will stamp on thee .
Brave Prince , with what unwillingness I forceHer follies , and in those her sin , be witness , All these about me : she is bloudy minded , And turns the justice of the Law to rigor : It is her cruelites , not I accuse her : Shall I have Audience ?
Let him speak my Lords .
Your memory will rot .
Cast all your eyesOn this , what shall I call her ? truthless woman , When often in my discontents , the swayOf her unruly bloud , her untam 'd passion , ( Or name it as you list ) had hour by hourSolicited my love , she vow 'd at lastShe could not , would not live unless I grantedWhat she long sued for : I in tender pity , To save a Lady of her birth from ruine , Gave her her life , and promis 'd to be hers : Nor urg 'd I ought from her , but secresie , And then enjoyn 'd her to supply such wantsAs I perceiv 'd my Fathers late engagementsHad made him subject to ; what shall I heap upLong repetitions ? she to quit my pity , Not only hath discover 'd to my FatherWhat she had promis 'd to conceal , but alsoHath drawn my life into this fatal forfeit ; For which since I must dye , I crave a likeEquality of justice against her ; Not that I covet bloud , but that she may notPractise this art of falsehood on some other , Perhaps more worthy of her love hereafter .
If this be true --
My Lords , be as the Law is , Indifferent , upright , I do plead guilty : Now Sir , what glory have you got by this ? 293 ] 'Las man , I meant not to outlive thy doom , Shall we be friends in death ?
Hear me , the villainScandals her , honour 'd Lords .
Leave off to doat , And dye a wise man .
I am over-reach 'd , And master 'd in my own resolution .
Will ye be wilfull Madam ? here 's the curseOf loves disdain .
Why sit you like dumb Statues ? Demur no longer .
, Erota,
, death ye ask ; and 't is your dooms , You in your follies liv 'd , dye in your follies .
I am reveng 'd , and thank you for it .
Yes , and I : Antlnous hath been gracious .
Sir , may I presume to crave a blessing from youBefore we part ?
Yes , such a one as ParentsBestow on cursed sons , now now , I laughTo see how those poor younglings are both cheatedOf life and comfort : look ye , look ye , Lords , I go but some ten minutes ( more or less ) Before my time , but they have finely cozen'dThemselves of many , many hopefull yearsAmidst their prime of youth and glory ; now [ Enter Annophel ] My vengeance is made full. Welcom my joy , Thou com'st to take a seasonable blessingFrom thy half buried Fathers hand ; I am deadAlready girle , and so is she and he , We all are worms-meat now .
I have heard all ; Nor shall you dye alone : Lords on my kneesI beg for justice too .
'Gainst whom , for what ?
First let me be resolv 'd ; does the Law favourNone , be they ne 're so mighty ? 294 ]
Not the greatest .
Then justly I accuse of foul ingratitudeMy Lords , you of the Senate all , not oneExcepted.Possenne Porphycio : Us ?
--
You are the AuthorsOf this unthrifty bloud-shed ; when your enemiesCame marching to your gates , your children suck 'd notSafe at their Mothers breasts , your very CloystersWere not secure , your starting-holes of refugeNot free from danger , nor your lives your own : In this most desperate Ecstasie , my Father , This aged man , not only undertookTo guard your lives , but did so ; and beat offThe daring foe ; for you he pawn 'd his lands , To pay your Souldiers , who without their payRefus 'd to strike a blow : but , Lords , when peaceWas purchas 'd for you , and victorie brought home , Where was your gratitude , who in your CoffersHoarded the rustic treasure which was dueTo my unminded Father ? he was gladTo live retir 'd in want , in penurie , Whilst you made feasts of surfeit , and forgotYour debts to him : The sum of all is this , You have been unthankfull to him ; and I craveThe rigor of the Law against you all .
My Royal spirited daughter !
Thou art a worthy wench ; let me embrace thee .
Lords , why do ye keep your seats ? they are no placesFor such as are offenders .
Though our ignoranceOf Cassilanes engagements might asswageSeverity of justice , yet to shewHow no excuse should smooth a breach of Law , I yield me to the trial of it .
So must I : Great Prince of Cyprus , you are leftThe only Moderator in this difference ; 295 ] And as you are a Prince be a ProtectorTo wofull Candy .
What a Scene of miserieHath thine obdurate frowardness ( old man ) Drawn on thy Countries bosom ? and for thatThy proud ambition could not mount so highAs to be stil 'd thy Countries only Patron , Thy malice hath descended to the depthOf Hell , to be renowned in the TitleOf the destroyer ? dost thou yet perceiveWhat curses all posterity will brandThy grave with ? that at once hast rob 'd this KingdomOf honour and of safety .
Children yet unbornWill stop their ears when thou art nam 'd .
The world will be too little to containThe memorie of this detested deed ; The Furies will abhorr it .
What the swordCould not enforce , your peevish thirst of honour ( A brave , cold , weak , imaginarie fame ) Hath brought on Candy : Candy groans , not theseThat are to die .
'T is happiness enoughFor them , that they shall not survive to seeThe wounds wherewith thou stab'st the land that gaveThee life and name .
'T is Candy 's wrack shall feel --
The mischief of your folly.Porphycio Possenne:
--
I will not be entreated .
Prethee Annophel .
Why would ye urge me to a mercy whichYou in your self allow not ?
'T is the Law , That if the party who complains , remitThe offender , he is freed : is't not so Lords ? Porphycio Possenne : 'T is so .
, By my shame observeWhat a close witch-craft popular applause is:296 ] I am awak 'd , and with clear eyes beholdThe Lethargie wherein my reason longHath been be-charm 'd : live , live , my matchless son , Blest in thy Fathers blessing ; much more blestIn thine own vertues : let me dew thy cheeksWith my unmanly tears : Rise , I forgive thee : And good Antinous , if I shall be thy FatherForgive me : I can speak no more .
Dear Sir , You new beget me now -- Madam your pardon , I heartily remit you .
I as freelyDischarge thee Cassilane .
My gracious Lords , Repute me not a blemish to my Sex , In that I strove to cure a desperate evilWith a more violent remedy : your lives , Your honours are your own .
Then with consentBe reconcil 'd on all sides : Please you FathersTo take your places .
Let us again ascend , With joy and thankfulness to Heaven : and nowTo other business Lords. [ Enter Gaspero , and Melitus , with Gonzalo ]
Two hours and more Sir , The Senate hath been set .
And I not know it ? Who sits with them ?
My Lord , the Prince of Cyprus .
Gaspero , Why how comes that to pass ?
Some weighty causeI warrant you .
Now Lords the business ? ha ? Who 's here , Erota ?
Secretarie do your chargeUpon that Traitor .
Traitor ? 297 ]
Yes , Gonzalo , Traitor , Of treason to the peace and state of Candy , I do arrest thee .
Me ? thou Dog ? [ Enter Fernando , and Michael ]
With LicenceFrom this grave Senate , I arrest thee likewiseOf treason to the State of Venice .
Ha ? Is Michael here ? nay then I seeI am undone .
I shall not be your Queen , Your Dutchess , or your Empress .
Dull , dull brain.O I am fool 'd !
Look Sir , do you know this hand ?
Do you know this Seal ? First , Lords , he writes to Venice , To make a perfect league , during which timeHe would in private keep some Troops in pay , Bribe all the Centinels throughout this Kingdom , Corrupt the Captains ; at a Banquet poysonThe Prince , and greatest Peers , and in conclusionYield Candy slave to Venice .
Next , he contractedWith the Illustrious Princess , the Lady Erota , In hope of marriage with her , to deliverAll the Venetian gallantry , and strength , Upon their first arrival , to the mercyOf her and Candy .
This is true , Gonzalo .
Let it be true : what then ?
My Lord Ambassadour , What 's your demand ?
As likes the State of Candy , Either to sentence him as he deservesHere , or to send him like a slave to Venice .
We shall advise upon it .
O the Devils , That had not thrust this trick into my pate -- 298 ] A Politician fool ? destruction plague
and Venice both.Possenne Porphycio : Away with him .
Come Sir , I'le see you safe. [ Exeunt Gonz. Mel .
Lords , e 're you partBe witness to another change of wonder ;
, now be bold , before this presence , Freely to speak , whether or no I us'dThe humblest means affection could contrive , To gain thy love .
Madam , I must confess it , And ever am your servant .
Yes Antinous , My servant , for my Lord thou shalt be never : I here disclaim the interest thou hadst onceIn my too passionate thoughts. Most noble Prince , If yet a relique of thy wonted flamesLive warm within thy bosom , then I blush notTo offer up the assurance of my faith , To thee that hast deserv 'd it best .
O Madam , You play with my calamity .
Let heavenRecord my truth for ever .
With more joyThan I have words to utter , I accept it.I also pawn you mine .
The man that in requitalOf noble and un-sought affectionGrows cruel , never lov 'd , nor did Antinous.Yet herein ( Prince ) ye are beholding to him ; For his neglect of me humbled a pride , Which to a vertuous wife had been a Monster .
For which I'le rank him my deserving friend .
Much comfort dwell with you , as I could wishTo him I honour most .
O my Antinous , My own , my own good son .
One suit I have to make .
To whom Fernando ? 299 ]
Lord Cassilane to you .
To me ?
This LadyHath promised to be mine .
Your blessing Sir ; Brother your love .
You can not Sir bestow herOn a more noble Gentleman .
Saist thou so ?
I confirm it. Here Fernando , Live both as one ; she is thine .

***START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FALSE ONE***E-text prepared by Jonathan Ingram , William Flis , and the ProjectGutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading TeamTHE FALSE ONEA Tragedyby Francis Beaumont and John FletcherEdited by Arnold GloverPERSONS REPRESENTED IN THE PLAY.Julius Cæsar , Emperour of Rome.Ptolomy , King of Ægypt.Achoreus , an honest Counsellor , Priest of Isis.Photinus , a Politician , minion to Ptolomy.Achillas , Captain of the Guard to Ptolomy.Septimius , a revolted Roman Villain.Labienus , a Roman Souldier , and Nuncio.Apollodorus , Guardian to Cleopatra.Antonie , ) Dolabella , ) Cæsars Captains.Sceva , a free Speaker , also Captain to Cæsar .
Cleopatra , Queen of Ægypt. Cæsar 's Mistris.Arsino , Cleopatra 's Sister.Eros , Cleopatra 's waiting Woman .
Ægypt.The principal Actors were,
Achillas , and Achoreus. [ Ach. ] I love the King , nor do dispute his power , ( For that is not confin 'd , nor to be censur'dBy me , that am his Subject ) yet allow meThe liberty of a Man , that still would beA friend to Justice , to demand the motivesThat did induce young Ptolomy , or Photinus , ( To whose directions he gives up himself , And I hope wisely ) to commit his Sister , The Princess Cleopatra ( if I saidThe Queen ) Achillas 'twere ( I hope ) no treason , She being by her Fathers Testament ( Whose memory I bow to ) left Co-heirIn all he stood possest of .
'T is confest ( My good Achoreus ) that in these Eastern KingdomsWomen are not exempted from the Sceptre , But claim a priviledge , equal to the Male ; But how much such divisions have ta'en fromThe Majesty of Egypt , and what factionsHave sprung from those partitions , to the ruineOf the poor Subject , ( doubtful which to follow , ) We have too many , and too sad examples , Therefore the wise Photinus , to preventThe Murthers , and the Massacres , that attendOn disunited Government , and to shewThe King without a Partner , in full splendour , Thought it convenient the fair Cleopatra , ( An attribute not frequent to the Climate ) Should be committed in safe Custody , In which she is attended like her Birth , Until her Beauty , or her royal Dowre , Hath found her out a Husband .
How this mayStand with the rules of policy , I know not ; Most sure I am , it holds no correspondenceWith the Rites of Ægypt , or the Laws of Nature ; But grant that Cleopatra can sit downWith this disgrace ( though insupportable ) Can you imagine , that Romes glorious Senate ( To whose charge , by the will of the dead KingThis government was deliver 'd ) or great Pompey , ( That is appointed Cleopatra 's GuardianAs well as Ptolomies ) will e 're approveOf this rash counsel , their consent not sought for , That should authorize it ?
The Civil warIn which the Roman Empire is embarqu'dOn a rough Sea of danger , does exactTheir whole care to preserve themselves , and gives themNo vacant time to think of what we do , Which hardly can concern them .
What 's your opinionOf the success ? I have heard , in multitudesOf Souldiers , and all glorious pomp of war,
is much superiour .
I could give youA Catalogue of all the several NationsFrom whence he drew his powers : but that were tedious.They have rich arms , are ten to one in number , Which makes them think the day already won ; And Pompey being master of the Sea , Such plenty of all delicates are brought in , As if the place on which they are entrench 'd , Were not a Camp of Souldiers , but Rome , In which Lucullus and Apicius joyn 'd , To make a publique Feast : they at DirachiumFought with success ; but knew not to make use of
fair offer : so much I have heard
himself confess .
Where are they now ?
In Thessalie , near the Pharsalian plainsWhere Cæsar with a handfull of his MenHems in the greater number : his whole troopsExceed not twenty thousand , but old SouldiersFlesh 'd in the spoils of Germany and France , Inur 'd to his Command , and only knowTo fight and overcome ; And though that FamineRaigns in his Camp , compelling them to tastBread made of roots , forbid the use of man , ( Which they with scorn threw into Pompeys CampAs in derision of his Delicates ) Or corn not yet half ripe , and that a Banquet : They still besiege him , being ambitious onlyTo come to blows , and let their swords determineWho hath the better Cause .
Septi [ m ] ius .
May VictoryAttend o n't , where it is .
We every hourExpect to hear the issue .
Save my good Lords ; By Isis and Osiris , whom you worship ; And the four hundred gods and goddessesAdor 'd in Rome , I am your honours servant .
Truth needs , Septimius , no oaths .
You are cruel , If you deny him swearing , you take from himThree full parts of his language .
Your Honour 's bitter , Confound me , where I love I can not say it , But I must swear't : yet such is my ill fortune , Nor vows , nor protestations win belief , I think , and ( I can find no other reason ) Because I am a Roman .
No Septimius , To be a Roman were an honour to you , Did not your manners , and your life take from it , And cry aloud , that from Rome you bring nothingBut Roman Vices , which you would plant here , But no seed of her vertues .
With your reverenceI am too old to learn .
Any thing honest , That I believe , without an oath .
I fearYour Lordship has slept ill to night , and thatInvites this sad discourse : 'twill make you oldBefore your time : -- O these vertuous Morals , And old religious principles , that fool us ! I have brought you a new Song , will make you laugh , Though you were at your prayers .
What is the subject ? Be free Septimius .
'T is a CatalogueOf all the Gamesters of the Court and City , Which Lord lyes with that Lady , and what GallantSports with that Merchants wife ; and does relateWho sells her honour for a Diamond , Who , for a tissew robe : whose husband 's jealous , And who so kind , that , to share with his wife , Will make the match himself : Harmless conceits , Though fools say they are dangerous : I sang itThe last night at my Lord Photinus table .
How ? as a Fidler ?
No Sir , as a Guest , A welcom guest too : and it was approv 'd ofBy a dozen of his friends , though they were touch 'd i n't : For look you , 't is a kind of merriment , When we have laid by foolish modesty ( As not a man of fashion will wear it ) To talk what we have done ; at least to hear it ; If meerily set down , it fires the blood , And heightens Crest-faln appetite .
New doctrine !
Was't of your own composing ?
No , I bought itOf a skulking Scribler for two Ptolomies : But the hints were mine own ; the wretch was fearfull : But I have damn 'd my self , should it be question 'd , That I will own it .
And be punished for it : Take heed : for you may so long exerciseYour scurrilous wit against authority , The Kingdoms Counsels ; and make profane Jests , ( Which to you ( being an atheist ) is nothing ) Against Religion , that your great maintainers ( Unless they would be thought Co-partners with you ) Will leave you to the Law : and then , Septimius , Remember there are whips .
For whore 's I grant you , When they are out of date , till then are safe too , Or all the Gallants of the Court are Eunuchs , And for mine own defence I'le only add this , I'le be admitted for a wanton taleTo some most private Cabinets , when your Priest-hood ( Though laden with the mysteries of your goddess ) Shall wait without unnoted : so I leave youTo your pious thoughts. [ Exit .
'T is a strange impudence , This fellow does put on .
The wonder great , He is accepted of .
Vices , for him , Make as free way as vertues doe for others.'Tis the times fault : yet Great ones still have grace'dTo make them sport , or rub them o 're with flattery , Observers of all kinds .
Photinus , and Septimius .
No more of him , He is not worth our thoughts : a FugitiveFrom Pompeys army : and now in a dangerWhen he should use his service .
See how he hangsOn great Photinus Ear .
Hell , and the furies , And all the plagues of darkness light upon me : You are my god on earth : and let me haveYour favour here , fall what can fall hereafter .
Thou art believ 'd : dost thou want mony ?
No Sir .
Or hast thou any suite ? these ever followThy vehement protestations .
You much wrong me ; How can I want , when your beams shine upon me , Unless employment to express my zealTo do your greatness service ? do but thinkA deed so dark , the Sun would blush to look on , For which Man-kind would curse me , and arm allThe powers above , and those below against me : Command me , I will on .
When I have use , I'le put you to the test .
May it be speedy , And something worth my danger : you are cold , And know not your own powers : this brow was fashion'dTo wear a Kingly wreath , and your grave judgment , Given to dispose of monarchies , not to governA childs affairs , the peoples eye 's upon you , The Souldier courts you : will you wear a garmentOf sordid loyalty when 't is out of fashion ?
When Pompey was thy General , Septimius , Thou saidst as much to him .
All my love to him , To Cæsar , Rome , and the whole world is lostIn the Ocean of your Bounties : I have no friend , Project , design , or Countrey , but your favour , Which I'le preserve at any rate .
No more ; When I call on you , fall not off : perhapsSooner than you expect , I may employ you , So leave me for a while .
Ever your Creature. [ Exit .
Good day Achoreus ; my best friend Achillas , Hath fame deliver 'd yet no certain rumourOf the great Roman Action ?
That we areTo enquire , and learn of you Sir : whose grave careFor Egypts happiness , and great Ptolomies good , Hath eyes and ears in all parts .
Ptolomy , Labienus , Guard .
I'le not boast , What my Intelligence costs me : but 'ere longYou shall know more. The King , with him a Roman .
The scarlet livery of unfortunate warDy 'd deeply on his face .
'T is Labienus
Lieutenant in the wars of Gaul , And fortunate in all his undertakings : But since these Civil jars he turn 'd to Pompey , And though he followed the better CauseNot with the like success .
Such as are wiseLeave falling buildings , flye to those that rise ; But more of that hereafter .
The reason Labienus ?
To say I grieve his fortuneAs much as if the Crown I wear ( his gift ) Were ravish 'd from me , is a holy truth , Our Gods can witness for me : yet , being young , And not a free disposer of my self ; Let not a few hours , borrowed for advice , Beget suspicion of unthankfulness , ( Which next to Hell I hate ) pray you retire , And take a little rest , and let his woundsBe with that care attended , as they wereCarv 'd on my flesh : good Labienus , thinkThe little respite , I desire shall beWholly emploi 'd to find the readiest wayTo doe great Pompey service .
May the gods ( As you intend ) protect you. [ Exit .
Sit : sit all , It is my pleasure : your advice , and freely .
A short deliberation in this , May serve to give you counsel : to be honest , Religious and thankfull , in themselvesAre forcible motives , and can need no flourishOr gloss in the perswader ; your kept faith , ( Though Pompey never rise to th ' height he 's fallen from )
himself will love ; and my opinionIs ( still committing it to graver censure ) You pay the debt you owe him , with the hazardOf all you can call yours .
What 's yours , ( Photinus ? )
Achoreus ( great Ptolomy ) hath counsell'dLike a Religious , and honest man , Worthy the honour that he justly holdsIn being Priest to Isis : But alas , What in a man , sequester 'd from the world , Or in a private person , is prefer 'd , No policy allows of in a King , To be or just , or thankfull , makes Kings guilty , And faith ( though prais 'd ) is punish 'd that supportsSuch as good Fate forsakes : joyn with the gods , Observe the man they favour , leave the wretched , The Stars are not more distant from the EarthThan profit is from honesty ; all the power , Prerogative , and greatness of a PrinceIs lost , if he descend once but to steerHis course , as what 's right , guides him : let him leaveThe Scepter , that strives only to be good , Since Kingdomes are maintain 'd by force and blood .
Oh wicked !
Peace : goe on .
Great Osiris , Defend thy Ægypt from such cruelty , And barbarous ingratitude !
Holy trifles , And not to have place in designs of State ; This sword , which Fate commands me to unsheath , I would not draw on Pompey , if not vanquish'd.I grant it rather should have pass 'd through Cæsar , But we must follow where his fortune leads us ; All provident Princes measure their intentsAccording to their power , and so dispose them : And thinkst thou ( Ptolomy ) that thou canst propHis Ruines , under whom sad Rome now suffers ? Or 'tempt the Conquerours force when 't is confirm 'd ? Shall we , that in the Battail sate as NeutersServe him that 's overcome ? No , no , he 's lost.And though 't is noble to a sinking friendTo lend a helping hand , while there is hopeHe may recover , thy part not engag'dThough one most dear , when all his hopes are dead , To drown him , set thy foot upon his head .
Most execrable Counsel .
To be follow 'd , 'T is for the Kingdoms safety .
We give upOur absolute power to thee : dispose of itAs reason shall direct thee .
Good Achillas , Seek out Septimius : do you but sooth him , He is already wrought : leave the dispatchTo me of Labienus : 't is determin'dAlready how you shall proceed : nor FateShall alter it , since now the dye is cast , But that this hour to Pompey is his last. [ Exit.SCENA II .
Apollodorus , Eros , Arsino .
Is the Queen stirring , Eros ?
Yes , for in truthShe touch 'd no bed to night .
I am sorry for it , And wish it were in me , with my hazard , To give her ease .
Sir , she accepts your will , And does acknowledge she hath found you noble , So far , as if restraint of libertyCould give admission to a thought of mirth , She is your debtor for it .
Did you tell herOf the sports I have prepar 'd to entertain her ? She was us 'd to take delight , with her fair hand , To angle in the Nile , where the glad fish ( As if they knew who 't was sought to deceive 'em ) Contended to be taken : other timesTo strike the Stag , who wounded by her arrows , Forgot his tears in death , and kneeling thanks herTo his last gasp , then prouder of his Fate , Than if with Garlands Crown 'd , he had been chosenTo fall a Sacrifice before the altarOf the Virgin Huntress : the King , nor great PhotinusForbid her any pleasure ; and the CircuitIn which she is confin 'd , gladly affordsVariety of pastimes , which I wouldEncrease with my best service .
O , but the thoughtThat she that was born free , and to dispenseRestraint , or liberty to others , should beAt the devotion of her Brother , whomShe only knows her equal , makes this placeIn which she lives ( though stor 'd with all delights ) A loathsome dungeon to her .
Yet , ( howe'reShe shall interpret it ) I'le not be wantingTo do my best to serve her : I have prepar'dChoise Musick near her Cabinet , and compos'dSome few lines , ( set unto a solemn time ) In the praise of imprisonment. Begin Boy.THE SONG .
Cleopatra .
But that we are assur 'd this tastes of duty , And love in you , my Guardian , and desireIn you , my Sister , and the rest , to please us , We should receive this , as a sawcy rudenessOffer 'd our private thoughts. But your intentsAre to delight us : alas , you wash an Ethiop : Can Cleopatra , while she does rememberWhose Daughter she is , and whose Sister ? ( OI suffer in the name ) and that ( in Justice ) There is no place in Ægypt , where I stand , But that the tributary Earth is proudTo kiss the foot of her , that is her Queen , Can she , I say , that is all this , e 're relishOf comfort , or delight , while base Photinus , Bond-man Achillas , and all other monstersThat raign o 're Ptolomy , make that a Court , Where they reside , and this , where I , a Prison ? But there 's a Rome , a Senate , and a Cæsar , ( Though the great Pompey lean to Ptolomy ) May think of Cleopatra .
Pompey , Madam ?
What of him ? speak : if ill , Apollodorus , It is my happiness : and for thy newsReceive a favour ( Kings have kneel 'd in vain for ) And kiss my hand .
He 's lost .
Speak it again !
His army routed : he fled and pursu'dBy the all-conquering Cæsar .
Whither bends he ?
To Egypt .
Ha ! in person ?
'T is receiv'dFor an undoubted truth .
I live again , And if assurance of my love , and beautyDeceive me not , I now shall find a JudgeTo do me right : but how to free my self , And get access ? the Guards are strong upon me , This door I must pass through. Apollodorus , Thou often hast profess 'd ( to do me service , ) Thy life was not thine own .
I am not alter 'd ; And let your excellency propound a means , In which I may but give the least assistance , That may restore you , to that you were born to , ( Though it call on the anger of the King , Or , ( what 's more deadly ) all his Minion
can do to me ) I , unmov 'd , Offer my throat to serve you : ever provided , It bear some probable shew to be effected.To lose my self upon no ground , were madness , Not loyal duty .
Stand off : to thee alone , I will discover what I dare not trustMy Sister with , Cæsar is amorous , And taken more with the title of a Queen , Than feature or proportion , he lov 'd Eunoe , A Moor , deformed too , I have heard , that broughtNo other object to inflame his blood , But that her Husband was a King , on bothHe did bestow rich presents ; shall I then , That with a princely birth , bring beauty with me , That know to prize my self at mine own rate , Despair his favour ? art thou mine ?
I am .
I have found out a way shall bring me to him , Spight of Photinus watches ; if I prosper , ( As I am confident I shall ) expectThings greater than thy wishes ; though I purchaseHis grace with loss of my virginity , It skills not , if it bring home Majesty. [ Exeunt .
Septimius , with a head , Achillas , Guard .
'T is here , 't is done , behold you fearfull viewers , Shake , and behold the model of the world here , The pride , and strength , look , look again , 't is finish 'd ; That , that whole Armies , nay whole nations , Many and mighty Kings , have been struck blind at , And fled before , wing 'd with their fears and terrours , That steel war waited on , and fortune courted , That high plum 'd honour built up for her own ; Behold that mightiness , behold that fierceness , Behold that child of war , with all his glories ; By this poor hand made breathless , here ( my Achillas )
, and Cæsar , owe me for this service , And all the conquer 'd Nations .
Peace Septimius , Thy words sound more ungratefull than thy actions , Though sometimes safety seek an instrumentOf thy unworthy nature , thou ( loud boaster ) Think not she is bound to love him too , that 's barbarous.Why did not I , if this be meritorious , And binds the King unto me , and his bounties , Strike this rude stroke ? I'le tell thee ( thou poor Roman ) It was a sacred head , I durst not heave at , Not heave a thought .
It was .
I'le tell thee truely , And if thou ever yet heard'st tell of honour , I'le make thee blush : It was thy General 's ; That mans that fed thee once , that mans that bred thee , The air thou breath'dst was his ; the fire that warm 'd thee , From his care kindled ever , nay , I'le show thee , ( Because I'le make thee sensible of the business , And why a noble man durst not touch at it ) There was no piece of Earth , thou putst thy foot onBut was his conquest ; and he gave thee motion.He triumph 'd three times , who durst touch his person ? The very walls of Rome bow 'd to his presence , Dear to the Gods he was , to them that fear 'd himA fair and noble Enemy. Didst thou hate him ? And for thy love to Cæsar , sought his ruine ? Arm 'd in the red Pharsalian fields , Septimius , Where killing was in grace , and wounds were glorious , Where Kings were fair competitours for honour , Thou shouldst have come up to him , there have fought him , There , Sword to Sword .
I kill 'd him on commandment , If Kings commands be fair , when you all fainted , When none of you durst look --
On deeds so barbarous , What hast thou got ?
The Kings love , and his bounty , The honour of the service , which though you rail at , Or a thousand envious souls fling their foams on me , Will dignifie the cause , and make me glorious : And I shall live .
A miserable villain , What reputation , and reward belongs to itThus ( with the head ) I seize on , and make mine ; And be not impudent to ask me why , Sirrah , Nor bold to stay , read in mine eyes the reason : The shame and obloquy I leave thine own , Inherit those rewards , they are fitter for thee , Your oyl 's spent , and your snuff stinks : go out basely. [ Exit .
The King will yet consider .
Ptolomy , Achoreus , Photinus .
Here he comes Sir .
Yet if it be undone : hear me great Sir , If this inhumane stroak be yet unstrucken , If that adored head be not yet sever'dFrom the most noble Body , weigh the miseries , The desolations that this great Eclipse works , You are young , be provident : fix not your EmpireUpon the Tomb of him will shake all Egypt , Whose warlike groans will raise ten thousand Spirits , ( Great as himself ) in every hand a thunder ; Destructions darting from their looks , and sorrowsThat easy womens eyes shall never empty .
You have done well ; and 't is done , see Achillas , And in his hand the head .
Stay come no nearer , Me thinks I feel the very earth shake under me , I do remember him , he was my guardian , Appointed by the Senate to preserve me : What a full Majesty sits in his face yet ?
The King is troubled : be not frighted Sir , Be not abus 'd with fears ; his death was necessary , If you consider , Sir , most necessary , Not to be miss 'd : and humbly thank great Isis , He came so opportunely to your hands ; Pity must now give place to rules of safety.Is not victorious Cæsar new arriv 'd , And enter 'd Alexandria , with his friends , His Navy riding by to wait his charges ? Did he not beat this Pompey , and pursu 'd him ? Was not this great man , his great enemy ? This Godlike vertuous man , as people held him , But what fool dare be friend to flying vertue ?
Cæsar , Anthony , Dolabella , Sceva.I hear their Trumpets , 't is too late to stagger , Give me the head , and be you confident : Hail Conquerour , and head of all the world , Now this head 's off .
Ha ?
Do not shun me , Cæsar , From kingly Ptolomy I bring this present , The Crown , and sweat of thy Pharsalian labour : The goal and mark of high ambitious honour.Before thy victory had no name , Cæsar , Thy travel and thy loss of blood , no recompence , Thou dreamst of being worthy , and of war ; And all thy furious conflicts were but slumbers , Here they take life : here they inherit honour , Grow fixt , and shoot up everlasting triumphs : Take it , and look upon thy humble servant , With noble eyes look on the Princely Ptolomy , That offers with this head ( most mighty Cæsar ) What thou would'st once have given for it , all Egypt .
Nor do not question it ( most royal Conquerour ) Nor dis-esteem the benefit that meets thee , Because 't is easily got , it comes the safer : Yet let me tell thee ( most imperious Cæsar ) Though he oppos 'd no strength of Swords to win this , Nor labour 'd through no showres of darts , and lances : Yet here he found a fort , that faced him strongly , An inward war : he was his Grand-sires Guest ; Friend to his Father , and when he was expell'dAnd beaten from this Kingdom by strong hand , And had none left him , to restore his honour , No hope to find a friend , in such a misery ; Then in stept Pompey ; took his feeble fortune : Strengthen 'd , and cherish 'd it , and set it right again , This was a love to Cæsar .
Give me , hate , Gods .
This Cæsar may account a little wicked , But yet remember , if thine own hands , Conquerour , Had fallen upon him , what it had been then ? If thine own sword had touch 'd his throat , what that way ! He was thy Son in Law , there to be tainted , Had been most terrible : let the worst be render 'd , We have deserv 'd for keeping thy hands innocent .
Oh Sceva , Sceva , see that head : see Captains , The head of godlike Pompey .
He was basely ruin 'd , But let the Gods be griev 'd that suffer 'd it , And be you Cæsar --
Oh thou Conquerour , Thou glory of the world once , now the pity : Thou awe of Nations , wherefore didst thou fall thus ? What poor fate follow 'd thee , and pluckt thee onTo trust thy sacred life to an Egyptian ; The life and light of Rome , to a blind stranger , That honorable war ne'r taught a nobleness , Nor worthy circumstance shew 'd what a man was , That never heard thy name sung , but in banquets ; And loose lascivious pleasures ? to a Boy , That had no faith to comprehend thy greatness , No study of thy life to know thy goodness ; And leave thy Nation , nay , thy noble friend , Leave him ( distrusted ) that in tears falls with thee ? ( In soft relenting tears ) hear me ( great Pompey ) ( If thy great spirit can hear ) I must task thee : Thou hast most unnobly rob 'd me of my victory , My love , and mercy .
O how brave these tears shew ! How excellent is sorrow in an Enemy !
Glory appears not greater than this goodness .
Egyptians , dare you think your high Pyramides , Built to out-dare the Sun , as you suppose , Where your unworthy Kings lye rak 'd in ashes , Are monuments fit for him ? no , ( brood of Nilus ) Nothing can cover his high fame , but Heaven ; No Pyramides set off his memories , But the eternal substance of his greatnessTo which I leave him : take the head away , And ( with the body ) give it noble burial , Your Earth shall now be bless 'd to hold a Roman , Whose braverys all the worlds-Earth can not ballance .
If thou bee'st thus loving , I shall honour thee , But great men may dissemble , 't is held possible , And be right glad of what they seem to weep for , There are such kind of Philosophers ; now do I wonderHow he would look if Pompey were alive again , But how he would set his face ?
You look now , King , And you that have been Agents in this glory , For our especial favour ?
We desire it .
And doubtless you expect rewards .
Let me give 'em : I'le give 'em such as nature never dreamt of , I'le beat him and his Agents ( in a morter ) Into one man , and that one man I'le bake then .
Peace : I forgive you all , that 's recompence : You are young , and ignorant , that pleads your pardon , And fear it may be more than hate provok 'd ye , Your Ministers , I must think , wanted judgment , And so they err 'd : I am bountiful to think this ; Believe me most bountiful ; be you most thankful , That bounty share amongst ye : if I knewWhat to send you for a present , King of Egypt , ( I mean a head of equal reputationAnd that you lov 'd ) though it were your brightest Sisters , ( But her you hate ) I would not be behind ye .
Hear me , ( Great Cæsar . )
We will do all .
You have rob 'd him of those tearsHis Kindred and his Friends kept sacred for him ; The Virgins of their Funeral Lamentations : And that kind Earth that thought to cover him , ( His Countries Earth ) will cry out 'gainst your Cruelty , And weep unto the Ocean for revenge , Till Nilus raise his seven heads and devour ye ; My grief has stopt the rest : when Pompey liv'dHe us 'd you nobly , now he is dead use him so. [ Exit .
Now , where 's your confidence ? your aim ( Photinus ) The Oracles , and fair Favours from the ConquerourYou rung into mine Ears ? how stand I now ? You see the tempest of his stern displeasure , The death of him you urged a SacrificeTo stop his Rage , presaging a full ruine ; Where are your Counsels now ?
I told you , Sir , ( And told the truth ) what danger would flye after ; And though an Enemy , I satisfied youHe was a Roman , and the top of Honour ; And howsoever this might please Great Cæsar , I told ye that the foulness of his Death , The impious baseness --
Peace , you are a Fool , Men of deep ends must tread as deep ways to 'em ;
I know is pleas 'd , and for all his sorrows ( Which are put on for forms and meer dissemblings ) I am confident he 's glad ; to have told ye so , And thank ye outwardly , had been too open , And taken from the Wisedom of a Conquerour.Be confident and proud ye have done this service ; Ye have deserv 'd , and ye will find it highly : Make bold use of this benefit , and be sureYou keep your Sister , ( the high-soul 'd Cleopatra ) Both close and short enough , she may not see him ; The rest , if I may counsel , Sir --
Do all ; For in thy faithful service rests my safety. [ Exeunt.SCENE II .
Septimius .
Here 's a strange alteration in the Court ; Mens Faces are of other setts and motions , Their minds of subtler stuff ; I pass by nowAs though I were a Rascal , no man knows me , No Eye looks after ; as I were a PlagueTheir doors shut close against me ; and I wondred atBecause I have done a meritorious Murther ; Because I have pleas 'd the Time , does the Time plague me ? I have known the day they would have hug 'd me for it , For a less stroke than this have done me Reverence ; Open 'd their Hearts and secret Closets to me , Their Purses , and their Pleasures , and bid me wallow.I now perceive the great Thieves eat the less , And the huge Leviathans of VillanySup up the merits , nay the men and allThat do them service , and spowt 'em out againInto the air , as thin and unregardedAs drops of Water that are lost i'th ' Ocean : I was lov 'd once for swearing , and for drinking , And for other principal Qualities that became me , Now a foolish unthankful Murther has undone me , If my Lord Photinus be not merciful
Photinus.That set me on ; And he comes , now Fortune .
Cæsars unthankfulness a little stirs me , A little frets my bloud ; take heed , proud Roman , Provoke me not , stir not mine anger farther ; I may find out a way unto thy life too , ( Though arm 'd in all thy Victories ) and seize it.A Conquerour has a heart , and I may hit it .
May it please your Lordship ?
O Septimius !
Your [ Lordship ] knows my wrongs .
Wrongs ?
Yes , my Lord , How the Captain of the Guard , Achillas , slights me .
Think better of him , he has much befriended thee , Shew 'd thee much love in taking the head from thee.The times are alter 'd ( Souldier ) Cæsar 's angry , And our design to please him lost and perish 'd ; Be glad thou art unnam 'd , 't is not worth the owning ; Yet , that thou maist be useful --
Yes , my Lord , I shall be ready .
For I may employ theeTo take a rub or two out of my way , As time shall serve , say that it be a Brother ? Or a hard Father ?
'T is most necessary , A Mother , or a Sister , or whom you please , Sir .
Or to betray a noble Friend ?
'T is all one .
I know thou wilt stir for Gold .
'T is all my motion .
There , take that for thy service , and farewel ; I have greater business now .
I am still your own , Sir .
One thing I charge thee , see me no more , Septimius , Unless I send. [ Exit .
I shall observe your hour.So , this brings something in the mouth , some savour ; This is the Lord I serve , the Power I worship , My Friends , Allies , and here lies my Allegiance.Let People talk as they please of my rudeness , And shun me for my deed ; bring but this to 'em , ( Let me be damn 'd for blood ) yet still I am honourable , This God creates new tongues , and new affections ; And though I had kill 'd my Father , give me GoldI 'll make men swear I have done a pious Sacrifice ; Now I will out-brave all ; make all my Servants , And my brave deed shall be writ in Wine , for vertuous. [ Exit.SCENE III .
Cæsar , Antony , Dolabella , Sceva .
Keep strong Guards , and with wary eyes ( my friends ) There is no trusting to these base Egyptians ; They that are false to pious benefits , And make compell 'd necessities their faithsAre Traitors to the gods .
We 'll call ashoreA Legion of the best .
Not a Man , Antony , That were to shew our fears , and dim our greatness : No , 't is enough my Name 's ashore .
Too much too , A sleeping Cæsar is enough to shake them ; There are some two or three malicious RascalsTrain 'd up in Villany , besides that CerberusThat Roman Dog , that lick 'd the blood of Pompey .
'T is strange , a Roman Souldier ?
You are cozen 'd , There be of us as be of all other Nations , Villains , and Knaves ; 't is not the name contains him , But the obedience ; when that 's once forgotten , And Duty flung away , then welcome Devil .
and Achillas , and this VermineThat 's now become a natural CrocodileMust be with care observ 'd .
And 't is well counsel'dNo Confidence , nor trust --
I 'll trust the Sea first , When with her hollow murmurs she invites me , And clutches in her storms , as politick LionsConceal their Claws ; I 'll trust the Devil first .
Go to your rests , and follow your own Wisedoms , And leave me to my thoughts : pray no more complement , Once more strong Watches .
All shall be observ 'd , Sir. [ Exit .
I am dull and heavy , yet I can not sleep , How happy was I in my lawful Wars , In Germany , and Gaul , and BritannyWhen every night with pleasure I set downWhat the day ministred ! The sleep came sweetly : But since I undertook this home-division , This civil War , and past the Rubicon ; What have I done that speaks an ancient Roman ? A good , great man ? I have enter 'd Rome by force , And on her tender Womb ( that gave me life ) Let my insulting Souldiers rudely trample , The dear Veins of my Country I have open 'd , And sail 'd upon the torrents that flow 'd from her , The bloody streams that in their confluenceCarried before 'em thousand desolations ; I rob 'd the Treasury , and at one gripeSnatch 'd all the wealth , so many worthy triumphsPlac 'd there as sacred to the Peace of Rome ; I raz 'd Massilia , in my wanton anger:
and Afranius I defeated:
I overthrew : what did that get me ? The slubber 'd Name of an authoriz 'd Enemy. [ Noise within.I hear some Noise ; they are the Watches sure.What Friends have I ty 'd fast by these ambitions ?
, the Lover of his Countries freedom , Is now past into Africk to affront me,
( that kill 'd my friend ) is up in Arms too ; The Sons of Pompey are Masters of the Sea , And from the reliques of their scatter 'd faction , A new head 's sprung ; Say I defeat all these too ; I come home crown 'd an honourable Rebel.I hear the Noise still , and it still comes nearer ; Are the Guards fast ? Who waits there ?
Sceva with a Packet , Cleopatra in it .
Are ye awake Sir ?
I'th ' name of Wonder .
Nay , I am a Porter , A strong one too , or else my sides would crack , Sir , And my sins were as weighty , I should scarce walk with 'em .
What hast thou there ?
Ask them which stay without , And brought it hither , your Presence I deny 'd 'em , And put 'em by ; took up the load my self , They say 't is rich , and valu 'd at the Kingdome , I am sure 't is heavy ; if you like to see itYou may : if not , I 'll give it back .
Stay Sceva , I would fain see it .
I 'll begin to work then ; No doubt , to flatter ye they have sent ye something , Of a rich value , Jewels , or some rich Treasure ; May be a Rogue within to do a mischief ; I pray you stand farther off , if there be villany , Better my danger first ; he shall 'scape hard too , Ha ! what art thou ?
Stand farther off , good Sceva , What heavenly Vision ! do I wake or slumber ? Farther off that hand , Friend .
What Apparition ? What Spirit have I rais 'd ? sure 't is a Woman , She looks like one ; now she begins to move too : A tempting Devil , o ' my life ; go off , Cæsar , Bless thy self , off : a Bawd grown in mine old days ? Bawdry advanc 'd upon my back ? 't is noble : Sir , if you be a Souldier come no nearer , She is sent to dispossess you of your honour , A Spunge , a Spunge to wipe away your Victories : And she would be cool 'd , Sir , let the Souldiers trim her ! They 'll give her that she came for , and dispatch her ; Be loyal to your self. Thou damned Woman , Dost thou come hither with thy flourishes , Thy flaunts , and faces to abuse mens manners ? And am I made the instrument of Bawdry ? I 'll find a Lover for ye , one that shall hug ye .
Hold , on thy life , and be more temperate , Thou Beast .
Thou Beast ?
Could'st thou be so inhumane , So far from noble Men , to draw thy WeaponUpon a thing divine ?
Divine , or humane , They are never better pleas 'd , nor more at hearts ease , Than when we draw with full intent upon 'em .
Move this way ( Lady ) 'Pray ye let me speak to ye .
And Woman , you had best stand .
By the gods , But that I see her here , and hope her mortal , I should imagine some celestial sweetness , The treasure of soft love .
Oh , this sounds mangily , Poorly , and scurvily in a Souldiers mouth : You had best be troubled with the Tooth-ach too , For Lovers ever are , and let your Nose dropThat your celestial Beauty may befriend ye ; At these years do you learn to be fantastical ? After so many bloody fields , a Fool ? She brings her Bed along too , she 'll lose no time , Carries her Litter to lye soft , do you see that ? Invites ye like a Gamester : note that impudence , For shame reflect upon your self , your honour , Look back into your noble parts , and blush : Let not the dear sweat of the hot Pharsalia , Mingle with base Embraces ; am I heThat have receiv 'd so many wounds for Cæsar ? Upon my Target groves of darts still growing ? Have I endur 'd all hungers , colds , distresses , And ( as I had been bred that Iron that arm 'd me ) Stood out all weathers , now to curse my fortune ? To ban the blood I lost for such a General ?
Offend no more : be gone .
I will , and leave ye , Leave ye to womens wars , that will proclaim ye : You'l conquer Rome now , and the CapitolWith Fans , and Looking-glasses , farewel Cæsar .
Now I am private Sir , I dare speak to ye : But thus low first , for as a God I honour ye .
Lower you'l be anon .
Away .
And privater , For that you covet all. [ Exit .
Tempt me no farther .
Contemn me not , because I kneel thus , Cæsar , I am a Queen , and coheir to this country , The Sister to the mighty Ptolomy , Yet one distress 'd , that flyes unto thy justice , One that layes sacred hold on thy protectionAs on an holy Altar , to preserve me .
Speak Queen of beauty , and stand up .
I dare not , 'Till I have found that favour in thine eyes , That godlike great humanity to help me , Thus , to thy knees must I grow ( sacred Cæsar , ) And if it be not in thy will , to right me , And raise me like a Queen from my sad ruines , If these soft tears can not sink to thy pity , And waken with their murmurs thy compassions ; Yet for thy nobleness , for vertues sake , And if thou beest a man , for despis 'd beauty , For honourable conquest , which thou doat'st on , Let not those cankers of this flourishing Kingdom,
, and Achillas , ( the one an Eunuch , The other a base bondman ) thus raign over me.Seize my inheritance , and leave my BrotherNothing of what he should be , but the Title , As thou art wonder of the world .
Stand up thenAnd be a Queen , this hand shall give it to ye , Or choose a greater name , worthy my bounty : A common love makes Queens : choose to be worshipped , To be divinely great , and I dare promise it ; A suitor of your sort , and blessed sweetness , That hath adventur 'd thus to see great Cæsar , Must never be denied , you have found a patronThat dare not in his private honour sufferSo great a blemish to the Heaven of beauty : The God of love would clap his angry wings , And from his singing bow let flye those arrowsHeaded with burning griefs , and pining sorrows , Should I neglect your cause , would make me monstrous , To whom and to your service I devote me .
Sceva .
He is my conquest now , and so I'le work him , The conquerour of the world will I lead captive .
Still with this woman ? tilting still with Babies ? As you are honest think the Enemy , Some valiant Foe indeed now charging on ye : Ready to break your ranks , and fling these --
Hear me , But tell me true , if thou hadst such a treasure , ( And as thou art a Souldier , do not flatter me ) Such a bright gem , brought to thee , wouldst thou notMost greedily accept ?
Not as an Emperour , A man that first should rule himself , then others ; As a poor hungry Souldier , I might bite , Sir , Yet that 's a weakness too : hear me , thou Tempter : And hear thou Cæsar too , for it concerns thee , And if thy flesh be deaf , yet let thine honour , The soul of a commander , give ear to me , Thou wanton bane of war , thou guilded Lethargy , In whose embraces , ease ( the rust of Arms ) And pleasure , ( that makes Souldiers poor ) inhabites .
Fye , thou blasphem'st .
I do , when she is a goddess.Thou melter of strong minds , dar'st thou presumeTo smother all his triumphs , with thy vanities , And tye him like a slave , to thy proud beauties ? To thy imperious looks ? that Kings have follow'dProud of their chains ? have waited on ? I shame Sir. [ Exit .
Alas thou art rather mad : take thy rest Sceva , Thy duty makes thee erre , but I forgive thee : Go , go I say , shew me no disobedience : 'T is well , farewel , the day will break dear Lady , My Souldiers will come in ; please you retire , And think upon your servant .
Pray you Sir , know me , And what I am .
The greater , I more love ye , And you must know me too .
So far as modesty , And majesty gives leave Sir , ye are too violent .
You are too cold to my desires .
Swear to me , And by your self ( for I hold that oath sacred ) You will right me as a Queen --
These lips be witness , And if I break that oath --
You make me blush Sir , And in that blush interpret me .
I will do , Come let 's go in , and blush again : this one word , You shall believe .
I must , you are a conquerour. [ Exeunt.ACTUS TERTIUS. SCENA PRIMA .
Ptolomy , Photinus .
Good Sir , but hear .
No more , you have undone me , That , that I hourly fear 'd , is fain upon me , And heavily , and deadly .
Hear a remedy .
A remedy now the disease is ulcerous ? And has infected all ? your secure negligenceHas broke through all the hopes I have , and ruin 'd me : My Sister is with Cæsar , in his chamber , All night she has been with him ; and no doubtMuch to her honour .
Would that were the worst , Sir , That will repair it self : but I fear mainly , She has made her peace with Cæsar .
'T is most likely , And what am I then ?
'Plague upon that Rascal
, under whose command , Under whose eye --
Achillas .
Curse on you all , ye are wretches .
'T was providently done , Achillas .
Pardon me .
Your guards were rarely wise , and wondrous watchfull .
I could not help it , if my life had lain for't , Alas , who would suspect a pack of bedding , Or a small Truss of houshold furniture ? And as they said , for Cæsars use : or who durst ( Being for his private chamber ) seek to stop it ? I was abus 'd .
Achoreus .
'T is no hour now for anger : No wisdom to debate with fruitless choler , Let us consider timely what we must do , Since she is flown to his protection , From whom we have no power to sever her , Nor force conditions --
Speak ( good Achoreus )
Let indirect and crooked counsels vanish , And straight , and fair directions --
Speak your mind Sir .
Let us choose Cæsar , ( and endear him to us , ) An Arbitrator in all differencesBetwixt you , and your Sister ; this is safe now : And will shew off , most honourable .
Base , Most base and poor ; a servile , cold submission : Hear me , and pluck your hearts up , like stout Counsellours , Since we are sensible this Cæsar loathes us , And have begun our fortune with great Pompey , Be of my mind .
'T is most uncomely spoken , And if I say most bloodily , I lye not : The law of hospitality it poysons , And calls the Gods in question that dwell in us , Be wise O King .
I will be : go my counsellour , To Cæsar go , and do my humble service : To my fair Sister my commends negotiate , And here I ratifie what e 're thou treat'st on .
Crown 'd with fair peace , I go. [ Exit .
My love go with thee , And from my love go you , you cruel vipers : You shall know now I am no ward , Photinus. [ Exit .
This for our service ? Princes do their pleasures , And they that serve obey in all disgraces : The lowest we can fall to , is our graves , There we shall know no diffrence : heark Achillas , I may do something yet , when times are ripe , To tell this raw unthankful ! King .

Thou lov'st me and I thank thee. [ Exeunt.SCENA II .
Antony , Dolabella , Sceva .
Nay there 's no rowsing him : he is bewitch 'd sure , His noble blood curdled , and cold within him ; Grown now a womans warriour .
And a tall one : Studies her fortifications , and her breaches , And how he may advance his ram to batterThe Bullwork of her chastitie .
Be not too angry , For by this light , the woman 's a rare woman , A Lady of that catching youth , and beauty , That unmatch 'd sweetness --
But why should he be fool 'd so ? Let her be what she will , why should his wisdom , His age , and honour --
Say it were your own case , Or mine , or any mans , that has heat in him : 'T is true at this time when he has no promiseOf more security than his sword can cut through , I do not hold it so discreet : but a good face , Gentlemen , And eyes that are the winningst Orators : A youth that opens like perpetual spring , And to all these , a tongue that can deliverThe Oracles of Love --
I would you had her , With all her Oracles , and Miracles , She were fitter for your turn .
Would I had , Sceva , With all her faults too : let me alone to mend 'em , O'that condition I made thee mine heir .
I had rather have your black horse , than your harlots .
Cæsar writes Sonnetts now , the sound of warIs grown too boystrous for his mouth : he sighs too .
And learns to fiddle most melodiously , And sings , 'twould make your ears prick up , to hear him Gent.Shortly she'l make him spin : and 't is thoughtHe will prove an admirable maker of Bonelace , And what a rare gift will that be in a General !
I would he could abstain .
She is a witch sure , And works upon him with some damn 'd inchantment .
How cunning she will carry her behaviours , And set her countenance in a thousand postures , To catch her ends !
She will be sick , well , sullen , Merry , coy , over-joy 'd , and seem to dyeAll in one half hour , to make an asse of him : I make no doubt she will be drunk too damnably , And in her drink will fight , then she fits him .
That thou shouldst bring her in !
'T was my blind fortune , My Souldiers told me , by the weight 't was wicked : Would I had carried Milo 's Bull a furlong , When I brought in this Cow-Calf : he has advanced meFrom an old Souldier , to a bawd of memory : O , that the Sons of Pompey were behind him , The honour 'd Cato , and fierce Juba with 'em , That they might whip him from his whore , and rowze him : That their fierce Trumpets , from his wanton trances , Might shake him like an Earth-quake .
Septimius .
What 's this fellow ?
Why , a brave fellow , if we judge men by their clothes .
By my faith he is brave indeed : he 's no commander ?
Yes , he has a Roman face , he has been at fair warsAnd plenteous too , and rich , his Trappings shew it .
And they will not know me now , they'l never know me.Who dare blush now at my acquaintance ? ha ? Am I not totally a span-new Gallant , Fit for the choycest eyes ? have I not gold ? The friendship of the world ? if they shun me now ( Though I were the arrantest rogue , as I am well forward ) Mine own curse , and the Devils too light on me .
Is't not Septimius ?
Yes .
He that kill 'd Pompey ?
The same Dog , Scab ; that guilded botch , that rascal .
How glorious villany appears in Egypt !
Gallants , and Souldiers , sure they do admire me .
Stand further off , thou stinkest .
A likely matter : These Cloaths smell mustily , do they not , Gallants ? They stink , they stink , alas poor things , contemptible.By all the Gods in Egypt , the perfumesThat went to trimming these cloathes , cost me --
Thou stinkest still .
The powdering of this head too --
If thou hast it , I'le tell thee all the Gumms in sweet ArabiaAre not sufficient , were they burnt about thee , To purge the scent of a rank Rascal from thee .
I smell him now : fie , how the Knave perfumes him , How strong he scents of Traitor !
You had an ill Millener , He laid too much of the Gum of IngratitudeUpon your Coat , you should have washt off that Sir , Fie , how it choaks ! too little of your loyaltie , Your honesty , your faith , that are pure Ambers ; I smell the rotten smell of a hired Coward , A dead Dog is sweeter .
Ye are merry Gentlemen , And by my troth , such harmless mirth takes me too , You speak like good blunt Souldiers ; and 't is well enough : But did you live at Court , as I do , Gallants , You would refine , and learn an apter language ; I have done ye simple service on your Pompey , You might have lookt him yet this brace of twelve monthsAnd hunted after him , like foundred Beagles , Had not this fortunate hand --
He brags o n't too : By the good Gods , rejoyces i n't ; thou wretchThou most contemptible Slave .
Dog , mangy Mongrel , Thou murdring mischief , in the shape of SouldierTo make all Souldiers hatefull ; thou diseaseThat nothing but the Gallows can give ease to. --
Thou art so impudent , that I admire thee , And know not what to say .
I know your angerAnd why you prate thus : I have found your melancholy : Ye all want mony , and you are liberal Captains , And in this want will talk a little desperately : Here 's gold , come share ; I love a brave Commander : And be not peevish , do as Cæsar does : He 's merry with his wench now , be you jovial , And let 's all laugh and drink : would he have partners ? I do consider all your wants , and weigh 'em , He has the Mistris , you shall have the maids , I'le bring 'em to ye , to your arms .
I blush , All over me , I blush , and sweat to hear him : Upon my conscience , if my arms were on nowThrough them I should blush too : pray ye let 's be walking .
Yes , yes : but e 're we goe , I'le leave this lesson , And let him study it : first Rogue , then Pander , Next Devil that will be ; get thee from mens presence , And where the name of Souldier has been heard ofBe sure thou live not : to some hungry desertWhere thou canst meet with nothing but thy conscience , And that in all the shapes of all thy vill [ anie ] sAttend thee still , where bruit Beasts will abhor thee , And even the Sun will shame to give thee light , Goe hide thy head : or if thou think'st it fitterGoe hang thy self .
Hark to that clause .
And that speedily , That nature may be eas 'd of such a Monster. [ Exit .
Yet all this moves not me : nor reflects on me : I keep my gold still , and my confidence , Their want of breeding makes these fellows murmur , Rude valors , so I let 'em pass ; rude honours : There is a wench yet , that I know , affects meAnd company for a King : a young plump villain , That when she sees this gold , she'l leap upon me .
Eros.And here she comes : I am sure of her at midnight , My pretty Eros welcom .
I have business .
Above my love , thou canst not .
Yes indeed Sir , Far , far above .
Why , why so coy ? 'pray ye tell meWe are alone .
I am much asham 'd we are so .
You want a new Gown now , & a handsom Petticoat , A Skarf , and some odd toyes : I have gold here ready , Thou shal [ t ] have any thing .
I want your absence : Keep on your way , I care not for your company .
How ? how ? you are very short : do you know me Eros ? And what I have been to ye ?
Yes I know ye : And I hope I shall forget ye : Whilst you were honestI lov 'd ye too .
Honest ? come prethee kiss me .
I kiss no knaves , no Murderers , no Beasts , No base betrayers of those men that fed 'em , I hate their looks ; and though I may be wanton , I scorn to nourish it with bloody purchase , Purchase so foully got ; I pray ye unhand meI had rather touch the plague , than one unworthy : Goe seek some Mistris that a horse may marry , And keep her company , she is too good for ye. [ Exit .
Marry this goes near ; now I perceive I am hatefull , When this light stuff can distinguish , it grows dangerous , For mony , seldom they refuse a Leper : But sure I am more odious , more diseas 'd too:
Souldiers.It sits cold here ; what are these ? three poor Souldiers ? Both poor and lame : their misery may make 'emA little look upon me , and adore me , If these will keep me company , I am made yet .
The pleasure Cæsar sleeps in , makes us miserable , We are forgot , our maims and dangers laugh 'd at ; He Banquets , and we beg .
He was not wontTo let poor Souldiers that have spent their Fortunes , Their Bloods , and limbs , walk up and down like vagabonds .
Save ye good Souldiers : good poor men , heaven help ye : You have born the brunt of war , and shew the story,
Some new commander sure .
You look ( my good friends ) By your thin faces , as you would be Suitors .
To Cæsar , for our means , Sir .
And 't is fit Sir .
We are poor men , and long forgot .
I grieve for it : Good Souldiers should have good rewards , and favours , I'le give up your petitions , for I pity ye , And freely speak to Cæsar .
O we honour ye .
A good man sure ye are : the Gods preserve ye .
And to relieve your wants the while , hold Soldiers , Nay 't is no dream : 't is good gold : take it freely , 'Twill keep ye in good heart .
Now goodness quit ye .
I'le be a friend to your afflictions , And eat , and drink with ye too , and we'l be merry : And every day I'le see ye .
You are a Souldier , And one sent from the Gods , I think .
I'le cloth ye , Ye are lame , and then provide good lodging for ye : And at my Table , where no want shall meet ye .
Sceva .
Was never such a man .
Dear honour 'd Sir , Let us but know your name , that we may worship ye .
That we may ever thank .
Why , call me any thing , No matter for my name , that may betray me .
A cunning thief , call him Septimius , Souldiers , The villain that kill 'd Pompey .
How ?
Call him the shame of men. [ Exit .
O that this monyWere weight enough to break thy brains out : fling all : And fling our curses next : let them be mortal , Out bloody wolf , dost thou come guilded over , And painted with thy charitie , to poyson us ?
I know him now : may never Father own thee , But as a monstrous birth shun thy base memory : And if thou hadst a Mother ( as I cannotBelieve thou wert a natural Burden ) let her wombBe curs 'd of women for a bed of vipers .
Me thinks the ground shakes to devour this rascal , And the kind air turns into foggs and vapours , Infectious mists , to crown his villanies.Thou maist go wander , like a thing heaven hated .
And valiant minds hold poysonous to remember.The Hangman will not keep thee company , He has an honourable house to thine , No , not a thief though thou couldst save his life for'tWill eat thy bread , nor one , for thirst starv 'd , drink with thee .
Thou art no company for an honest dog , And so we'l leave thee to a ditch ( thy destiny. ) [ Exeunt .
Contemn 'd of all ? and kickt too ? now I find it ; My valour 's fled too , with mine honesty , For since I would be knave I must be Coward : This 't is to be a Traitor , and betrayer.What a deformity dwells round about me ! How monstrous shews that man , that is ungratefull ! I am afraid the very beasts will tear me , Inspir 'd with what I have done : the winds will blast me : Now I am paid , and my reward dwells in me , The wages of my fact , my soul 's opprest ; Honest and noble minds , you find most rest.

I have commanded , and it shall be so , A preparation I have set o ' foot , Worthy the friendship and the fame of Cæsar , My Sisters favours shall seem poor and wither 'd : Nay she her self , ( trim 'd up in all her beautys ) Compar 'd to what I'le take his eyes withall , Shall be a dream .
Do you mean to shew the glory , And wealth of Egypt ?
Yes : and in that lustre,
shall appear in all her famous Conquests , And all her riches of no note unto it .
Now you are reconcil 'd to your fair Sister , Take heed Sir , how you step into a danger : A danger of this precipice : but note Sir , For what Rome ever rais 'd her mighty armies ; First for ambition , then for wealth : 't is madness , Nay more , a secure impotence , to temptAn armed Guest : feed not an eye , that conquers , Nor teach a fortunate sword the way to be covetous .
Ye judge amiss , and far too wide to alter me , Yet all be ready , as I gave direction : The secret way of all our wealth appearingNewly , and handsomely : and all about it : No more disswading : 't is my will .
I grieve for't .
I will dazel Cæsar , with excess of glory .
I fear you'l curse your will , we must obey ye. [ Exit.SCENA IV .

I wonder at the glory of this Kingdom , And the most bounteous preparation , Still as I pass , they court me with .

Haile to great CæsarMy Royal Guest , first I will feast thine eyesWith wealthy Ægypts store , and then thy palate , And wait my self upon thee. [ Treasure brought in .
What rich Service ! What mines of treasure !
My Cæsar , What do you admire ? pray ye turn , and let me talk to ye.Have ye forgot me Sir ? how , a new object ? Am I grown old o'th ' sudden , Cæsar ?
Tell meFrom whence comes all this wealth ?
Is your eye that way ? And all my Beauties banisht ?
I'le tell thee Cæsar , We owe for all this wealth to the old Nilus : We need no dropping rain to cheer the husband-man , Nor Merchant that ploughs up the Sea , to seek us ; Within the wealthy womb of reverent Nilus , All this is nourish 'd : who to do thee honour , Comes to discover his seven Deities , ( His conceal 'd heads ) unto thee : see with pleasure .
The matchless wealth of this Land !
Come , ye shall hear me .
Away : let me imagine .
How ? frown on me ? The eyes of Cæsar wrapt in storms ?
I am sorry : But let me think --
Isis , and three Labourers .
Isis. Here comes the aged River now
A little dross betray me ?
I am asham 'd I warr 'd at home , ( my friends ) When such wealth may be got abroad : what honour ? Nay everlasting glory had Rome purchas 'd , Had she a just cause but to visit Ægypt ?
SONG , AND DANCE .
The wonder of this wealth so troubles me , I am not well : good-night .
I am glad ye have it : Now we shall stir again .
Thou wealth , still haunt him .
A greedy spirit set thee on : we are happy .

Well , I shall yet find a time to tell thee Cæsar , Thou hast wrong 'd her Love : the rest here .

Ptolomy , Photinus , Achillas , Achoreus .
I told ye carefully , what this would prove to , What this inestimable wealth and gloryWould draw upon ye : I advis 'd your MajestyNever to tempt a Conquering Guest : nor addA bait , to catch a mind , bent by his TradeTo make the whole world his .
I was not heard Sir : Or what I said , lost , and contemn 'd : I dare say , ( And freshly now ) 't was a poor weakness in ye , A glorious Childishness : I watch 'd his eye , And saw how Faulcon-like it towr 'd , and flewUpon the wealthy Quarry : how round it mark 'd it : I observ 'd his words , and to what it tended ; How greedily he ask 'd from whence it came , And what Commerce we held for such abundance : The shew of Nilus , how he laboured atTo find the secret wayes the Song delivered .
He never smil 'd , I noted , at the pleasures , But fixt his constant eyes upon the treasure ; I do not think his ears had so much leisureAfter the wealth appear 'd , to hear the Musique ? Most sure he has not slept since , his mind 's troubledWith objects that would make their own still labour .
Your Sister he ne 're gaz 'd on : that 's a main note , The prime beauty of the world had no power over him .
Where was his mind the whilst ?
Where was your carefulnessTo shew an armed thief the way to rob ye ? Nay , would you give him this , 'twill excite himTo seek the rest. Ambition feels no gift , Nor knows no bounds , indeed ye have done most weakly .
Can I be too kind to my noble friend ?
To be unkind unto your noble self , but savoursOf indiscretion , and your friend has found it.Had ye been train 'd up in the wants and miseriesA souldier marches through , and known his temperanceIn offer 'd courtesies , you would have madeA wiser Master of your own , and stronger .
Why , should I give him all , he would return it : 'T is more to him , to make Kings .
Pray be wiser , And trust not with your lost wealth , your lov 'd liberty.To be a King still at your own discretionIs like a King ; to be at his , a vassail.Now take good counsel , or no more take to yeThe freedom of a Prince .
'Twill be too late else : For , since the Masque , he sent three of his Captains ( Ambitious as himself ) to view againThe glory of your wealth .
The next himself comes , Not staying for your courtesie , and takes it .
What counsel , my Achoreus ?
I'le goe pray Sir , ( For that is best counsel now ) the gods may help ye. [ Ex .
I found ye out a way but 't was not credited , A most secure way : whither will ye flye now ?
For when your wealth is gone , your power must follow .
And that diminisht also , what 's your life worth ? Who would regard it ?
You say true .
What eyeWill look upon King Ptolomy ? if they do look , It must be in scorn : For a poor King is a monster ; What ear remember ye ? 'twill be then a courtesie ( A noble one ) to take your life too from ye : But if reserv 'd , you stand to fill a victory , As who knows Conquerours minds ? though outwardlyThey bear fair streams.O Sir , does this not shake ye ? If to be honyed on to these afflictions --
I never will : I was a Fool .
For then SirYour Countreys cause falls with ye too , and fetter 'd : All Ægypt shall be plough 'd up with dishonour .
No more : I am sensible : and now my spiritBurns hot within me .
Keep it warm and fiery .
And last be counsel 'd .
I will , though I perish .
Goe in ; we'l tell you all : and then we'l execute. [ Exeunt.SCENA II .
Cleopatra , Arsino , Eros .
You are so impatient .
Have I not cause ? Women of common Beauties , and low Births , When they are slighted , are allow 'd their angers , Why should not I ( a Princess ) make him knowThe baseness of his usage ?
Yes : 't is fit : But then again you know what man .
He is no man : The shadow of a Greatness hangs upon him , And not the vertue : he is no Conquerour , H'as suffer 'd under the base dross of Nature : Poorly delivered up his power to wealth , ( The god of bed-rid men ) taught his eyes treasonAgainst the truth of love : he has rais 'd rebellion : Defi 'd his holy flames .
He will fall back again , And satisfie your Grace .
Had I been old , Or blasted in my bud , he might have shew'dSome shadow of dislike : But , to preferThe lustre of a little art , Arsino , And the poor glow-worm light of some faint Jewels , Before the life of Love , and soul of Beauty , Oh how it vexes me ! he is no Souldier , ( All honourable Souldiers are Loves servants ) He is a Merchant ; a meer wandring Merchant , Servile to gain : he trades for poor Commodities , And makes his Conquests , thefts ; some fortunate CaptainsThat quarter with him , and are truly valiant , Have flung the name of happy Cæsar on him , Himself ne 're won it : he is so base and covetous , He'l sell his sword for gold .
This is too bitter .
Oh I could curse my self , that was so foolish , So fondly childish to believe his tongue , His promising tongue , e 're I could catch his temper , I had trash enough to have cloy 'd his eyes withal , His covetous eyes ; such as I scorn to tread on : Richer than e 're he saw yet , and more tempting ; Had I known he had stoop 'd at that , I had sav 'd mine honour , I had been happy still : but let him take it , And let him brag how poorly I am rewarded : Let him goe conquer still weak wretched Ladies : Love has his angry Quiver too , his deadly , And when he finds scorn , armed at the strongest : I am a fool to fret thus , for a fool : An old blind fool too : I lose my health ? I will not : I will not cry : I will not honour himWith tears diviner than the gods he worships : I will not take the pains to curse a poor thing .
Doe not : you shall not need .
Would I were prisonerTo one I hate , that I might anger him , I will love any man , to break the heart of him : Any , that has the heart and will to kill him .
Take some fair truce .
I will goe study mischief , And put a look on , arm 'd with all my cunnings , Shall meet him like a Basilisque , and strike him : Love , put destroying flames into mine eyes , Into my smiles , deceits , that I may torture him , That I may make him love to death , and laugh at him .
Apollodorus .
Cæsar commends his Service to your Grace .
His service ? what 's his service ?
Pray ye be patient , The noble Cæsar loves still .
What 's his will ?
He craves access unto your Highness .
No : Say no : I will have none to trouble me .
Good Sister .
None I say : I will be private.Would thou hadst flung me into Nilus , keeper , When first thou gav'st consent , to bring my bodyTo this unthankfull Cæsar .
'T was your will , Madam , Nay more , your charge upon me , as I honoured ye : You know what danger I endured .
Take this , And carry it to that Lordly Cæsar sent thee : There 's a new Love , a handsom one , a rich one : One that will hug his mind : bid him make love to it : Tell the ambitious Broker , this will suffer --
He enters .
How ?
I do not use to wait , Lady , Where I am , all the dores are free , and open .
I ghess so , by your rudeness .
Ye are not angry ? Things of your tender mold , should be most gentle ; Why do you frown ? good gods , what a set-angerHave you forc 'd into your face ! Come , I must temper ye : What a coy smile was there , and a disdainfull ! How like an ominous flash it broke out from ye ! Defend me , Love , Sweet , who has anger 'd ye ?
Shew him a glass ; that false face has betrai 'd me : That base heart wrought me --
Be more sweetly angry ; I wrong 'd ye fair ?
Away with your foul flatteries : They are too gross : but that I dare be angry , And with as great a god as Cæsar is , To shew how poorly I respect his memory , I would not speak to ye .
Pray ye undoe this riddle , And tell me how I have vext ye ?
Let me think firstWhether I may put on a PatienceThat will with honour suffer me : know , I hate ye , Let that begin the story : Now I'le tell ye .
But do it milder : In a noble Lady , Softness of spirit , and a sober nature , That moves like summer winds , cool , and blows sweetness ; Shews blessed like her self .
And that great blessednessYou first reap 'd of me : till you taught my natureLike a rude storm to talk aloud , and thunder , Sleep was not gentler than my soul , and stiller ; You had the Spring of my affections : And my fair fruits I gave you leave to taste of : You must expect : the winter of mine anger : You flung me off , before the Court disgrac 'd me , When in the pride I appear 'd of all my beauty , Appear 'd your Mistress ; took into your eyesThe common-strumpet love of hated lucre , Courted with covetous heart , the slave of nature , Gave all your thoughts to gold , that men of glory , And minds adorn 'd with noble love , would kick at : Souldiers of royal mark , scorn such base purchase : Beauty and honour are the marks they shoot at ; I spake to ye then ; I courted ye , and woo 'd ye : Call 'd ye dear Cæsar , hung about ye tenderly : Was proud to appear your friend .
You have mistaken me .
But neither Eye , nor Favour , not a SmileWas I blessed back with ; but shook off rudely , And , as ye had been sold to sordid infamy , You fell before the Images of treasure , And in your soul you worship 'd : I stood slighted , Forgotten and contemn 'd ; my soft embraces , And those sweet kisses you call 'd Elyzium , As letters writ in sand , no more remembred : The name and glory of your CleopatraLaugh 'd at , and made a story to your Captains , Shall I endure ?
You are deceiv 'd in all this , Upon my life you are , 't is your much tenderness .
No , no , I love not that way ; you are cozen 'd : I love with as much ambition as a Conquerour , And where I love , will triumph .
So you shall : My heart shall be the Chariot that shall bear ye , All I have won shall wait upon ye : By the godsThe bravery of this womans mind , has fired me : Dear Mistress shall I but this night ? --
How Cæsar ? Have I let slip a second vanityThat gives thee hope ?
You shall be absolute , And Reign alone as Queen : you shall be any thing .
Make me a maid again , and then I'le hear thee ; Examine all thy art of War , to do that ; And if thou find'st it possible , I'le love thee : Till when , farewel , unthankfull .
Stay .
I will not .
I command .
Command , and goe without , Sir.I do command thee be my slave for ever , And vex while I laugh at thee .
Thus low , beauty .
It is too late ; when I have found thee absolute , The man that Fame reports thee , and to me , May be I shall think better. Farewel Conquerour. [ Exit .

If it be fear , 't is fear of your undoing , Not of our selves : fear of your poor declining : Our lives and deaths are equall benefits , And we make louder prayers to dye nobly , Than to live high , and wantonly : whilst you are secure here , And offer Hecatombs of lazie kissesTo the lewd god of love , and cowardize , And most lasci [ v ] iously dye in delights , You are begirt with the fierce Alexandrians .
The spawn of Egypt flow about your Palace , Arm 'd all : and ready to assault .
Led onBy the false and base Photinus and his Ministers ; No stirring out ; no peeping through a loop-hole , But straight saluted with an armed Dart .
No parley : they are deaf to all but danger , They swear they will fley us , and then dry our Quarters : A rasher of a salt lover , is such a Shooing-horn : Can you kiss away this conspiracy , and set us free ? Or will the Giant god of love fight for ye ? Will his fierce war-like bow kill a Cock-sparrow ? Bring out the Lady , she can quel this mutiny : And with her powerfull looks strike awe into them : She can destroy , and build again the City , Your Goddesses have mighty gifts : shew 'em her fair brests , The impregnable Bulworks of proud Love , and let 'emBegin their battery there : she will laugh at 'em ; They are not above a hundred thousand , Sir.A mist , a mist , that when her Eyes break out , Her powerfull radiant eyes , and shake their flashes , Will flye before her heats .
Begirt with Villains ?
They come to play you , and your Love a Huntsup.You were told what this same whorson wenching , long agoe wouldcome to : You are taken napping now : has not a Souldier , A time to kiss his friend , and a time to consider , But he must lye still digging , like a Pioneer , Making of mines , and burying of his honour there ? 'Twere good you would think --
And time too , or you will find elseA harder task , than Courting a coy Beauty .
Look out and then believe .
No , no , hang danger : Take me provoking broth , and then goe to her : Goe to your Love , and let her feel your valour ; Charge her whole body , when the sword 's in your throat ( Sir , ) You may cry , Cæsar , and see if that will help ye .
I'le be my self again , and meet their furies , Meet , and consume their mischiefs : make some shift , Sceva , To recover the Fleet , and bring me up two Legions , And you shall see me , how I'le break like thunderAmongst these beds of slimy Eeles , and scatter 'em .

Souldiers .
Did ye see this Penitence ?
Yes : I saw , and heard it .
And I too : look 'd upon him , and observ 'd it , He 's the strangest Septimus now --
I heard he was altered , And had given away his Gold to honest uses : Cry 'd monstrously .
He cryes abundantly : He is blind almost with weeping .
'T is most wonderfullThat a hard hearted man , and an old SouldierShould have so much kind moisture : when his Mother dy'dHe laugh 'd aloud , and made the wickedst Ballads --
'T is like enough : he never lov 'd his parents ; Nor can I blame him , for they ne'r lov 'd him.His Mother dream 'd before she was deliver'dThat she was brought abed with a Buzzard , and ever afterShe whistl 'd him up to th ' world : his brave clothes tooHe has flung away , and goes like one of us now : Walks with his hands in 's pockets , poor and sorrowfull , And gives the best instructions. --
And tells storiesOf honest and good people that were honour'dAnd how they were remembred : and runs madIf he but hear of any ungratefull person , A bloudy , or betraying man --
If it be possibleThat an Arch-Villain may ever be recovered , This penitent Rascal will put hard : 'twere worth our labourTo see him once again .
Septimius .
He spares us that labour , For here he comes .
-- Bless ye my honest friends , Bless ye from base unworthy men ; come not near me , For I am yet too taking for your company .
Did I not tell ye ?
What book 's that ?
No doubtSome excellent Salve for a sore heart : are you
, that base knave , that betray 'd Pompey ?
I was , and am ; unless your honest thoughtsWill look upon my penitence , and save me , I must be ever Villain : O good SouldiersYou that have Roman hearts , take heed of falsehood : Take heed of blood ; take heed of foul ingratitude.The Gods have scarce a mercy for those mischiefs , Take heed of pride , 't was that that brought me to it .
This fellow would make a rare speech at the gallows .
'T is very fit he were hang 'd to edifie us:
Let all your thoughts be humble , and obedient , Love your Commanders , honour them that feed ye : Pray , that ye may be strong in honestyAs in the use of arms ; Labour , and diligentlyTo keep your hearts from ease , and her base issues , Pride , and ambitious wantonness , those spoil 'd me.Rather lose all your limbs , than the least honesty , You are never lame indeed , till loss of creditBenumb ye through : Scarrs , and those maims of honourAre memorable crutches , that shall bearWhen you are dead , your noble names to Eternity .
I cry .
And so do I .
An excellent villain .
A more sweet pious knave I never heard yet .
He was happie he was Rascal , to come to this .
Achoreus.Who 's this ? a Priest ?
O stay , most holy Sir ! And by the Gods of Egypt , I conjure ye , ( Isis , and great Osiris ) pity me , Pity a loaden man , and tell me trulyWith what most humble Sacrifice I mayWash off my sin , and appease the powers that hate me ? Take from my heart those thousand thousand furies , That restless gnaw upon my life , and save me .
bloody hands fell on his Mother , Yet , at the holy altar he was pardon 'd .
Orestes out of madness did his murther , And therefore he found grace : thou ( worst of all men ) Out of cold blood , and hope of gain , base lucre , Slew'st thine own Feeder : come not near the altar , Nor with thy reeking hands pollute the Sacrifice , Thou art markt for shame eternal. [ Exit .
Look all on me , And let me be a story left to timeOf blood and Infamy , how base and uglyIngratitude appears , with all her profits , How monstrous my hop 'd grace , at Court ! good souldiersLet neither flattery , nor the witching soundOf high and soft preferment , touch your goodness : To be valiant , old , and honest , O what blessedness --
Dost thou want any thing ?
Nothing but your prayers .
Be thus , and let the blind Priest do his worst , We have gods as well as they , and they will hear us .
Come , cry no more : thou hast wep't out twenty Pompeys .
Photinus , Achillas .
So penitent ?
It seems so .
Yet for all thisWe must employ him .
These are the arm 'd Souldier leaders:
How now ? why thus ? what cause of this dejection ?
Why dost thou weep ?
Pray leave me , you have ruin 'd me , You have made me a famous Villain .
Does that touch thee ?
He will be hard to win : he feels his lewdness .
He must be won , or we shall want our right hand.This fellow dares , and knows , and must be heartned.Art thou so poor to blench at what thou hast done ? Is Conscience a comrade for an old Soldier ?
It is not that : it may be some disgraceThat he takes heavily ; and would be cherish'd,
ever scorn 'd to shew such weakness .
Let me alone ; I am not for your purpose , I am now a new man .
We have new affairs for thee , Those that would raise thy head .
I would 'twere off , And in your bellies for the love you bear me.I'le be no more Knave : I have stings enoughAlready in my breast .
Thou shalt be noble : And who dares think then that thou art not honest ?
Thou shalt command in Chief , all our strong ForcesAnd if thou serv'st an use , must not all justifie it ?
I am Rogue enough .
Thou wilt be more , and baser : A poor Rogue is all Rogues : open to all shames : Nothing to shadow him : dost thou think cryingCan keep thee from the censure of the Multitude ? Or to be kneeling at the altar save thee ? 'T is poor and servile : Wert thou thine own Sacrifice'Twould seem so low , people would spit the fire out .
Keep thy self glorious still , though ne 're so stain 'd , And that will lessen it , if not work it out.To goe complaining thus , and thus repentingLike a poor Girl that had betrai 'd her maide [ n ] -head --
I'le stop mine ears .
Will shew so in a Souldier , So simply , and so ridiculously , so tamely --
If people would believe thee , 'twere some honesty , And for thy penitence would not laugh at thee ( As sure they will ) and beat thee for thy poverty : If they would allow thy foolery , there were some hope .
My foolery ?
Nay , more than that , thy misery , Thy monstrous misery .
He begins to hearken : Thy misery so great , men will not bury thee .
That this were true !
Why does this conquering CæsarLabour through the worlds deep Seas of toyls and troubles , Dangers , and desperate hopes ? to repent afterwards ? Why does he slaughter thousands in a Battel , And whip his Country with the sword ? to cry for't ? Thou killd'st great Pompey ; he'l kill all his kindred , And justifie it : nay raise up Trophies to it.When thou hear'st him repent , ( he 's held most holy too ) And cry for doing daily bloody murthers , Take thou example , and go ask forgiveness , Call up the thing thou nam'st thy conscience , And let it work : then 'twill seem well Septimius .
He does all this .
Yes : and is honour 'd for it ; Nay call 'd the honour 'd Cæsar , so maist thou be : Thou wert born as near a Crown as he .
He was poor .
And desperate bloody tricks got him this credit .
I am afraid you will once more --
Help to raise thee : Off with thy pining black , it dulls a Souldier , And put on resolution like a man , A noble Fate waits on thee .
I now feelMy self returning Rascal speedily.O that I had the power --
Thou shalt have all : And do all through thy power , men shall admire thee , And the vices of Septimius shall turn vertues .
Off : off : thou must off : off my cowardize , Puling repentance off .
Now thou speakst nobly .
Off my dejected looks : and welcom impudence : My daring shall be Deity , to save me : Give me instructions , and put action on me : A glorious cause upon my swords point , Gentlemen , And let my wit , and valour work : you will raise me , And make me out-dare all my miseries ?
All this , and all thy wishes .
Use me then , Womanish fear farewell : I'le never melt more , Lead on , to some great thing , to wake my spirit : I cut the Cedar Pompey , and I'le fellThis huge Oak Cæsar too .
Now thou singst sweetly : And Ptolomy shall crown thee for thy service .
He 's well wrought : put him on apace for cooling. [ Exeunt .
Cæsar , Antony , Dolabella .
The tumult still encreases .
O my fortune ! My lustfull folly rather ! but 't is well , And worthily I am made a bondsmans prey , That after all my glorious victories , In which I pass 'd so many Seas of dangers , When all the Elements conspir 'd against me , Would yield up the dominion of this headTo any mortal power : so blind and stupid , To trust these base Egyptians , that proclaim'dTheir perjuries , in noble Pompeys death , And yet that could not warn me .
Be still Cæsar , Who ever lov 'd to exercise his fate , Where danger look't most dreadful .
If you fall , Fall not alone : let the King and his SisterBe buried in your ruines : on my lifeThey both are guilty : reason may assure you
nor Achillas durst attempt you , Or shake one Dart , or sword , aim 'd at your safety , Without their warrant .
For the young King I know notHow he may be misled ; but for his Sister ( Unequall 'd Cleopatra ) 'twere a kindOf blasphemy to doubt her : ugly treasonDurst never dwell in such a glorious building , Nor can so clear and great a spirit , as hers is , Admit of falsehood .
Let us seize on him then : And leave her to her fortune .
If he have powerUse it to your security , and letHis honesty acquit him : if he be falseIt is too great an honour he should dyeBy your victorious hand .
He comes : and IShall do as I find cause .
Ptolomy , Achoreus , Apollodorus .
Let not great CæsarImpute the breach of hospitality , To you ( my guest ) to me ; I am contemn 'd , And my rebellious subjects lift their handsAgainst my head : and would they aim 'd no farther , Provided that I fell a sacrificeTo gain you safety : that this is not feign 'd , The boldness of my innocence may confirm you : Had I been privy to their bloody plot , I now had led them on , and given fair glossTo their bad cause , by being present with them : But I that yet taste of the punishment , In being false to Pompey , will not makeA second fault to Cæsar uncompel'dWith such as have not yet shook off obedience , I yield my self to you , and will take partIn all your dangers .
This pleads your excuse , And I receive it .
If they have any touchOf justice , or religion , I will useThe authority of our Gods , to call them backFrom their bad purpose .
This part of the palaceIs yet defensible : we may make it good , Till your powers rescue us .
Cæsar besieg 'd ? O stain to my great actions : 't was my custom , An Army routed , as my feet had wingsTo be first in the chase : nor walls , nor BulworksCould guard those that escap 'd the Battels furyFrom this strong Arm ; and I to be enclos 'd ? My heart ! my heart ! but 't is necessity , To which the Gods must yield , and I obey , 'Till I redeem it by some glorious way. [ Exeunt.SCENA II .
Photinus , Achillas , Septimius , Souldiers .
There 's no retiring now , we are broke in : The deed past hope of pardon : if we prosper'Twill be stil 'd lawful ! , and we shall give lawsTo those that now command us : stop not atOr loyalty , or duty : bold ambition , To dare and power to do , gave the first differenceBetween the King , and subject , Cæsars Motto,
, each of us must claim , And use it as our own .
The deed is bloodyIf we conclude in Ptolomies death .
The better , The globe of Empire must be so manur 'd .
Rome , that from Romulus first took her name , Had her walls water 'd with a Crimson showrDrain 'd from a Brothers heart : nor was she rais'dTo this prodigious height , that overlooksThree full parts of the Earth , that pay her tribute , But by enlarging of her [ n ] arrow boundsBy the Sack of Neighbour Cities , not made hersTill they were Cemented with the Blood of thoseThat did possess 'em : Cæsar , Ptolomy , ( Now I am steel 'd ) to me are empty namesEsteem 'd as Pompeys was .
Well said Septimius , Thou now art right again .
But what course take weFor the Princess Cleopatra ?
Let her liveAwhile to make us sport : she shall authorizeOur undertakings to the ignorant people , As if what we do were by her command : But our triumvirat Government once confirm 'd , She bears her Brother company , that 's my Province : Leave me to work her .
I will undertakeFor Ptolomy .
Cæsar shall be my task , And as in Pompey I began a nameI'le perfect it in Cæsar .
Cæsar , Ptolomy , Achoreus , Apollodorus , Antony , Dolabella .
'T is resolv 'd then , We 'll force our passage .
See , they do appearAs they desir 'd a Parley .
I am proud yetI have brought 'em to capitulate .
Now , Photinus ?
Now , Ptolomy ?
No addition ?
We are equal , Though Cæsars name were put into the scale , In which our worth is weigh 'd .
Presumptuous Villain , Upon what grounds hast thou presum 'd to raiseThy servile hand against the King , or me , That have a greater name ?
On those , by whichThou didst presume to pass the RubiconAgainst the Laws of Rome ; and at the nameOf Traitor smile ; as thou didst when Marcellus , The Consul , with the Senates full consentPronounc 'd thee for an Enemy to thy Country , Yet thou wentst on , and thy rebellious CauseWas crown 'd with fair success : Why should we fear then ? Think on that , Cæsar .
O the gods ! be brav 'd thus , And be compell 'd to bear this from a SlaveThat would not brook Great Pompey his Superiour ?
Thy glories now have toucht the highest point , And must descend .
Despair , and think we standThe Champions of Rome , to wreak her wrongs , Upon whose liberty thou hast set thy foot .
And that the Ghosts of all those noble RomansThat by thy Sword fell in this Civil WarExpect revenge .
Dar'st thou speak , and rememberThere was a Pompey ?
There is no hope to 'scape us : If that against the odds we have upon youYou dare come forth , and fight , receive the honourTo dye like Romans , if ye faint , resolveTo starve like Wretches ; I disdain to changeAnother syllable with you. [ Exeunt .
Let us dye nobly ; And rather fall upon each others SwordThan come into these Villains hands .
That Fortune , Which to this hour hath been a Friend to Cæsar , Though for a while she cloath her Brow with frowns , Will smile again upon me : who will pay her , Or sacrifice , or Vows , if she forsakeHer best of works in me ? or suffer him , Whom with a strong hand she hath led triumphantThrough the whole western world , and Rome acknowledg'dHer Soveraign Lord , to end in-gloriouslyA life admir 'd by all ? The threatned dangerMust by a way more horrid be avoided , And I will run the hazard ; Fire the Palace , And the rich Magazines that neighbour it , In which the Wealth of Egypt is contain 'd : Start not , it shall be so ; that while the peopleLabour in quenching the ensuing flames , Like Cæsar , with this handful of my friendsThrough Fire , and Swords I force a passage toMy conquering Legions. King , if thou dar 'd followWhere Cæsar leads , or live or dye a Free-man ; If not , stay here a Bond-man to thy Slave , And dead , be thought unworthy of a Grave. [ Exeunt.SCENE III .
Septimius .
I feel my resolution melts againAnd that I am not Knave alone , but fool , In all my purposes. The Devil , Photinus , Employs me as a Property , and grown uselessWill shake me off again ; he told me soWhen I kill 'd Pompey ; nor can I hope better , When Cæsar is dispatch 'd ; Services doneFor such as only study their own ends , Too great to be rewarded , are return'dWith deadly hate ; I learn 'd this PrincipleIn his own School , yet still he fools me , well ; And yet he trusts me : Since I in my natureWas fashion 'd to be false , wherefore should IThat kill 'd my General , and a Roman , oneTo whom I ow 'd all nourishments of life , Be true to an Egyptian ? To save Cæsar , And turn Photinus 's plots on his own head , As it is in my power , redeem my credit , And live to lye and swear again in fashion , Oh , 'twere a master-piece ! ha ! -- me Cæsar , How 's he got off ?
Cæsar , Ptolomy , Antony , Dolabella , Achoreus , Apollodorus , Souldiers .
The fire has took , And shews the City like a second Troy , The Navy too is scorch 'd , the people greedyTo save their Wealth and Houses , whilst their SouldiersMake spoil of all ; only Achillas 's TroopsMake good their Guard , break through them , we are safe ; I 'll lead you like a Thunder-bolt .
Stay , Cæsar .
Who 's this ? the Dog , Septimius ?
Cut his throat .
You bark 'd but now , fawn you so soon ?
O hear me , What I 'll deliver is for Cæsars safety , For all your good .
Good from a mouth like thine , That never belch 'd but blasphemy , and treason on Festival days !
I am an altered man , altered indeed , And will give you cause to say I am a Roman .
Rogue , I grant thee .
Trust me , I 'll make the passage smooth , and easieFor your escape .
I 'll trust the Devil sooner , And make a safer Bargain .
I am trustedWith all Photinus 's secrets .
There 's no doubt thenThou wilt be false .
Still to be true to you .
And very likely .
Be brief , the means ?
Thus , Cæsar , To me alone , but bound by terrible oathsNot to discover it , he hath reveal'dA dismal Vault , whose dreadful mouth does openA mile beyond the City : in this CaveLye but two hours conceal 'd .
If you believe him , He 'll bury us alive .
I 'll flye in the Air first .
Then in the dead of night I 'll bring you backInto a private room , where you shall find
, and Achillas , and the restOf their Commanders close at Council .
Good , what follows ?
Fall me fairly on their throats , Their heads cut off and shorn , the multitudeWill easily disperse .
O Devil ! away with him ; Nor true to Friend nor Enemy ? Cæsar scornsTo find his safety , or revenge his wrongsSo base a way ; or owe the means of lifeTo such a leprous Traytor , I have towr'dFor Victory like a Faulcon in the Clouds , Nor dig 'd for't like a Mole ; our Swords and CauseMake way for us , and that it may appearWe took a noble Course , and hate base Treason , Some Souldiers that would merit Cæsar 's favour , Hang him on yonder Turret , and then followThe lane this Sword makes for you. [ Exit .
Here 's a Belt , Though I dye for it I 'll use it .
'T is too goodTo truss a Cur in .
Save me , here 's Gold .
If RomeWere offered for thy ransom , it could not help thee .
Hang not an arse .
Goad him on with thy Sword ; Thou dost deserve a worser end , and mayAll such conclude so , that their friends betray. [ Exeunt.SCENE IV .
Arsino , Eros , Cleopatra .
We are lost .
Undone .
Confusion , Fire , and Swords , And fury in the Souldiers face more horridCircle us round .
The Kings Command they laugh at , And jeer at Cæsars threats .
My Brother seiz 'd onBy the Roman , as thought guilty of the tumult , And forc 'd to bear him company , as mark 'd outFor his protection or revenge .
They have brokeInto my Cabinet ; my Trunks are ransack 'd .
I have lost my jewels too : but that 's the least : The barbarous Rascals , against all humanity , Or sense of pity , have kill 'd my little Dog , And broke my Monkeys Chain .
They rifled me : But that I could endure , would they proceed no further .
O my Sister !
My Queen , my Mistress !
Can you stand unmov'dWhen the Earth-quake of Rebellion shakes the City , And the Court trembles ?
Yes , Arsino , And with a Masculine Constancy derideFortunes worst malice , as a Servant toMy Vertues , not a Mistress ; then we forsakeThe strong Fort of our selves , when we once yield , Or shrink at her assaults ; I am still my self , And though disrob 'd of Soveraignty , and ravish'dOf ceremonious duty , that attends it , Nay , grant they had slav 'd my Body , my free mindLike to the Palm-tree walling fruitful Nile , Shall grow up straighter and enlarge it self'Spight of the envious weight that loads it with : Think of thy Birth ( Arsino ) common burdensFit common Shoulders ; teach the multitudeBy suffering nobly what they fear to touch at ; The greatness of thy mind does soar a pitch , Their dim eyes ( darkened by their narrow souls ) Can not arrive at .
I am new created , And owe this second being to you ( best Sister ) For now I feel you have infus 'd into mePart of your fortitude .
I still am fearful ; I dare not tell a lie ; you that were bornDaughters and Sisters unto Kings , may nourishGreat thoughts , which I , that am your humble handmaidMust not presume to rival .
Yet ( my Eros ) Though thou hast profited nothing by observingThe whole course of my life , learn in my death , Though not to equal , yet to imitateThy fearless Mistress .
Photinus .
O , a man in Arms ! His Weapon drawn too ?
Though upon the pointDeath sate , I 'll meet it , and outdare the danger .
Keep the Watch strong , and guard the passage sureThat leads unto the Sea .
What Sea of rudenessBreaks in upon us ? or what Subjects BreathDare raise a storm , when we command a calm ? Are Duty and Obedience fled to Heaven ? And in their room ambition and prideSent into Egypt ? That Face speaks thee , Photinus , A thing thy Mother brought into the World ; My Brother 's and my Slave : but thy behaviour , Oppos 'd to that , an insolent intruderUpon that Soveraignty thou shouldst bow to.If in the Gulph of base ingratitude , All loyalty to Ptolomy the KingBe swallowed up , remember who I am , Whose Daughter and whose Sister ; or supposeThat is forgot too ; let the name of CæsarWhich Nations quake at , stop the desperate madnessFrom running headlong on to thy Confusion.Throw from thee quickly those rebellious Arms , And let me read submission in thine Eyes ; Thy wrongs to us we will not only pardon , But be a ready advocate to plead for theeTo Cæsar , and my Brother .
Plead my Pardon ? To you I bow , but scorn as much to stoop thusTo Ptolomy or Cæsar , Nay , the gods , As to put off the figure of a man , And change my Essence with a sensual Beast ; All my designs , my counsels , and dark endsWere aim 'd to purchase you .
How durst thou , beingThe scorn of baseness , nourish such a thought ?
They that have power are royal ; and those baseThat live at the devotion of another.What birth gave Ptolomy , or fortune Cæsar , By Engines fashion 'd in this Protean AnvilI have made mine ; and only stoop at you , Whom I would still preserve free to command me ; For Cæsar 's frowns , they are below my thoughts , And but in these fair Eyes I still have readThe story of a supream Monarchy , To which all hearts with mine gladly pay tribute,
Name had long since been as greatAs Ptolomies e'r was , or Cæsars is , This made me as a weaker tye to unlooseThe knot of Loyalty , that chain 'd my freedom , And slight the fear that Cæsars threats might cause , That I and they might see no Sun appearBut Cleopatra in the Egyptian Sphear .
O Giant-like Ambition ! marryed to
darkness ! inconsiderate Fool , ( Though flatter 'd with self-love ) could'st thou believe , Were all Crowns on the Earth made into one , And that ( by Kings ) set on thy head ; all Scepters , Within thy grasp , and laid down at my feet , I would vouchsafe a kiss to a no-man ? A guelded Eunuch ?
Fairest , that makes for me , And shews it is no sensual appetite , But true love to the greatness of thy Spirit , That when that you are mine shall yield me pleasures,
, though blessing a new married PairShall blush to think on , and our certain issue , The glorious splendor of dread Majesty , Whose beams shall dazel Rome , and aw the world , My wants in that kind others shall supply , And I give way to it .
Baser than thy Birth ; Can there be gods , and hear this , and no thunderRam thee into the Earth ?
They are asleep , And can not hear thee ; Or with open Eyes , Did Jove look on us , I would laugh and swearThat his artillery is cloy 'd by me : Or if that they have power to hurt , his BoltsAre in my hand .
Most impious !
They are dreams , Religious Fools shake at : yet to assure thee , If Nemesis , that scourges pride and scorn , Be any thing but a name , she lives in me ; For by my self ( an oath to me more dreadfulThan Stix is to your gods ) weak Ptolomy dead , And Cæsar ( both being in my toil ) remov 'd , The poorest Rascals that are in my CampShall in my presence quench their lustful heatIn thee , and young Arsino , while I laughTo hear you howl in vain : I deride those gods , That you think can protect you .
To prevent thee , In that I am the Mistress of my Fate ; So hope I of my sister to confirm it.I spit at thee , and scorn thee .
I will tameThat haughty courage , and make thee stoop too .
Never , I was born to command , and will dye so .
Achillas , and Souldiers , with the Body of Ptolomy .
The King dead ? this is a fair entrance toOur future happiness .
Oh my dear Brother !
Weep not , Arsino , common women do so , Nor lose a tear for him , it can not help him ; But study to dye nobly .
Cæsar fled ! 'T is deadly aconite to my cold heart , It choaks my vital Spirits : where was your care ? Did the Guards sleep ?
He rowz 'd them with his Sword ; We talk of Mars , but I am sure his CourageAdmits of no comparison but it self , And ( as inspir 'd by him ) his following friendsWith such a confidence as young Eagles preyUnder the large wing of their fiercer Dam , Brake through our Troops and scatter 'd them , he went onBut still pursu 'd by us , when on the sudden , He turn 'd his head , and from his Eyes flew terrour ; Which strook in us no less fear and amazement , Than if we had encounter 'd with the lightningHurl 'd from Jove 's cloudy Brow .
'T was like my Cæsar .
We faln back , he made on , and as our fearHad parted from us with his dreadful looks , Again we follow 'd ; but got near the Sea ; On which his Navy anchor 'd ; in one handHolding a Scroll he had above the waves , And in the other grasping fast his Sword , As it had been a Trident forg 'd by VulcanTo calm the raging Ocean , he made awayAs if he had been Neptune , his friends likeSo many Tritons follow 'd , their bold shoutsYielding a chearful musick ; we showr 'd dartsUpon them , but in vain , they reach 'd their shipsAnd in their safety we are sunk ; for CæsarPrepares for War .
How fell the King ?
UnableTo follow Cæsar , he was trod to deathBy the Pursuers , and with him the PriestOf Isis , good Achoreus .
May the EarthLye gently on their ashes .
I feel now , That there are powers above us ; and that 't is notWithin the searching policies of manTo alter their decrees .
I laugh at thee ; Where are thy threats now , Fool , thy scoffs and scornsAgainst the gods ? I see calamityIs the best Mistress of Religion , And can convert an Atheist. [ Shout within .
O they come , Mountains fall on me ! O for him to dyeThat plac 'd his Heaven on Earth , is an assuranceOf his descent to Hell ; where shall I hide me ? The greatest daring to a man dishonest , Is but a Bastard Courage , ever fainting. [ Exit .
Cæsar , Sceva , Antony , Dolabella .
Look on your Cæsar ; banish fear , my fairest , You now are safe .
By Venus , not a kissTill our work be done ; the Traitors once dispatch'dTo it , and we 'll cry aim .
I will be speedy. [ Exeunt .
Farewel again , Arsino ; how now , Eros ? Ever faint-hearted ?
But that I am assur 'd , Your Excellency can command the General , I fear the Souldiers , for they look as ifThey would be nibling too .
He is all honour , Nor do I now repent me of my favours , Nor can I think that Nature e'r made a WomanThat in her prime deserv 'd him .
Cæsar , Sceva , Antonie , Dolabella , Souldiers , with theHeads .
He 's come back , Pursue no further ; curb the Souldiers fury .
See ( beauteous Mistris ) their accursed headsThat did conspire against us .
Furies plague 'em , They had too fair an end to dye like Souldiers,
fell by the Sword , the Cross or HalterShould have dispatch 'd them .
All is but death , good Sceva , Be therefore satisfied : and now my dearest , Look upon Cæsar , as he still appear'dA Conquerour , and this unfortunate KingEntomb 'd with honour , we 'll to Rome , where CæsarWill shew he can give Kingdoms ; for the Senate , ( Thy Brother dead ) shall willingly decreeThe Crown of Egypt ( that was his ) to thee.

Disswade me not .
It will breed a brawl .
I care not , I wear a Sword .
And wear discretion with it , Or cast it off , let that direct your arm , 'T is madness else , not valour , and more baseThan to receive a wrong .
Why would you have meSit down with a disgrace , and thank the doer ? We are not Stoicks , and that passive courageIs only now commendable in Lackies , Peasants , and Tradesmen , not in men of rankAnd qualitie , as I am .
Do not cherishThat daring vice , for which the whole age suffers.The blood of our bold youth , that heretoforeWas spent in honourable action , Or to defend , or to enlarge the Kingdom , For the honour of our Country , and our Prince , Pours it self out with prodigal expenceUpon our Mothers lap , the Earth that bred usFor every trifle ; and these private Duells , Which had their first original from the Fr [ enc ] h ( And for which , to this day , we are justly censured ) Are banisht from all civil Governments : Scarce three in Venice , in as many years ; In Florence , they are rarer , and in allThe fair Dominions of the Spanish King , They are never heard of : Nay , those neighbour Countries , Which gladly imitate our other follies , And come at a dear rate to buy them of us , Begin now to detest them .
Will you end yet --
And I have heard that some of our late Kings , For the lie , wearing of a Mistris favour , A cheat at Cards or Dice , and such like causes , Have lost as many gallant Gentlemen , As might have met the great Turk in the fieldWith confidence of a glorious Victorie , And shall we then --
No more , for shame no more , Are you become a Patron too ? 't is a new one , No more o n't , bur n't , give it to some Orator , To help him to enlarge his exercise , With such a one it might do well , and profitThe Curat of the Parish , but for Cleremont , The bold , and undertaking Cleremont , To talk thus to his friend , his friend that knows him,
that knows his Cleremont , is absurd , And meer Apocrypha .
Why , what know you of me ?
Why if thou hast forgot thy self , I'le tell thee , And not look back , to speak of what thou wertAt fifteen , for at those years I have heardThou wast flesh 'd , and enter 'd bravely .
Well Sir , well .
But yesterday , thou wast the common second , Of all that only knew thee , thou hadst billsSet up on every post , to give thee noticeWhere any difference was , and who were parties ; And as to save the charges of the LawPoor men seek arbitrators , thou wert chosenBy such as knew thee not , to compound quarrels : But thou wert so delighted with the sport , That if there were no just cause , thou wouldst make one , Or be engag 'd thy self : This goodly callingThou hast followed five and twenty years , and studiedThe Criticismes of contentions , and art thouIn so few hours transform 'd ? certain this nightThou hast had strange dreams , or rather visions .
Yes , Sir , I have seen fools , and fighters , chain 'd together , And the Fighters had the upper hand , and whipt first , The poor Sots laughing at 'em. What I have beenIt skils not , what I will be is resolv 'd on .
Why then you'l fight no more ?
Such is my purpose .
On no occasion ?
There you stagger me.Some kind of wrongs there are which flesh and bloodCannot endure .
Thou wouldst not willinglyLive a protested coward , or be call 'd one ?
Words are but words .
Nor wouldst thou take a blow ?
Not from my friend , though drunk , and from an enemyI think much less .
There 's some hope of thee left then , Wouldst thou hear me behind my back disgrac 'd ?
Do you think I am a rogue ? they that should do itHad better been born dumb .
Or in thy presenceSee me o'recharg 'd with odds ?
I 'd fall my self first .
Would'st thou endure thy Mistris be taken from thee , And thou sit quiet ?
There you touch my honour , No French-man can endure that .
Pl -- -- upon thee , Why dost thou talk of Peace then ? that dar'st sufferNothing , or in thy self , or in thy friendThat is unmanly ?
That I grant , I can not : But I'le not quarrel with this GentlemanFor wearing stammel Breeches , or this GamesterFor playing a thousand pounds , that owes me nothing ; For this mans taking up a common WenchIn raggs , and lowsie , then maintaining herCaroach 'd in cloth of Tissue , nor five hundredOf such like toyes , that at no part concern me ; Marry , where my honour , or my friend is questioned , I have a Sword , and I think I may use itTo the cutting of a Rascals throat , or so , Like a good Christian .
Thou art of a fine Religion , And rather than we'l make a Schism in friendshipI will be of it : But to be serious , Thou art acquainted with my tedious love-suitTo fair Lamira ?
Too well Sir , and rememberYour presents , courtship , that 's too good a name , Your slave-like services , your morning musique ; Your walking three hours in the rain at midnight , To see her at her window , sometimes laugh 'd at , Sometimes admitted , and vouchsaf 'd to kissHer glove , her skirt , nay , I have heard , her slippers , How then you triumph 'd ? Here was love forsooth .
These follies I deny not , Such a contemptible thing my dotage made me , But my reward for this --
As you deserv 'd , For he that makes a goddess of a Puppet , Merits no other recompence .
This day friend , For thou art so --
I am no flatterer .
This proud , ingratefull she , is married toLame Champernel .
I know him , he has beenAs tall a Sea-man , and has thriv 'd as well by't , The loss of a legg and an arm deducted , as anyThat ever put from Marseilles : you are tame , Pl -- -- o n't , it mads me ; if it were my case , I should kill all the family .
Yet but nowYou did preach patience .
I then came from confession , And 't was enjoyn 'd me three hours for a penance , To be a peaceable man , and to talk like one , But now , all else being pardon 'd , I beginOn a new Tally , Foot do any thing , I'le second you .
I would not willinglyMake red , my yet white conscience , yet I purposeIn the open street , as they come from the Temple , ( For this way they must pass , ) to speak my wrongs , And do it boldly. [ Musick playes .
Were thy tongue a Cannon , I would stand by thee , boy , they come , upon 'em .
Observe a little first .
This is fine fidling .
Vertaign , Champernel , Lamira , Nurse , Beaupre , Verdone. An Epithalamium.SONG at the Wedding.Come away , bring on the BrideAnd place her by her Lovers side : You fair troop of Maids attend her , Pure and holy thoughts befriend her.Blush , and wish , you Virgins all , Many such fair nights may fall.Chorus.Hymen , fill the house with joy , All thy sacred fires employ : Bless the Bed with holy love , Now fair orb of Beauty move .
Stand by , for I'le be heard .
This is strange rudeness .
'T is courtship , ballanced with injuries , You all look pale with guilt , but I will dyYour cheeks with blushes , if in your sear 'd veinsThere yet remain so much of honest bloodTo make the colour ; first to ye my Lord , The Father of this Bride , whom you have sentAlive into her grave .
How ? to her grave ?
This was spoke home indeed .
Sir , I shall take some other time to tell you , That this harsh language was delivered toAn old man , but my Father .
At your pleasure .
Proceed in your design , let me alone , To answer him , or any man .
You presumeToo much upon your name , but may be couzen 'd .
But for you , most unmindfull of my service , For now I may upbraid you , and with honour , Since all is lost , and yet I am a gainer , In being deliver 'd from a torment in you , For such you must have been , you to whom natureGave with a liberal hand most excellent form , Your education , language , and discourse , And judgement to distinguish , when you shallWith feeling sorrow understand how wretchedAnd miserable you have made your self , And but your self have nothing to accuse , Can you with hope from any beg compassion ? But you will say , you serv 'd your Fathers pleasure , Forgetting that unjust commands of ParentsAre not to be obey 'd , or that you are rich , And that to wealth all pleasure else are servants , Yet but consider , how this wealth was purchas 'd , 'Twill trouble the possession .
You Sir knowI got it , and with honour .
But from whom ? Remember that , and how : you'l come indeedTo houses bravely furnish 'd , but demandingWhere it was bought , this Souldier will not lie , But answer truly , this rich cloth of ArrasI made my prize in such a Ship , this PlateWas my share in another ; these fair Jewels , Coming a shore , I got in such a Village , The Maid , or Matron kill 'd , from whom they were ravish 'd , The Wines you drink are guilty too , for this , This Candie Wine , three Merchants were undone , These Suckets break as many more : in brief , All you shall wear , or touch , or see , is purchas'dBy lawless force , and you but revel inThe tears , and grones of such as were the owners .
'T is false , most basely false .
Let losers talk .
Lastly , those joyes , those best of joyes , which HymenFreely bestows on such , that come to tyeThe sacred knot be blesses , won unto itBy equal love , and mutual affection , Not blindly led with the desire of riches , Most miserable you shall never taste of.This Marriage night you'l meet a Widows bed , Or failing of those pleasures all Brides look for , Sin in your wish it were so .
Thou art a Villain , A base , malitious slanderer .
Strike him .
No , he is not worth a blow .
O that I had theeIn some close vault , that only would yield roomTo me to use my Sword , to thee no hopeTo run away , I would make thee on thy knees , Bite out the tongue that wrong 'd me .
Pray you have patience .
This day I am to be your Soveraign , Let me command you .
This is the Courtship , That you must look for , Madam .
'Twill do well , When nothing can be done , to spend the night with : Your tongue is sound good Lord , and I could wishFor this young Ladyes sake this leg , this arm , And there is something else , I will not name , ( Though 't is the only thing that must content her ) Had the same vigour .
You shall buy these scoffsWith your best blood : help me once noble anger , ( Nay stir not , I alone must right my self ) And with one leg transport me , to correctThese scandalous praters : O that noble wounds [ Falls.Should hinder just revenge ! D 'ye jear me too ? I got these , not as you do , your diseasesIn Brothels , or with riotous abuseOf wine in Taverns ; I have one leg shot , One arm disabled , and am honour 'd more , By losing them , as I did , in the faceOf a brave enemy , than if they wereAs when I put to Sea ; you are French-men only , In that you have been laied , and cur 'd , goe to : You mock my leg , but every bone about you , Makes you good Almanack-makers , to foretellWhat weather we shall have .
Put up your Sword .
Or turn it to a Crutch , there't may b [ e ] usefull , And live on the relation to your WifeOf what a brave man you were once .
And tell her , What a fine vertue 't is in a young LadyTo give an old man pap .
Or hire a SurgeonTo teach her to roul up your broken limbs .
To make a Pultess , and endure the scentOf oils , and nasty Plasters .
Fie Sir , fie , You that have stood all dangers of all kinds , toYield to a Rivalls scoffe ?
Shed tears uponYour Wedding day ? this is unmanly Gentlemen .
They are tears of anger : O that I should liveTo play the woman thus ! All powerfull heaven , Restore me , but one hour , that strength again , That I had once , to chastise in these menTheir folies , and ill manners , and that done , When you please , I'le yield up the fort of life , And do it gladly .
We ha ' the better of him , We ha ' made him cry .
You shall have satisfaction.And I will do it nobly , or disclaim me .
I say no more , you have a Brother , Sister , This is your wedding day , we are in the street , And howsoever they forget their honour , 'T is fit I lose not mine , by their example .
If there be Laws in Paris , look to answerThis insolent affront .
You that live by them , Study 'em for heavens sake ; for my part I know notNor care not what they are. Is the [ re ] ought elseThat you would say ;
Nothing , I have my ends .
weeps , I have said too much I fear ; So dearly once I lov 'd her , that I cannotEndure to see her tears. [ Exeunt Dinant , and Cleremont .
See you perform it , And do it like my Nephew .
If I fail in'tNe'r know me more , Cousin Beaupre .
Repent notWhat thou hast done , my life , thou shalt not findI am decrepit ; in my love and service , I will be young , and constant , and believe me , For thou shalt find it true , in scorn of allThe scandals these rude men have thrown upon meI'le meet thy pleasures with a young mans ardour , And in all circumstances of a Husband , Perform my part .
Good Sir , I am your servant , And 't is too late now , if I did repent , ( Which as I am a virgin yet , I do not ) To undoe the knot , that by the Church is tyed.Only I would beseech ye , as you haveA good opinion of me , and my vertues , For so you have pleas 'd to stile my innocent weakness , That what hath pass 'd be [ t ] ween Dinant and me , Or what now in your hearing he hath spoken , Beget not doubts , or fears .
I apprehend you , You think I will be jealous ; as I liveThou art mistaken sweet ; and to confirm itDiscourse with whom thou wilt , ride where thou wilt , Feast whom thou wilt , as often as thou wilt , For I will have no other guards upon theeThan thine own thoughts .
I'le use this libertyWith moderation Sir .
I am resolv'd.Steal off , I'le follow you .
Come Sir , you droop ; Till you find cause , which I shall never give , Dislike not of your Son in Law .
Sir , you teach meThe language I should use ; I am most happyIn being so near you. [ Exeunt Verdone , and Beaupre .
O my fears ! good nurseFollow my Brother unobserv 'd , and learnWhich way he takes .
I will be carefull Madam. [ Exit Nurse .
Between us complements are superfluous , On Gentlemen , th ' affront we have met hereWe'l think upon hereafter , 'twere unfitTo cherish any thought to breed unrest , Or to our selves , or to our Nuptial feast. [ Exeunt .
Dinant , and Cleremont .
We shall have sport , ne'r fear't .
What sport I prethee ?
Why we must fight , I know it , and I long for't , It was apparent in the fiery eyeOf young Verdone , Beaupre look 'd pale and shook too , Familiar signs of anger. They are both brave fellowsTri 'd and approv 'd , and I am proud to encounterWith men , from whom no honour can be lost ; They will play up to a man , and set him off.When e 're I go to the field , heaven keep me fromThe meeting of an unflesh 'd youth or , Coward , The first , to get a name , comes on too hot , The Coward is so swift in giving ground , There is no overtaking him withoutA hunting Nag , well breath 'd too .
All this while , You ne'r think on the danger .
Why 't is no moreThan meeting of a dozen friends at Supper , And drinking hard ; mischief comes there unlook 'd for , I am sure as suddain , and strikes home as often , For this we are prepar 'd .
Lamira LovesHer Brother Beaupre dearly .
What of that ?
And should he call me to account for whatBut now I spake , nor can I with mine honourRecant my words , that little hope is left me , E 're to enjoy what ( next to Heaven ) I long for , Is taken from me .
Why what can you hope for , She being now married ?
Oh my Cleremont , To you all secrets of my heart lye open , And I rest most secure that whatsoe'reI lock up there , is as a private thought , And will no farther wrong me. I am a French-man , And for the greater part we are born Courtiers , She is a woman , and however yet , No heat of service had the power to meltHer frozen Chastity , time and opportunitieMay work her to my ends , I confess ill ones , And yet I must pursue 'em : now her marriage , In probabilitie , will no way hurt , But rather help me .
Sits the wind there ? pray you tell meHow far off dwells your love from lust ?
Too near , But prethee chide me not .
Not I , goe on boy , I have faults my self , and will not reprehendA crime I am not free from : for her Marriage , I do esteem it ( and most batchellors areOf my opinion ) as a fair protection , To play the wanton without loss of honour .
Would she make use of't so , I were most happy .
No more of this. Judge now , Whether I have the gift of prophecie .
Beaupre , and Verdone .
Monsieur Dinant , I am glad to find you , Sir .
I am at your service .
Good Monsieur Cleremont , I have long wish'dTo be known better to you .
My desiresEmbrace your wishes Sir .
Sir , I have everEsteem 'd you truly noble , and professI should have been most proud , to have had the honourTo call you Brother , but my Fathers pleasureDenied that happiness. I know no man lives , That can command his passions , and thereforeDare not condemn the late intemperate languageYou were pleas 'd to use to my Father and my Sister , He 's old and she a woman , I most sorrieMy honour does compel me to entreat you , To do me the favour , with your sword to meet meA mile without the Citie .
You much honour me.In the demand , I'le gladly wait upon you .
O Sir you teach me what to say : the time ?
With the next Sun , if you think fit .
The place ?
Near to the vineyard eastward from the Citie .
I like it well , this Gentleman if you pleaseWill keep me company .
That is agreed on ; And in my friends behalf I will attend him .
You shall not miss my service .
Good day Gentlemen. [ Ex. Beaup. and Verd .
At your Commandment .
Proud to be your servants.I think there is no Nation under HeavenThat cut their enemies throats with complement , And such fine tricks as we do : If you haveAny few Prayers to say , this night you mayCall 'em to mind and use 'em , for my self , As I have little to lose , my care is less , So till to morrow morning I bequeath youTo your devotions ; and those paid , but useThat noble courage I have seen , and weShall fight , as in a Castle .
Thou art all honour , Thy resolution would steel a Coward , And I most fortunate in such a Friend ; All tenderness and nice respect of womanBe now far from me , reputation takeA full possession of my heart , and proveHonour the first place holds , the second Love. [ Exeunt .
Lamira , Charlote .
Sleeps my Lord still , Charlote ?
Not to be wak'd.By your Ladiships cheerfull looks I well perceiveThat this night the good Lord hath beenAt an unusual service , and no wonderIf he rest after it .
You are very bold .
Your Creature Madam , and when you are pleas'dSadness to me 's a stranger , your good pardonIf I speak like a fool , I could have wishtTo have ta'ne your place to night , had bold DinantYour first and most obsequious servant tastedThose delicates , which by his lethargieAs it appears , have cloy 'd my Lord .
No , more .
I am silenc 'd , Madam .
Saw you my nurse this morning ?
No Madam .
I am full of fears. [ Knock within.Who 's that ?
She you enquir 'd for .
Bring her in , and leave me. [ Exit Charlote.Now nurse what news ?
Nurse .
O Ladie dreadfull ones.They are to fight this morning , there 's no remedie.I saw my Lord your Brother , and VerdoneTake horse as I came by .
Where 's Cleremont ?
I met him too , and mounted .
Where 's Dinant ?
There 's all the hope , I have staid him with a trick , If I have done well so .
What trick ?
I told him , Your Ladiship laid your command upon him , To attend you presently , and to confirm it , Gave him the ring he oft hath seen you wear , That you bestowed on me : he waits withoutDisguis 'd , and if you have that power in him , As I presume you have , it is in youTo stay or alter him .
Have you learnt the place , Where they are to encounter ?
Yes 't is whereThe Duke of Burgundie met Lewis th ' eleventh .
Enough , I will reward thee liberally , [ Exit Nurse.Goe bring him in : full dear I loved Dinant , While it was lawfull , but those fires are quench'dI being now anothers , truth forgive meAnd let dissimulation be no crime , Though most unwillingly I put it onTo guard a Brothers safetie .
Dinant .
Now your pleasure , Though ill you have deserv 'd it , you perceiveI am still your fool , and can not but obeyWhat ever you command .
You speak , as ifYou did repent it , and 't is not worth my thanks then , But there has been a time , in which you wouldReceive this as a favour .
Hope was left thenOf recompence .
Why I am still Lamira , And you Dinant , and 't is yet in my power , I dare not say I'le put it into act , To reward your love and service .
There 's some comfort .
But think not that so low I prize my fame , To give it up to any man that refusesTo buy it , or with danger of performanceOf what I shall enjoin him .
Name that dangerBe it of what horrid shape soever LadieWhich I will shrink at ; only at this instantBe speedie i n't .
I'le put you to the trial : You shall not fight to day , do you start at that ? Not with my Brother , I have heard your difference , Mine is no Helens beauty to be purchas'dWith blood , and so defended , if you look forFavours from me , deserve them with obedience , There 's no way else to gain 'em .
You commandWhat with mine honour I can not obey , Which lies at pawn against it , and a friendEqually dear as that , or life , engag 'd , Not for himself , but me .
Why , foolish man , Dare you solicite me to serve your lust , In which not only I abuse my Lord , My Father , and my family , but write whore , Though not upon my forehead , in my conscience , To be read hourly , and yet name your honour ? Yours suffers but in circumstance ; mine in substance.If you obey me , you part with some credit , From whom ? the giddy multitude ; but mankindWill censure me , and justly .
I will lose , What most I do desire , rather than hazardSo dear a friend , or write my self a coward , 'T is better be no man .
This will not do ; Why , I desire not , you should be a coward , Nor do I weigh my Brothers life with yours , Meet him , fight with him , do , and kill him fairly , Let me not suffer for you , I am careless .
Suffer for me ?
For you , my kindness to youAlready brands me with a strumpets name .
O that I knew the wretch !
I will not name him , Nor give you any Character to know him ; But if you dare , and instantly ride forthAt the west port of the City , and defend thereMy reputation , against all you meet , For two hours only , I'le not swear Dinant , To satisfie , ( though sure I think I shall ) What ever you desire , if you denie this , Be desperate , for willingly , by this light , I'le never see thee more .
Two hours , do you say ?
Only two hours .
I were no Gentleman , Should I make scruple of it ; this favour arms me , And boldly I 'll perform it. [ Exit .
I am glad on't.This will prevent their meeting yet , and keepMy Brother safe , which was the mark I shot at. [ Exit .
Cleremont , as in the field .
I am first i'th ' field , that honour 's gain 'd of our side , Pray Heaven I may get off as honourablie , The hour is past , I wonder Dinant comes not , This is the place , I can not see him yet ; It is his quarel too that brought me hither , And I ne'r knew him yet , but to his honourA firm and worthy Friend , yet I see nothing , Nor Horse nor man , 'twould vex me to be left here , To th ' mercy of two swords , and two approv 'd ones.I never knew him last .
Beaupre , and Verdone .
You are well met Cleremont .
You are a fair Gentleman , and love your friend Sir.What are you ready ? the time has overta'ne us .
And this you know the place .
No Dinant yet ?
We come not now to argue , but to do ; We wait you Sir .
There 's no time past yet Gentlemen , We have day enough : is't possible he comes not ? You see I am ready here , and do but stayTill my Friend come , walk but a turn or two , 'Twill not be long .
We came to fight .
Ye shall fight Gentlemen , And fight enough , but a short turn or two , I think I see him , set up your watch , we'l fight by it .
That is not he ; we will not be deluded .
Am I bob 'd thus ? pray take a pipe of tobacco , Or sing but some new air ; by that time , Gentlemen --
Come draw your Sword , you know the custome here Sir , First come , first serv 'd .
Though it be held a custom , And practised so , I do not hold it honest ; What honour can you both win on me single ?
Yield up your Sword then .
Yield my Sword ? that 's Hebrew ; I'le be first cut a p [ iec ] es ; hold but a while , I'le take the next that comes .
Gentleman.You are an old Gentleman ?
Yes indeed am I , Sir .
And wear no Sword ?
I need none , Sir .
I would you did , and had one ; I want now such a foolish courtesie.You see these Gentlemen ?
You want a second.In good Faith Sir , I was never handsom at it , I would you had my Son , but he 's in Italy , A proper Gentleman ; you may do well gallantsIf your quarrel be not capital , to have more mercy , The Gentleman may do his Country --
Now I beseech you , Sir , If you dare not fight , do not stay to beg my pardon.There lies your way .
Good morrow Gentlemen. [ Exit .
You see your fortune , You had better yield your Sword .
Pray ye stay a little .
Gentlemen.Upon mine honestie , you shall be fought with ; Well , Dinant , well , these wear swords and seem brave fellows.As you are Gentlemen , one of you supply me.I want a Second now to meet these gallants , You know what honour is .
Sir you must pardon us , We goe about the same work , you are ready for ; And must fight presently , else we were your servants .
God speed you , and good day. [ Exit Gent .
Am I thus Colted ?
Come either yield --
As you are honest Gentlemen , Stay but the next , and then I'le take my fortune , And if I fight not like a man -- Fy Dinant , Cold now and treacherous .
La-writ , within .
I understand your causes.Yours about corn , yours about pins and glasses , Will you make me mad , have I not all the parcells ? And his Petition too , about Bell-founding ? Send in your witnesses , what will you have me do ? Will you have me break my heart ? my brains are melted ; And tell your Master , as I am a Gentleman , His Cause shall be the first , commend me to your Mistris , And tell her , if there be an extraordinary feather , And tall enough for her -- I shall dispatch you too , I know your cause , for transporting of FarthingalesTrouble me no more , I say again to you , No more vexation : bid my wife send me some puddings ; I have a Cause to run through , requires puddings , Puddings enough. Farewel .
God speed you , Sir .
Would he would take this fellow .
A rare Youth .
If you be not hastie , Sir .
Yes , I am hastie , Exceeding hastie , Sir , I am going to the Parliament , You understand this bag , if you have any businessDepending there , be short , and let me hear it , And pay your Fees .
'Faith , Sir , I have a business , But it depends upon no Parliament .
I have no skill i n't then .
I must desire you , 'T is a Sword matter , Sir .
I am no Cutler , I am an Advocate , Sir .
How the thing looks ?
When he brings him to fight .
Be not so hastie , You wear a good Sword .
I know not that , I never drew it yet , or whether it be a Sword --
I must entreat you try , Sir , and bear a partAgainst these Gentlemen , I want a second ; Ye seem a man , and 't is a noble office .
I am a Lawyer , Sir , I am no fighter .
You that breed quarels , Sir , know best to satisfie .
This is some sport yet .
If this fellow should fight .
And for any thing I know , I am an arrant coward , Do not trust me , I think I am a coward .
Try , try , you are mistaken : walk on Gentlemen , The man shall follow presently .
Are ye mad Gentleman ? My business is within this half hour .
That 's all one , We 'll dispatch within this quarter , there in that bottom , 'T is most convenient Gentlemen .
Well , we 'll wait , Sir .
Why this will be a comick fight , you'l follow .
As I am a true man , I can not fight. [ Ex. Beaupre , Verdone .
Away , away , I know you can : I like your modesty , I know you will fight and so fight , with such metal , And with such judgement meet your enemies fury ; I see it in your eye , Sir .
I'le be hang 'd then ; And I charge you in the Kings name , name no more fighting .
I charge you in the Kings name , play the man , Which if you do not quickly , I begin with you , I'le make you dance , do you see your fiddlestick ? Sweet A [ d ] vocate thou shalt fight .
Stand farther Gentleman , Or I'le give you such a dust o'th ' chapps --
Spoke bravely , And like thy self , a noble Advocate : Come to thy tools .
I do not say I'le fight ;
I say thou shalt , and bravely .
If I do fight ; I say , if I do , but do not depend upo n't , And yet I have a foolish itch upon me , What shall become of my Writings ?
Let 'em ly by , They will not run away , man .
I may be kill 'd too , And where are all my causes then ? my business ? I will not fight , I can not fight , my Causes --
Thou shalt fight , if thou hadst a thousand causes , Thou art a man to fight for any cause , And carry it with honour .
Hum , say you so ? if I shouldBe such a coxcombe to prove valiant now --
I know thou art most valiant .
Do you think so ? I am undone for ever , if it prove so , I tell you that , my honest friend , for ever ; For I shall ne 're leave quarrelling.How long must we fight ? for I can not stay , Nor will not stay , I have business .
We'l do't in a minute , in a moment .
Here will I hang my bag then , it may save my belly , I never lov 'd cold Iron there .
You do wisely .
Help me to pluck my Sword out then , quickly , quickly , 'Thas not seen Sun these ten years .
How it grumbles ! This Sword is vengeance angry .
Now I'le put my hat up , And say my prayers as I goe ; away boy , If I be kill 'd , remember the little Lawyer. [ Exeunt .
Beaupre .
They are both come on , that may be a stubborn rascal , Take you that ground,
La-writ.I'le stay here , fight bravely .
To't chearfully my boyes , you'l let 's have fair play , None of your foyning tricks .
Come forward Monsieur ; [ Fight.What hast thou there ? a pudding in thy belly ? I shall see what it holds .
Put your spoon home then : Nay , since I must fight , have at you without wit , Sir : God a mercy bagg .
Nothing but bumbast in ye ? The Rogue winks and fights .
Now your fine fencing , Sir : [ Beau. loses his sword.Stand off , thou diest on point else , [ La-writ treads on it.I have it , I have it : yet further off : I have his Sword .
Then keep it , be sure you keep it .
I'le put it in my mouth else.Stand further off yet , and stand quietly , And look another way , or I'le be with you , Is this all ? I'le undertake within these two daiesTo furnish any Cutler in this Kingdom .
Pox , what fortune 's this ? disarm 'd by a puppie ? A snail ? a Dog ?
No more o ' these words Gentleman , Sweet Gentleman no more , do not provoke me , Go walk i'th ' horse-fair ; whistle Gentleman , What must I do now ?
Cleremont , pursued by Verdone .
Help me , I am almost breathless .
With all my heart , there 's a cold pye for you , Sir .
Thou strik'st me , fool .
Thou fool , stand further off then , Deliver , deliver .
Hold fast. [ He strikes up the others heels , and takes his Sword too .
I never fail i n't , There 's twelve pence , go buy you two leaden Daggers , Have I done well ?
Most like a Gentleman .
And we two basely lost .
'T is but a fortune , We shall yet find an hour. [ Ex. Beau. Verd. sad .
I shall be glad o n't .
Where 's my cloak , and my trinkets ? Or will you fight any longer , for a crash or two ?
I am your noble friend , Sir .
It may be so .
What honour shall I do you , For this great courtesie ?
All I desire of ye , Is to take the quarrel to your self , and let me hear no more o n't , I have no liking to't , 't is a foolish matter , And help me to put up my Sword .
Most willingly.But I am bound to gratifie you , and I must not leave you .
I tell you , I will not be gratified , Nor I will hear no more o n't : take the Swords too , And do not anger me but leave me quietly.For the matter of honour , 't is at your own disposure , And so , and so. [ Exit La-writ .
This is a most rare Lawyer : I am sure most valiant. Well Dinant , as you satisfie me , I say no more : I am loaden like an Armorer. [ Exit Cler .
Dinant .
To be dispatcht upon a sleeveless errand ? To leave my friend engag 'd , mine honour tainted ? These are trim things. I am set here like a Perdue , To watch a fellow , that has wrong 'd my Mistris , A scurvy fellow that must pass this way , But what this scurvy fellow is , or whence , Or whether his name be William or John , Or Anthony or Dick , or any thing , I know not ; A scurvy rascally fellow I must aim at , And there 's the office of an Asse flung on me.Sure Cleremont has fought , but how come off , And what the world shall think of me hereafter : Well , woman , woman , I must look your rascals , And lose my reputation : ye have a fine power over us.These two long hours I have trotted here , and curiouslySurvey 'd all goers by , yet find no rascal , Nor any face to quarel with : What 's that ? [ La-writ sings within , then Enters.This is a rascally voice , sure it comes this way .
He strook so hard , the Bason broke , And Tarquin heard the sound .
What Mister thing is this ? let me survey it .
And then he strook his neck in two .
This may be a rascal , but 't is a mad rascal , What an Alphabet of faces he puts on ! Hey how it fences ! if this should be the rogue , As 't is the likeliest rogue I see this day --
Was ever man for Ladies sake ? down , down .
And what are you good Sir ? down , down , down , down .
What 's that to you good Sir ? down , down .
A pox on you good Sir , down , down , down , You with your Buckram bag , what make you here ? And from whence come you ? I could fight with my shadow now .
Thou fierce man that like Sir Lancelot dost appear , I need not tell thee what I am , nor eke what I make here .
This is a precious knave , stay , stay , good Tristram , And let me ask thy mightiness a question , Did ye never abuse a Lady ?
Not ; to abuse a Lady , is very hard , Sir .
Say you so , Sir ? Didst thou never abuse her honour ?
Not ; to abuse her honour , is impossible .
Certain this is the rascal : What 's thy name ?
My name is Cock o ' two , use me respectively , I will be Cock of three else .
What 's all this ? You say , you did abuse a Lady .
You ly .
And that you wrong 'd her honour .
That 's two lyes , Speak suddenly , for I am full of business .
What art thou , or what canst thou be , thou pea-goose , That dar'st give me the ly thus ? thou mak'st me wonder .
And wonder on , till time make all things plain .
You must not part so , Sir , art thou a Gentleman ?
Ask those upon whose ruins I am mounted .
This is some Cavellero Knight o'th ' Sun .
I tell thee I am as good a Gentleman as the Duke ; I have atchieved -- goe follow thy business .
But for this Lady , Sir --
Why , hang this Lady , Sir , And the Lady Mother too , Sir , what have I to do with Ladies ?
Cleremont .
'T is the little Lawyers voice : has he got my way ? It should be hereabouts .
Ye dry bisket rogue , I will so swinge you for this blasphemie -- Have I found you out ?
That should be Dinants tongue too .
And I defy thee do thy worst : O ho quoth Lancelot tho.And that thou shalt know , I am a true Gentleman , And speak according to the phrase triumphant ; Thy Lady is a scurvy Lady , and a shitten Lady , And though I never heard of her , a deboshed Lady , And thou , a squire of low degree ; will that content thee ? Dost [ thou ] way-lay me with Ladies ? A pretty sword , Sir , A very pretty sword , I have a great mind to't .
You shall not lose your longing , rogue .
Hold , hold.Hold Dinant , as thou art a Gentleman .
As much as you will , my hand is in now .
I am your friend , Sir : Dinant you draw your swordUpon the Gentleman preserv 'd your honour : This was my second , and did back me nobly , For shame forbear .
I ask your mercy , Sir , and am your servant now .
May we not fight then ?
I am sure you shall not now .
I am sorry for't , I am sure I'le stay no longer then , Not a jot longer : are there any more on ye afore ? I will sing still , Sir. [ Exit La-writ , singing .
I look now you should chide me , and 't is fit , And with much bitterness express your anger , I have deserv 'd : yet when you know --
I thank ye , Do you think that the wrong you have off'red me , The most unmanly wrong , unfriendly wrong --
I do confess --
That boyish sleight --
Not so , Sir .
That poor and base renouncing of your honour , Can be allaied with words ?
I give you way still .
Coloured with smooth excuses ? Was it a friends part , A Gentlemans , a mans that wears a Sword , And stands upon the point of reputation , To hide his head then , when his honour call 'd him ? Call 'd him aloud , and led him to his fortune ? To halt and slip the coller ? by my life , I would have given my life I had never known thee , Thou hast eaten Canker-like into my judgementWith this disgrace , thy whole life can not heal again .
This I can suffer too , I find it honest .
Can you pretend an excuse now may absolve you , Or any thing like honest , to bring you off ? Ingage me like an Asse ?
Will you but hear me ?
Expose me like a Jade to tug , and hale through , Laugh 'd at , and almost hooted ? your disgracesInvite mens Swords and angers to dispatch me .
If you will be patient .
And be abus 'd still : But that I have call 'd thee friend , And to that name allow a Sanctuary , You should hear further from me , I would not talk thus : But henceforth stand upon your own bottom , Sir , And bear your own abuses , I scorn my swordShould travel in so poor and empty quarrels .
Ha ' you done yet ? take your whole swing of anger , I'le bear all with content .
Why were you absent ?
You know I am no Coward , you have seen that , And therefore , out of fear forsook you not : You know I am not false , of a treacherous nature , Apt to betray my friend , I have fought for you too ; You know no business , that concern 'd my state , My kindred , or my life .
Where was the fault then ?
The honour of that Lady I adore , Her credit , and her name : ye know she sent for me , And with what haste .
What was he that traduc 'd ?
The man i'th ' Moon , I think , hither I was sent , But to what end --
Lady .
This is a pretty flim-flam .
I am glad I have met you Sir , I have been seeking , And seeking every where .
And now you have found him , Declare what business , our Embassadour .
What 's that to ye good man flouter ? O Sir , my Lady .
Prethee no more of thy Lady , I have too much o n't .
Let me have a little , speak to me .
To you Sir ? 'T is more than time : All occasions set aside Sir , Or whatsoever may be thought a business --
What then ?
Repair to me within this hour .
Where ?
What 's that to you ? come you , Sir , when y'are sent for .
God a mercy Mumpsimus , You may goe Dinant , and follow this old Fairie , Till you have lost your self , your friends , your credit , And Hunt away your youth in rare adventures , I can but grieve I have known you .
Will ye goe Sir ? I come not often to you with these blessings , You m [ a ] y believe that thing there , and repent it , That dogged thing .
Peace touchwood .
I will not goe : Goe bid your Lady seek some fool to fawn on her , Some unexperienc 'd puppie to make sport with , I have been her mirth too long , thus I shake from meThe fetters she put on ; thus her enchantmentsI blow away like wind , no more her beauty --
Take heed Sir what you say .
Goe forward , Dinant .
The charms shot from her eyes --
Be wise .
Be Valiant .
That tongue that tells fair tales to mens destructionsShall never rack me more .
Stay there .
Goe forward .
I will now hear her , see her as a woman , Survey her , and the power man has allow 'd , Sir , As I would do the course of common things , Unmov 'd , unstruck .
Hold there , and I forgive thee .
She is not fair , and that that makes her proud , Is not her own , our eyes bestow it on her , To touch and kiss her is no blessedness , A Sun-burnt Ethiops lip 's as soft as her's.Goe bid her stick some other triumph up , And take into her favour some dull fool , That has no pretious time to lose , no friends , No honour , nor no life , like a bold Merchant , A bold and banquerupt man , I have ventur 'd all these , And split my bottom : return this answer to her , I am awake again and see her mischiefs , And am not now , on every idle errand , And new coyn 'd anger , to be hurried , And then despis 'd again , I have forgot her .
If this be true --
I am sorry , I have troubled you , More sorrie , that my Lady has adventur'dSo great a favour in so weak a mind : This hour you have refus 'd that when you come to know it , Will run you mad , and make you curse that fellow , She is not fair , nor handsom , so I leave you .
Stay Lady , stay , but is there such a business ?
You would break your neck 'twere yours .
My back , you would say .
But play the friends part still , Sir , and undoe him , 'T is a fair office .
I have spoke too liberally .
I shall deliver what you say .
You shall be hang 'd first , You would fain be prating now ; take the man with you .
Not I , I have no power .
You may goe Dinant .
'T is in 's own will , I had no further charge , Sir , Than to tell him what I did , which if I had thoughtIt should have been receiv 'd so --
'Faith you may , You do not know how far it may concern you.If I perceiv 'd any trick i n't .
'Twill end there .
'T is my fault then , there is an hour in fortune , That must be still observ 'd : you think I'le chide you , When things must be , nay see , an he will hold his head up ? Would such a Lady send , with such a charge too ? Say she has plaid the fool , play the fool with her again , The great fool , the greater still the better.He shall goe with you woman .
As it please him , I know the way alone else .
Where is your Lady ?
I shall direct you quickly .
Well , I'le goe , But what her wrongs will give me leave to say .
We 'll leave that to your selves : I shall hear from you .
As soon as I come off --
Come on then bravely ; Farewel till then , and play the man .
You are merry ; All I expect is scorn : I'le lead you Lady. [ Exeunt severally .
Champernel , Lamira , Beaupre , Verdone , Charlotte .
We'l venture on him .
Out of my doors I charge thee , see me no more .
Your Nephew ?
I disclaim him , He has no part in me , nor in my blood , My Brother that kept fortune bound , and leftConquest hereditary to his IssueCould not beget a coward .
I fought , Sir , Like a good fellow , and a Souldier too , But men are men , and can not make their fates : Ascribe you to my Father what you please , I am born to suffer .
All disgraces wretch .
Good Sir be patient .
Was there no tree , ( For to fall by a noble enemies sword , A Coward is unworthy ) nor no River , To force thy life out backward or to drown it , But that thou must survive thy i [ n ] famie ? And kill me with the sight of one I hate , And gladly would forget ?
Sir , his misfortuneDeserves not this reproof .
In your opinion , 'T is fit you two should be of one belief , You are indeed fine gallants , and fight bravelyI'th ' City with your tongues , but in the fieldHave neither spirit to dare nor power to do , Your swords are all lead there .
I know no duty , ( How ever you may wreak your spleen on him , ) That bindes me to endure this .
From DinantYou'l suffer more ; that ever cursed I , Should give my honour up , to the defenceOf such a thing as he is , or my LadyThat is all Innocent , for whom a dove wouldAssume the courage of a daring Eagle , Repose her confidence in one that canNo better guard her. In contempt of youI love Dinant , mine enemy , nay admire him , His valour claims it from me , and with justice , He that could fight thus , in a cause not honest , His sword edg 'd with defence of right and honour , Would pierce as deep as lightning , with that speed too , And kill as deadly .
You are as far from justiceIn him you praise , as equitie in the censureYou load me with .
Dinant ? he durst not meet us .
How ? durst not , Brother ?
Durst not , I repeat it .
Nor was it Cleremont 's valour that disarm 'd us , I had the better of him ; for Dinant , If that might make my peace with you , I dareWrite him a Coward upon every post , And with the hazard of my life defend it .
If 'twere laid at the stake you 'd lose it , Nephew .
Came he not , say you ?
No , but in his room , There was a Devil , hir 'd from some MagicianI'th ' shape of an Atturney .
'T was he did it .
And his the honour .
I could wish Dinant -- But what talk I of one that stept aside , And durst not come ?
I am such a friend to truth , I can not hear this : why do you detractThus poorly ( I should say to others basely ) From one of such approv 'd worth ?
Ha ! how 's this ?
From one so excellent in all that 's noble , Whose only weakness is excess of courage ? That knows no enemies , that he can not master , But his affections , and in them , the worstHis love to me .
To you ?
Yes , Sir , to me , I dare ( for what is that which Innocence dares not ) To you profess it : and he shun 'd not the CombatFor fear or doubt of these : blush and repent , That you in thought e 're did that wrong to valour .
Why , this is rare .
'Fore heaven , exceeding rare ; Why modest Lady , you that sing such EncomiumsOf your first Suiter --
How can ye convince usIn your reports ?
With what you can not answer , 'T was my command that staid him .
Your command ?
Mine , Sir , and had my will rank 'd with my power , And his obedience , I could have sent himWith more ease , weaponless to you , and bound , Than have kept him back , so well he loves his honourBeyond his life .
Better , and better still .
I wrought with him in private to divert himFrom your assur 'd destruction , had he met you .
In private ?
Yes , and us 'd all Arts , all CharmsOf one that knew her self the absolute MistrisOf all his faculties .
Gave all rewards tooHis service could deserve ; did not he takeThe measure of my sheets ?
Do not look yellow , I have cause to speak ; frowns can not fright me , By all my hopes , as I am spotless to you , If I rest once assur 'd you do but doubt me , Or curb me of that freedom you once gave me --
What then ?
I'le not alone abuse your bed , that 's nothing , But to your more vexation , 't is resolv 'd on , I'le run away , and then try if DinantHave courage to defend me .
Impudent !
And on the sudden --
How are ye transform'dFrom what you were ?
I was an innocent Virgin , And I can truly swear , a Wife as pureAs ever lay by Husband , and will dy so , Let me live unsuspected , I am no servant , Nor will be us 'd like one : If you desireTo keep me constant as I would be , letTrust and belief in you beget and nurse it ; Unnecessary jealousies make more whoresThan all baits else laid to entrap our frailties .
There 's no contesting with her , from a childOnce mov 'd , she hardly was to be appeas 'd , Yet I dare swear her honest .
So I think too , On better judgement : I am no ItalianTo lock her up ; nor would I be a Dutchman , To have my Wife , my soveraign , to command me : I'le try the gentler way , but if that fail , Believe it , Sir , there 's nothing but extreamsWhich she must feel from me .
That , as you please , Sir .
You have won the breeches , Madam , look up sweetly , My Lord limps toward you .
You will learn more manners .
This is a fee , for counsel that 's unask 'd for .
Come , I mistook thee sweet , prethee forgive me , I never will be jealous : e 're I cherishSuch a mechanick humour , I'le be nothing ; I'le say , Dinant is all that thou wouldst have him , Will that suffice ?
'T is well , Sir .
Use thy freedomUncheck 'd , and unobserv 'd , if thou wilt have it , These shall forget their honour , I my wrongs.We 'll all dote on him , hell be my rewardIf I dissemble .
And that hell take meIf I affect him , he 's a lustfull villain , ( But yet no coward ) and sollicites meTo my dishonour , that 's indeed a quarrel , And truly mine , which I will so revenge , As it shall fright such as dare only thinkTo be adulterers .
Use thine own waies , I give up all to thee .
O women , women ! When you are pleas 'd you are the least of evils .
I'le rime to't , but provokt , the worst of Devils. [ Exeunt .
Sampson , and three Clients .
I know Monsieur La-writ .
Would he knew himself , Sir .
He was a pretty Lawyer , a kind of pretty Lawyer , Of a kind of unable thing .
A fine Lawyer , Sir , And would have firk 'd you up a business , And out of this Court into that .
Ye are too forwardNot so fine my friends , something he could have done , But short short .
I know your worships favour , You are Nephew to the Judge , Sir .
It may be so , And something may be done , without trotting i'th ' dirt , friends ; It may be I can take him in his Chamber , And have an hours talk , it may be so , And tell him that in 's ear ; there are such courtesies ; I will not say , I can .
We know you can , Sir .
Peradventure I , peradventure no : but where 's La-writ ? Where 's your sufficient Lawyer ?
He 's blown up , Sir .
Run mad and quarrels with the Dog he meets ; He is no Lawyer of this world now .
Your reason ? Is he defunct ? is he dead ?
No he 's not dead yet , Sir ; But I would be loth to take a lease on 's life for two hours : Alas , he is possest Sir , with the spirit of fightingAnd quarrels with all people ; but how he came to it --
If he fight well and like a Gentleman , The man may fight , for 't is a lawfull calling.Look you my friends , I am a civil Gentleman , And my Lord my Uncle loves me .
We all know it , Sir .
I think he does , Sir , I have business too , much business , Turn you some forty or fifty Causes in a week ; Yet when I get an hour of vacancie , I can fight too my friends , a little does well , I would be loth to learn to fight .
But and't please you Sir , His fighting has neglected all our business , We are undone , our causes cast away , Sir , His not appearance .
There he fought too long , A little and fight well , he fought too long indeed friends ; But ne'r the less things must be as they may , And there be wayes --
We know , Sir , if you please --
Something I'le do : goe rally up your Causes .
La-writ , and a Gentleman , at the door .
Now you may behold Sir , And be a witness , whether we lie or no .
I'le meet you at the Ordinary , sweet Gentlemen , And if there be a wench or two --
We 'll have 'em .
No handling any Duells before I come , We 'll have no going else , I hate a coward .
There shall be nothing done .
Make all the quarrelsYou can devise before I come , and let 's all fight , There is no sport else .
We 'll see what may be done , Sir .
Ha ? Monsieur La-writ .
Baffled in way of business , My causes cast away , Judgement against us ? Why there it goes .
What shall we do the whilst Sir ?
Breed new dissentions , goe hang your selves'Tis all one to me ; I have a new trade of living .
Do you hear what he saies Sir ?
The Gentleman speaks finely .
Will any of you fight ? Fighting 's my occupationIf you find your selves aggriev 'd .
A compleat Gentleman .
Avant thou buckram budget of petitions , Thou spittle of lame causes ; I lament for thee , And till revenge be taken --
'T is most excellent .
There , every man chuse his paper , and his place.I'le answer ye all , I will neglect no mans businessBut he shall have satisfaction like a Gentleman , The Judge may do and not do , he 's but a Monsieur .
You have nothing of mine in your bag , Sir .
I know not Sir , But you may put any thing in , any fighting thing .
It is sufficient , you may hear hereafter .
I rest your servant Sir .
No more words GentlemenBut follow me , no more words as you love me , The Gentleman 's a noble Gentleman.I shall do what I can , and then --
We thank you Sir. [ Ex. Sam. and Clients .
Not a word to disturb him , he 's a Gentleman .
No cause go o ' my side ? the judge cast all ? And because I was honourably employed in action , And not appear 'd , pronounce ? 't is very well , 'T is well faith , 't is well , Judge .
Cleremont .
Who have we here ? My little furious Lawyer ?
I say 't is well , But mark the end .
How he is metamorphos 'd ! Nothing of Lawyer left , not a bit of buckram , No solliciting face now , This is no simple conversion.Your servant Sir , and Friend .
You come in time , Sir,
The happier man , to be at your command then .
You may wonder to see me thus ; but that 's all one , Time shall declare ; 't is true I was a Lawyer , But I have mew 'd that coat , I hate a Lawyer , I talk 'd much in the Court , now I hate talking , I did you the office of a man .
I must confess it .
And budg 'd not , no I budg 'd not .
No , you did not .
There 's it then , one good turn requires another .
Most willing Sir , I am ready at your service .
There , read , and understand , and then deliver it .
This is a Challenge , Sir,
'T is very like , Sir , I seldom now write Sonnets .
O admirantis , To Monsieur Vertaign , the President .
I chuse no Fool , Sir .
Why , he 's no Sword-man , Sir .
Let him learn , let him learn , Time , that trains Chickens up , will teach him quickly .
Why , he 's a Judge , an Old Man .
Never too OldTo be a Gentleman ; and he that is a JudgeCan judge best what belongs to wounded honour.There are my griefs , he has cast away my causes , In which he has bowed my reputation.And therefore Judge , or no Judge .
'Pray be rul 'd Sir , This is the maddest thing --
You will not carry it .
I do not tell you so , but if you may be perswaded .
You know how you us 'd me when I would not fight , Do you remember , Gentleman ?
The Devil 's in him .
I see it in your Eyes , that you dare do it , You have a carrying face , and you shall carry it .
The least is Banishment .
Be banish 'd then ; 'T is a friends part , we 'll meet in Africa , Or any part of the Earth .
Say he will not fight .
I know then what to say , take you no care , Sir,
Well , I will carry it , and deliver it , And to morrow morning meet you in the Louver , Till when , my service .
A Judge , or no Judge , no Judge. [ Exit La-writ .
This is the prettiest Rogue that e'r I read of , None to provoke to th ' field , but the old President ; What face shall I put on ? if I come in earnest , I am sure to wear a pair of Bracelets ; This may make some sport yet , I will deliver it , Here comes the President .
Vertaign , with two Gentlemen .
I shall find time , Gentlemen , To do your causes good , is not that Cleremont ?
'T is he my Lord .
Why does he smile upon me ? Am I become ridiculous ? has your fortune , Sir , Upon my Son , made you contemn his Father ? The glory of a Gentleman is fair bearing .
Mistake me not my Lord , you shall not find that , I come with no blown Spirit to abuse you , I know your place and honour due unto it , The reverence to your silver Age and Vertue .
Your face is merry still .
So is my business , And I beseech your honour mistake me not , I have brought you from a wild or rather Mad-manAs mad a piece of -- you were wont to love mirthIn your young days , I have known your Honour woo it , This may be made no little one , 't is a Challenge , Sir , Nay , start not , I beseech you , it means you no harm , Nor any Man of Honour , or Understanding , 'T is to steal from your serious hours a little laughter ; I am bold to bring it to your Lordship .
'T is to me indeed : Do they take me for a Sword-man at these years ?
'T is only worth your Honours Mirth , that 's all Sir , 'Thad been in me else a sawcy rudeness .
From one La-writ , a very punctual Challenge .
But if your Lordship mark it , no great matter .
I have known such a wrangling Advocate , Such a little figent thing ; Oh I remember him , A notable talking Knave , now out upon him , Has challeng 'd me downright , defied me mortallyI do remember too , I cast his Causes .
Why , there 's the quarrel , Sir , the mortal quarrel .
Why , what a Knave is this ? as y'are a Gentleman , Is there no further purpose but meer mirth ? What a bold Man of War ! he invites me roundly .
If there should be , I were no Gentleman , Nor worthy of the honour of my Kindred.And though I am sure your Lordship hates my Person , Which Time may bring again into your favour , Yet for the manners --
I am satisfied , You see , Sir , I have out-liv 'd those days of fighting , And therefore can not do him the honour to beat him my self ; But I have a Kinsman much of his ability , His Wit and Courage , for this call him Fool , One that will spit as senseless fire as this Fellow .
And such a man to undertake , my Lord ?
Nay he 's too forward ; these two pitch Barrels together .
Upon my soul , no harm .
It makes me smile , Why , what a stinking smother will they utter ! Yes , he shall undertake , Sir , as my Champion , Since you propound it mirth , I 'll venture on it , And shall defend my cause , but as y'are honestSport not with bloud .
Think not so basely , good Sir .
A Squire shall wait upon you from my Kinsman , To morrow morning make you sport at full , You want no Subject ; but no wounds .
That 's my care .
And so good day. [ Ex. Vertaign , and Gentlemen .
Many unto your honour.This is a noble Fellow , of a sweet Spirit , Now must I think how to contrive this matter , For together they shall go .
Dinant .
O Cleremont , I am glad I have found thee .
I can tell thee rare things .
O , I can tell thee rarer , Dost thou love me ?
Love thee ?
Dost thou love me dearly ? Dar'st thou for my sake ?
Any thing that 's honest .
Though it be dangerous ?
Pox o ' dangerous .
Nay wondrous dangerous .
Wilt thou break my heart ?
Along with me then .
I must part to morrow .
You shall , you shall , be faithful for this night , And thou hast made thy friend .
Away , and talk not. [ Exeunt .
Lamira , and Nurse .
O Nurse , welcome , where 's Dinant ?
He 's at my back.'Tis the most liberal Gentleman , this GoldHe gave me for my pains , nor can I blame you , If you yield up the fort .
How ? yield it up ?
I know not , he that loves , and gives so largely , And a young Lord to boot , or I am cozen 'd , May enter every where .
Thou'lt make me angry .
Dinant , and Cleremont .
Why , if you are , I hope here 's one will please you , Look on him with my Eyes , good luck go with you : Were I young for your sake --
I thank thee , Nurse .
I would be tractable , and as I am --
Leave the room , So old , and so immodest ! and be careful , Since whispers will 'wake sleeping jealousies , That none disturb my Lord. [ Exit Nurse .
Will you dispatch ? Till you come to the matter be not rapt thus , Walk in , walk in , I am your scout for once , You owe me the like service .
And will pay it .
As you respect our lives , speak not so loud .
Why , do it in dumb shew then , I am silenc 'd .
Be not so hasty , Sir , the golden ApplesHad a fell Dragon for their Guard , your pleasuresAre to be attempted with Herculean danger , Or never to be gotten .
Speak the means .
Thus briefly , my Lord sleeps now , and alas , Each Night , he only sleeps .
Go , keep her stirring .
Now if he 'wake , as sometimes he does , He only stretches out his hand and feels , Whether I am a bed , which being assur 'd of , He sleeps again ; but should he miss me , ValourCould not defend our lives .
What 's to be done then ?
Servants have servile faiths , nor have I anyThat I dare trust ; on noble CleremontWe safely may rely .
What man can do , Command and boldly .
Thus then in my place , You must lye with my Lord .
With an old man ? Two Beards together , that 's preposterous .
There is no other way , and though 't is dangerous , He having servants within call , and arm 'd too , Slaves fed to act all that his jealousieAnd rage commands them , yet a true friend should notCheck at the hazard of a life .
I thank you , I love my friend , but know no reason whyTo hate my self ; to be a kind of pander , You see I am willing , But to betray mine own throat you must pardon .
Then I am lost , and all my hopes defeated , Were I to hazard ten times more for you , You should find , Cleremont --
You shall not outdo me , Fall what may fall , I 'll do't .
But for his Beard --
To cover that you shall have my night Linnen , And you dispos 'd of , my Dinant and IWill have some private conference .

Charlotte , pass over the Stage withPillows , Night cloaths , and such things .
What can this Woman do , preserving her honour ? I have given her all the liberty that may be , I will not be far off though , nor I will not be jealous , Nor trust too much , I think she is vertuous , Yet when I hold her best , she 's but a Woman , As full of frailty as of faith , a poor sleight Woman , And her best thoughts , but weak fortifications , There may be a Mine wrought : Well , let 'em work then , I shall meet with it , till the signs be monstrous , And stick upon my head , I will not believe it , [ Stands private.She may be , and she may not , now to my observation .

Why do you make me stay so ? if you love me --
You are too hot and violent .
Why do you shift thusFrom one Chamber to another ?
A little delay , Sir , Like fire , a little sprinkled o'r with waterMakes the desires burn clear , and ten times hotter .
Why do you speak so loud ? I pray'e go in , Sweet Mistriss , I am mad , time steals away , And when we would enjoy --
Now fie , fie , Servant , Like sensual Beasts shall we enjoy our pleasures ?
'Pray do not kiss me then .
Why , that I will , and you shall find anon , servant .
Softly , for heavens sake , you know my friend 's engag 'd , A little now , now ; will ye go in again ?
Ha , ha , ha , ha .
Why do you laugh so loud , Precious ? Will you betray me ; ha ' my friends throat cut ?

Dinant , and Lamira : a light within .
Why do you use me thus ? thus poorly ? basely ? Work me into a hope , and then destroy me ? Why did you send for me ? this new way train me ?
Mad-man , and fool , and false man , now I 'll shew thee .
'Pray put your light out .
Nay I 'll hold it thus , That all chaste Eyes may see thy lust , and scorn it.Tell me but this when you first doted on me , And made suit to enjoy me as your Wife , Did you not hold me honest ?
Yes , most vertuous .
And did not that appear the only lustreThat made me worth your love and admiration ?
I must confess --
Why would you deal so basely ? So like a thief , a Villain ?
Peace , good Madam .
I 'll speak aloud too ; thus maliciously , Thus breaking all the Rules of honesty , Of honour and of truth , for which I lov 'd you , For which I call 'd you servant , and admir 'd you ; To steal that Jewel purchas 'd by another , Piously set in Wedlock , even that Jewel , Because it had no flaw , you held unvaluable : Can he that has lov 'd good , dote on the Devil ? For he that seeks a Whore , seeks but his Agent ; Or am I of so wild and low a blood ? So nurs 'd in infamies ?
I do not think so , And I repent .
That will not serve your turn , Sir .
It was your treaty drew me on .
But it was your villanyMade you pursue it ; I drew you but to tryHow much a man , and nobly thou durst stand , How well you had deserv 'd the name of vertuous ; But you like a wild torrent , mix 'd with allBeastly and base affections came floating on , Swelling your poyson 'd billows --
Will you betray me ?
To all the miseries a vext Woman may .
Let me but out , Give me but room to toss my Sword about me , And I will tell you y'are a treacherous woman , O that I had but words !
They will not serve you .
But two-edg 'd words to cut thee ; a Lady traytor ? Perish by a proud Puppet ? I did you too much honour , To tender you my love , too much respected youTo think you worthy of my worst embraces.Go take your Groom , and let him dally with you , Your greasie Groom ; I scorn to imp your lame stock , You are not fair , nor handsome , I lyed loudly , This tongue abus 'd you when it spoke you beauteous .
'T is very well , 't is brave .
Put out your light , Your lascivious eyes are flames enoughFor Fools to find you out ; a Lady Plotter ! Must I begin your sacrifice of mischief ? I and my friend , the first-fruits of that bloud , You and your honourable Husband aim at ? Crooked and wretched you are both .
To you , Sir , Yet to the Eye of Justice straight as Truth .
Is this a womans love ? a womans mercy ? Do you profess this seriously ? do you laugh at me ?
Ha , ha .
Pl -- -- light upon your scorns , upon your flatteries , Upon your tempting faces , all destructions ; A bedrid winter hang upon your cheeks , And blast , blast , blast those buds of Pride that paint you ; Death in your eyes to fright men from these dangers : Raise up your trophy , Cleremont .
What a vengeance ail you ?
What dismal noise ! is there no honour in you ?
, we are betrayed , betrayed , sold by a woman ; Deal bravely for thy self .

'T is well , Lady ; The honour of this deed will be your own , The world shall know your bounty .
What shall we do with 'em ?
Geld me , For 't is not fit I should be a man again , I am an Ass , a Dog .
Take your revenges , You know my Husbands wrongs and your own losses .
A brave man , an admirable brave man ; Well , well , I would not be so tryed again ; A very handsome proper Gentleman .
Will you let me lye by her but one hour more , And then hang me ?
We wait your malice , put your swords home bravely , You have reason to seek bloud .

To be abus 'd too ? Lady , you might have help 'd this .
Sir now 't is past , but 't may be I may standYour friend hereafter , in a greater matter .
Never whilst you live .
You can not tell -- now , Sir , a parting hand .
Down and Roses : Well I may live to see you again. A dull Rogue , No revelation in thee .
Were you well frighted ? Were your fitts from the heart , of all colds and colours ? That 's all your punishment .
It might have been all yours , Had not a block-head undertaken it .
Your swords you must leave to these Gentlemen .
And now , when you dare fight , We are on even Ice again .
'T is well : To be a Mistris , is to be a monster , And so I leave your house , and you for ever .
Leave your wild lusts , and then you are a master .
You may depart too .
I had rather stay here .
Faith we shall fright you worse .
Not in that manner , There 's five hundred Crowns , fright me but so again .
Come Cleremont , this is the hour of fool .
Wiser the next shall be or we 'll to School. [ Exeunt .
How coolly these hot gallants are departed ! Faith Cousin , 't was unconscionably done , To lye so still , and so long .
'T was your pleasure , If 'twere a fault , I may hereafter mend .
O my best Wife , Take now what course thou wilt , and lead what life .
The more trust you commit , the more care still , Goodness and vertue shall attend my will .
Let 's laugh this night out now , and count our gains.We have our honours home , and they their pains. [ Exeunt omnes .
Cleremont , Dinant .
It holds , they will go thither .
To their Summer-house ?
Thither i'th ' evening , and which is the most infliction , Only to insult upon our miseries .
Are you provided ?
Yes , yes .
Throughly ?
Throughly .
Basta , enough , I have your mind , I will not fail you .
At such an hour .
Have I a memory ? A Cause , and Will to do ? thou art so sullen --
And shall be , till I have a fair reparation .
I have more reason , for I scaped a fortune , Which if I come so near again : I say nothing , But if I sweat not in another fashion -- O , a delicate Wench .
'T is certain a most handsome one .
And me thought the thing was angry with it self tooIt lay so long conceal 'd , but I must part with you , I have a scene of mirth , to drive this from my heart , And my hour is come .
Miss not your time .
I dare not. [ Exeunt severally .
Sampson , and a Gentleman .
I presume , Sir , you now need no instruction , But fairly know , what belongs to a Gentleman ; You bear your Uncles cause .
Do not disturb me , I understand my cause , and the right carriage .
Be not too bloody .
As I find my enemy ; if his sword bite , If it bite , Sir , you must pardon me .
No doubt he is valiant , He durst not undertake else,
He 's most welcome , As he is most valiant , he were no man for me else .
But say he should relent .
He dies relenting , I can not help it , he must di [ e ] relenting , If he pray , praying , ipso facto , praying , Your honourable way admits no prayer , And if he fight , he falls , there 's his quietus .
Y'are nobly punctual , let 's retire and meet 'em , But still , I say , have mercy .
I say , honour. [ Exeunt .
Champernel , Lamira , Anabel , Beaupre , Verdone , Charlote and a Servant .
Will not you go sweet-heart ?
Go ? I'le fly with thee.I stay behind ?
My Father will be there too , And all our best friends .
And if we be not merry , We have hard luck , Lady .
Faith let 's have a kind of play .
What shall it be ?
The story of Dinant .
With the merry conceits of Cleremont , His Fits and Feavers .
But I'le lie still no more .
That , as you make the Play , 'twill be rare sport , And how 'twill vex my gallants , when they hear it ! Have you given order for the Coach ?
Yes , Madam .
My easie Nag , and padd .
'T is making ready .
Where are your Horses ?
Ready at an hour , Sir : we 'll not be last .
Fie , what a night shall we have ! A roaring , merry night .
We 'll flie at all , Sir .
I'le flie at thee too , finely , and so ruffle thee , I'le try your Art upon a Country pallet .
Brag not too much , for fear I should expect it , Then if you fail --
Thou saiest too true , we all talk.But let 's in , and prepare , and after dinnerBegin our mirthful pilgrimage .
He that 's sad , A crab-face 'd Mistris cleave to him for this year. [ Exeunt .
Cleremont , and La-writ .
Since it can not be the Judge --
'T is a great deal better .
You are sure , he is his kinsman ? a Gentleman ?
As arrant a Gentleman , and a brave fellow , And so near to his blood --
It shall suffice , I'le set him further off , I'le give a removeShall quit his kindred , I'le lopp him .
Will ye kill him ?
And there were no more Cousins in the world I kill him , I do mean , Sir , to kill all my Lords kindred.For every cause a Cousin .
How if he have no more Cousins ?
The next a kin then to his Lordships favour ; The man he smiles upon .
Why this is vengeance , horrid , and dire .
I love a dire revenge : Give me the man that will all others kill , And last himself,
You stole that resolution .
I had it in a Play , but that 's all one , I wou 'd see it done .
Come , you must be more merciful .
To no Lords Cousins in the world , I hate 'em ; A Lords Cousin to me is a kind of Cockatrice , If I see him first , he dies.A strange Antipathy .
What think you of their Nieces ?
If I like 'em , They may live , and multiply ; 't is a cold morning .
'T is sharp indeed ; you have broke your fast ?
No verily .
Your valour would have ask 'd a good foundation .
Hang him , I'le kill him fasting .
Sampson and the Gent .
Here they come , Bear your self in your language , smooth and gently , When your swords argue .
'Pray Sir , spare your precepts .
I have brought you , Sir --
'T is very well , no words , You are welcome , Sir .
I thank you , Sir , few words .
I'le kill you for your Uncles sake .
I love you , I'le cut your throat for your own sake .
I esteem of you .
Let 's render 'em honest , and fair , Gentlemen , Search my friend , I'le search yours .
That 's quickly done .
You come with no Spells , nor Witchcrafts ?
I come fairly to kill him honestly .
Hang Spells , and Witchcrafts , I come to kill my Lords Nephew like a Gentleman , And so I kiss his hand .
This Doublet is too stiff .
Off with't , I hate it , And all such fortifications , feel my skin , If that be stiff , flea that off too .
'T is no soft one .
Off with't , I say : I'le fight with him like a flea 'd Cat .
You are well , you are well .
You must uncase too .
Yes , Sir.But tell me this , why should I mix mine honourWith a fellow , that has ne 're a lace in 's shirt ?
That 's a main point , my friend has two .
That 's true , Sir .
Base and degenerate Cousin , dost not thou knowAn old , and tatter 'd colours , to the enemy , Is of more honour , and shews more ominous ? This shirt , five times , victorious I have fought under , And cut through squadrons of your curious cut-works , As I will do through thine , shake , and be satisfied .
This is unanswerable .
But may I fight with a foul shirt ?
Most certain , so it be a fighting shirt , Let it be ne 're so foul , or lowsie , Cæsar wore such a one .
Saint Denis then : I accept your shirt .
Not so forward , first you must talk , 'T is a main point , of the French method , Talk civilly , and make your cause Authentick .
No weapon must be near you , nor no anger .
When you have done , then stir your resolutions , Take to your Weapons bravely .
'T is too cold ; This for a Summer fight .
Not for a world you should transgress the rules .
'T is pievish weather , I had rather fight without .
An 'twere in a River .
Where both stood up to th ' chins .
Then let 's talk quickly , Pl -- -- o ' this circumstance .
Are the Horses come yet ?
Yes certain : give your swords to us , now civilly .
We 'll stand a while off ; take the things , and leave 'em , You know when , and let the children play : This is a dainty time of year for puppies , Would the old Lord were here .
He would dye with laughter .
I am sorry I have no time to see this game out , Away , away .
Here 's like to be a hot fight , Call when y'are fit. [ Ex. Cler. and Gent .
Why look you Sir , you seem to be a Gentleman , And you come in honour of your Uncle , boh , boh , 't is very cold ; Your Uncle has offer 'd me some few affronts , Past flesh and blood to bear : boh , boh , wondrous cold .
My Lord , mine Uncle , is an honourable man , And what he offers , boh , boh , cold indeed , Having made choice of me , an unworthy kinsman , Yet take me with you : boh , boh , pestilence cold , Not altogether .
Boh , boh , I say altogether .
You say you know not what then ? boh , boh , Sir .
Sir me with your sword in your hand ; You have a scurvy Uncle , you have a most scurvy cause , And you are -- boh , boh .
Boh , boh , what ?
A shitten scurvy Cousin .
Our Swords ; our Swords ; Thou art a Dog , and like a Dog , our Swords .
Our weapons Gentlemen : ha ? where 's your second ?
Where 's yours ?
So ho ; our weapons .
Wa , ha , ho , our weapons ; Our Doublets and our weapons , I am dead .
First , second , third , a pl -- -- be wi ' you Gentlemen .
Are these the rules of honour ? I am starv 'd .
They are gone , and we are here ; what shall we do ?
O for a couple of Faggots .
Hang a couple of Faggots.Dar'st thou take a killing cold with me ?
I have it already .
Rogues , Thieves , boh , boh , run away with our Doublets ? To fight at Buffets now , 'twere such a May-game .
There were no honour i n't , pl -- -- o n't , 't is scurvy .
Or to revenge my wrongs at fisty-cuffes .
My Lord , mine Uncles cause , depend on Boxes ?
Let 's go in quest , if we ever recover 'em .
I , come , our Colds together , and our Doublets .
Give me thy hand ; thou art a valiant Gentleman , I say if ever we recover 'em --
Let 's get into a house and warm our hearts .
There 's ne 're a house within this mile , beat me , Kick me and beat me as I go , and I'le beat thee too , To keep us warm ; if ever we recover 'em -- Kick hard , I am frozen : so , so , now I feel it .
I am dull yet .
I'le warm thee , I'le warm thee -- Gentlemen ? Rogues , Thieves , Thieves : run now I'le follow thee. [ Exeunt .
Vertaign , Champernel , Beaupre , Verdone , Lamira , Annabel , Charlote , Nurse .
Use legs , and have legs .
You that have legs say so , I put my one to too much stress .
Your Horse , Sir , Will meet you within half a mile .
I likeThe walk so well , I should not miss my Coach , Though it were further. Annabel thou art sad : What ails my Niece ?
She 's still musing , Sister , How quietly her late bed-fellow lay by her .
Old as I am , he would have startled me , Nor can you blame her .
Had I ta'ne her place , I know not , but I fear , I should ha ' shreek 'd , Though he had never offer 'd --
Out upon thee , Thou wouldst have taught him .
I think , with your pardon , That you wish now you had .
I am glad I yield you [ Cornet.Such ample scope of mirth. [ Musick within .
Nay , be not angry , There 's no ill meant : ha ? Musick , and choice Musick ?
'T is near us in the Grove ; what courteous bountyBestows it on us ? my dancing days are done ; Yet I would thank the giver , did I know him .
'T is questionless , some one of your own Village , That hearing of your purpos 'd journey thither , Prepares it for your entertainment , andThe honour of my Lady .
I think rather , Some of your Lordships Clients .
What say you Cousin , If they should prove your Suitors ?
That 's most likely .
I say if you are noble , be't who will , Go presently and thank 'em : I can jump yet , Or tread a measure .
Like a Millers Mare .
I warrant you well enough to serve the Country , I'le make one , and lead the way. [ Exit .
Do you note , How zealous the old Crone is ?
And you titterAs eagerly as she : come sweet , we 'll follow , No ill can be intended. [ Musick ends .
I ne 're feared yet. [ Exeunt.SONG in the Wood.This way , this way come and hear , You that hold these pleasures dear , Fill your ears with our sweet sound , Whilst we melt the frozen ground : This way come , make haste oh fair , Let your clear eyes gild the Air ; Come and bless us with your sight , This way , this way , seek delight .
They are ours , but draw them on a little furtherFrom the foot-path into the neighbouring thicket , And we may do't , as safe as in a Castle .
They follow still ; the President VertaigneComes on a pace , and Champernel limps after ; The Women , as if they had wings , and walk'tUpon the Air , fly to us .
They are welcome , We 'll make 'em sport ; make a stand here , all knowHow we are to proceed .
We are instructed. [ Still Musick within .
One strain or two more. [ Gent. off .
Vertaigne , Champernel , Beaupre , Verdone , Lamira , Anabel , Nurse , Charlote.Excellent , they are come .
We can not miss , in such a business , yetMine ear ne'r fail 'd me. [ Musick for the Dance .
Would we were at it once , I do not walk , but Dance .
You shall have dancing.Begin , and when I give the word --
No more : We are instructed. [ Dance .
But win us fairly --
O Sir , we do not come to try your valour , But to possess you , yet we use you kindlyIn that , like English Thieves , we kill you not , But are contented with the spoil .
Oh Heaven ! How hath mine age deserv 'd this ?
Hell confound it , This comes of walking ; had I kept my legs , Or my good Horse , my Armour on , My Staff in my rest , and this good Sword too , friend , How I would break and scatter these .
Ha , ha , ha .
Do you scorn me Rogues ?
Nay , Gentlemen , kind Gentlemen , Or honest keepers of these woods , but hear me , Be not so rough ; if you are taken withMy beauty , as it hath been worth the seeking , Some one or two of you try me in private , You shall not find me squeamish .
Do not kill me , And do your worst , I'le suffer .
Peace vile creatures .
Do you know me , or my place , that you presume notTo touch my person ?
If you are well , rest so , Provoke not angry Wasps .
You are Wasps indeed , Never created to yield Wax or Honey , But for your Countries torment ; yet if you are men , ( As you seem such in shape ) if true born French-men , However want compels you to these courses , Rest satisfied with what you can take from us , ( These Ladies honours , and our liberties safe ) We freely give it .
You give but our own .
Look on these grey hairs , as you would be old , Their tears , as you would have yours to find mercyWhen Justice shall o'retake you .
Look on me , Look on me Rascals , and learn of me too , That have been in some part of your profession , Before that most of you ere suck 'd , I know it , I have rode hard , and late too .
Take heed , Sir .
Then use me like a Brother of the Trade , For I have been at Sea , as you on land are , Restore my Matrimony undefil 'd , Wrong not my Neece , and for our gold or silver , If I pursue you , hang me .
'T is well offer 'd , And as I said , sweet Gentlemen , with sowre faces , If you are high , and want some sport , or so , ( As living without action here , you may do ) Forbear their tender grissels , they are meatWill wash away , there is no substance in it , We that are expert in the game , and tough too , Will hold you play .
Dinant and Cleremont .
This Hen longs to be troden .
Lackey , my Horse .
This way , I heard the criesOf distress 'd Women .
Stand upon your guard .
Who 's here ? my witty , scornful Lady-plotIn the hands of Ruffians ?
And my fine cold virgin , That was insensible of man , and woman ?
Justice too , Without a sword to guard it self ?
And valour with its hands bound ?
And the great Souldier dull ? Why this is strange .
Dinant as thou art noble --
As thou art valiant Cleremont --
As ever I appear 'd lovely --
As you ever hopeFor what I would give gladly --
Pretty conjurations .
All injuries a little laid behind you .
Shew your selves men , and help us .
Though your manyAnd gross abuses of me should more move meTo triumph in your miseries than relieve you , -- Yet that hereafter you may know that IThe scorn 'd and despis 'd Dinant , know what doesBelong to honour , thus --
I will say little , [ Fight.Speak thou for me .
'T is bravely fought .
Brave tempers , To do thus for their enemies .
They are lost yet .
You that would rescue others , shall now feelWhat they were born to .
Hurry them away. [ Ex. Manent Vert. and Champernel .
That I could follow them .
I only can lament my fortune , and desire of heavenA little life for my revenge .
The ProvostShall fire the woods , but I will find 'em out , No cave , no rock , nor hell shall keep them fromMy searching vengeance .
La-writ , and Sampson .
O cold ! O fearfull cold ! plague of all seconds .
O for a pint of burnt wine , or a sipOf aqua-fortis .
The rogues have met with these twoUpon my life and rob 'd 'em .
As you are honourable Gentlemen , Impart unto a couple of cold combatants .
My Lord , mine uncle as I live .
Pox take him.How that word has warm 'd my mouth !
Why how now Cousin ? Why , why ? and where man , have you been ? at a PoultersThat you are cas 'd thus like a rabbet ? I could laugh now , And I shall laugh , for all I have lost my Children , Laugh monstrously .
What are they ?
Give me leave Sir , Laugh more and more , never leave laughing .
Why Sir ?
Why 't is such a thing I smell it Sir , I smell it , Such a ridiculous thing , --
Do you laugh at me my Lord ? I am very cold , but that should not be laught at .
What art thou ?
What art thou ?
If he had his doublet. -- And his sword by his side , as a Gentleman ought to have .
Peace Monsieur Sampson .
Come hither little Gentleman .
Base is the slave commanded : come to me .
This is the little advocate .
What advocate ?
The little advocate that sent me a challenge , I told you that my Nephew undertook it , And what 't was like to prove : now you see the issue .
Is this the little Lawyer ?
You have a sword Sir , And I have none , you have a doublet tooThat keeps you warm , and makes you merry .
If your Lordship knewThe nature , and the nobleness of the Gentleman , Though he shew slight here , and at what gusts of dangerHis manhood has arrived , But thatMens fates are foolish , And often headlong overrun their fortunes .
That little Lawyer would so prick his ears up , And bite your honour by the nose .
Say you so Sir ?
So niggle about your grave shins Lord Verta [ ig ] ne too .
No more sweet Gentleman , no more of that Sir .
I will have more , I must have more .
Out with it .
Nay he is as brave a fellow. --
Have I caught you ? [ Strikes him down .
Do not kill him , do not kill him .
No , no , no , I will not. Do you peep again ? Down down proud heart .
O valour , Look up brave friend , I have no means to rescue thee , My Kingdom for a sword .
I'le sword you presently , I'le claw your skin coat too .
Away good Sampson , You go to grass else instantly .
But do not murder my brave friend .
Not one word .
If you do sirra --
Must I goe off dishonour 'd ? Adversity tries valour , so I leave thee. [ Exit .
Are you a Lawyer Sir ?
I was , I was Sir .
Nay never look , your Lawyers pate is broken , And your litigious blood about your ears sirra , Why do you fight and snarle ?
I was possest .
I'le dispossess you .
Ha , ha , ha .
Et tu Brute ?
Beat him no more .
Alas Sir I must beat him , Beat him into his business again , he will be lost else .
Then take your way .
Ly still , and doe not struggle .
I am patient , I never saw my blood before , it jades me , I have no more heart now than a goose .
Why sirra , why do you leave your trade , your trade of living , And send your challenges like thunderbolts , To men of honour 'd place ?
I understand Sir , I never understood before your beating .
Does this work on you ?
Yes .
Do you thank me for't ?
As well as a beaten man can .
And do you promise me , To fall close to your trade again ? leave brawling ?
If you will give me leave and life .
And ask this noble man forgiveness ?
Heartily .
Rise then , and get you gone , and let me hear of youAs of an advocate new vampt ; no more words , Get you off quickly , and make no murmurs , I shall pursue you else .
I have done sweet Gentlemen. [ Exit .
But we forget our selves , our friends and Children .
We'l raise the country first , then take our fortunes. [ Exeunt .
Gentleman , and Lamira .
Shall I entreat for what I may command ?
Think on my birth .
Here I am only Noble , A King , and thou in my dominions , fool , A subject and a slave .
Be not a Tyrant , A ravisher of honour , gentle Sir , And I will think ye such , and on my knees , As to my Soveraign , pay a Subjects duty , With prayers and tears .
I like this humble carriage , I will walk by , but kneel you still and weep too , It shews well , while I meditate on the prey , Before I seize it .
Is there no mercie , Heaven ?
Gent. and Anabel .
Not kiss you ? I will kiss and kiss again .
Savage villain ! My Innocence be my strength , I do defie thee , Thus scorn and spit at thee ; will you come on Sir ? You are hot , there is a cooler .
A virago ?
No , loathsome Goat , more , more , I am that Goddess , That here with whips of steel in hell hereafterScourge rape and theft .
I'le try your deity .
My chastity , and this knife held by a Virgin , Against thy lust , thy sword and thee a Beast , Call on for the encounter .
Now what think you ? [ Throws her and taks her Knife.Are you a Goddess ?
In me their power suffers , That should protect the Innocent .
I am all fire , And thou shall quench it , and serve my pleasures.Come partner in the spoil and the reward , Let us enjoy our purchase .
O Dinant ! O Heaven ! O Husband !
O my Cleremont !
Two are our slaves they call on , bring 'em forthAs they are chain 'd together , let them seeAnd suffer in the object .
Dinant , and Cleremont , bound by the rest of theGent .
While we sitAnd without pity hear 'em .
By my life , I suffer more for thee than for my self .
Be a man Cleremont , and look upon 'emAs such that not alone abus 'd our service , Fed us with hopes most bitter in digestion , But when love fail 'd , to draw on further mischief , The baits they laid for us , were our own honours , Which thus hath made us slaves too , worse than slaves .
He dies .
Pray hold , give him a little respite .
I see you now beyond expression wretched , The wit you brag 'd of fool 'd , that boasted honour , As you believ 'd compass 'd with walls of brass , To guard it sure , subject to be o'rethrownWith the least blast of lust .
A most sad truth .
That confidence which was not to be shakenIn a perpetual fever , and those favours , Which with so strong and Ceremonious dutyYour lover and a Gentleman long sought for , Sought , sued , and kneel 'd in vain for , must you yield upTo a licentious villain , that will hardlyAllow you thanks for't .
Something I must say too , And to you pretty one , though crying one ; To be hang 'd now , when these worshipful benchers please , Though I know not their faces that condemn me , A little startles me , but a man is nothing , A Maidenhead is the thing , the thing all aim at ; Do not you wish now , and wish from your heart too , When scarce sweet with my fears , I long lay by youThose fears you and your good Aunt put upon me , To make you sport , you had given a little hint , A touch or so , to tell me I was mortal , And by a mortal woman ?
Pray you no more .
If I had loos 'd that virgin Zone , observe me , I would have hired the best of all our PoetsTo have sung so much , and so well in the honourOf that nights joy , that Ovids afternoon , Nor his Corinna should again be mention 'd .
I do repent , and wish I had .
That 's comfort , But now --
Another that will have it offer 'd , Compel it to be offer 'd , shall enjoy it .
A rogue , a ruffian .
As you love your throat , --
Away with them .
O Cleremont !
O Dinant !
I can but add your sorrows to my sorrows , Your fears to my fears .
To your wishes mine , This slave may prove unable to perform , Till I perform the task that I was born for .
Amen , amen .
Drag the slaves hence , for youA while I'le lock you up here , study all waysYou can to please me , or the deed being done , You are but dead .
This strong Vault shall contain you , There think how many for your maidenheadHave pin 'd away , and be prepar 'd to lose itWith penitence .
No humane help can save you .
Help , help !
You cry in vain , rocks can not hear you .
A Horrid noise of Musique within,
Lamira andAnabel were shut , they in all fear .
O Cousin how I shake all this long night ! What frights and noises we have heard , still they encrease , The villains put on shapes to torture us , And to their Devils form such preparationsAs if they were a hatching new dishonours , And fatal ruine , past dull mans invention.Goe not too far , and pray good Cousin Anabel , Hark a new noise. [ A strange Musick. Sackbut & Troop Musick .
They are exquisite in mischief , I will goe on , this room gives no protection , More than the next , what 's that ? how sad and hollow , The sound comes to us. [ Thieves peeping. Louder .
Groaning ? or singing is it ?
The wind I think , murmuring amongst old rooms .
Now it grows lowder , sure some sad presageOf our foul loss -- look now they peep .
Pox peep 'em .
O give them gentle language .
Give 'em rats-bane. [ Peep above .
Now they are above .
I would they were i'th ' Center .
Thou art so foolish desperate .
Since we must lose .
Call 'em brave fellows , Gentlemen .
Call 'em rogues , Rogues as they are , rude rogues , uncivil villains .
Look an thou woo't beware , dost thou feel the danger ?
Till the danger feel me , thus will I talk still , And worse when that comes too ; they can not eat me.This is a punishment , upon our own pridesMost justly laid ; we must abuse brave Gentlemen , Make 'em tame fools , and hobby-horses , laugh and jear atSuch men too , and so handsom and so Noble , That howsoe 're we seem 'd to carry it -- Wou 'd 'twere to do again .
I do confess cousin , I was too harsh , too foolish .
Do you feel it ? Do you find it now ? take heed o'th ' punishment , We might have had two gallant Gentlemen , Proper , young , O how it tortures me ! Two Devils now , two rascals , two and twenty --
O think not so .
Nay an we 'scape so modestly --
May we be worthy any eyes , or knowledge , When we are used thus ?
Why not ? why do you cry ? Are we not women still ? what were we made for ?
But thus , thus basely --
'T is against our [ w ] ills , And if there come a thousand so , --
Out on thee .
You are a fool , what we can not resist , Why should we grieve and blush for ? there be women , And they that bear the name of excellent womenWould give their whole estates to meet this fortune .
Hark , a new noise. [ New sound within .
Let 'em goe on , I fear not , If wrangling , fighting and scratching can not preserve me , Why so be it Cousin ; if I be ordain'dTo breed a race of rogues. --

Be firm , They are welcom .
What mask of death is this ? O my dear Brother .
My Couz too ; why now y'are glorious villains .
O shall we lose our honours ?
Let 'em goe , When death prepares the way , they are but Pageants.Why must these dye ?
Lament your own misfortunes , We perish happily before your ruins .
Has mischief ne'r a tongue ?
Yes foolish woman , Our Captains will is death .
You dare not do it.Tell thy base boisterous Captain what I say , Thy lawless Captain that he dares not ; Do you laugh you rogue ? you pamper 'd rogue ?
Good Sir , Good Cousin gently , as y'are a Gentleman , --
A Gentleman ? a slave , a dog , the devils harbinger .
Sir as you had a Mother .
He a Mother ? Shame not the name of Mother , a she BearA bloody old wolf bitch , a woman Mother ? Looks that rude lump , as if he had a Mother ? Intreat him ? hang him , do thy worst , thou dar'st not , Thou dar'st not wrong their lives , thy Captain dares not , They are persons of more price .
What e 're we sufferLet not your angers wrong you .
You can not suffer , The men that do this deed , must live i'th ' moonFree from the gripe of Justice .
Is it not better ?
Is it not better ? let 'em goe on like rascalsAnd put false faces on ; they dare not do it ; Flatter such scabbs of nature ?
Woman , womanThe next work is with you .
Unbind those Gentlemen , And put their fatal fortunes on our necks .
As you have mercy do .
As you are monsters .
Fright us no more with shipwrack of our honoursNor if there be a guilt by us committedLet it endanger those .
I say they dare not , There be a thousand gallouses , ye rogues , Tortures , ye bloody rogues , wheels .

Now stand constant , For now our tryal 's come .
This beautie 's mine , Your minute moves not yet .
She sinks if Christian , If any spark of noble heat. --
Rise LadyAnd fearless rise , there 's no dishonour meant you , Do you know my tongue ?
I have heard it .
Mark it better , I am one that loves you , fairly , nobly loves you , Look on my face ?
O Sir ?
No more words , softlyHark , but hark wisely how , understand well , Suspect not , fear not .
You have brought me comfort .
If you think me worthy of your husband , I am no rogue nor Begger , if you dare do thus --
You are Monsieur Cleremont .
I am the same , If you dare venture , speak , if not I leave you , And leave you to the mercy of these villainsThat will not wooe ye much .
Save my reputation , And free me from these slaves .
By this kiss I'le do it , And from the least dishonour they dare aim at you , I have a Priest too , shall be ready .
You are forward .
Is this my constant cousin ? how she whispers , Kisses and huggs the thief !
You'l offer nothing .
Till all be tyed , Not as I am a Gentleman .
Can you relieve my Aunt too ?
Not yet Mistris , But fear nothing , all shall be well , away quicklyIt must be done i'th ' moment or --
I am with ye .
I'le know now who sleeps by me , keep your standing. [ Ex. Cler. and Anabel .
Well , go thy way , and thine own shame dwell with thee.Is this the constancy she shew 'd , the bravery ? The dear love and the life she ow 'd her kinsmen ? O brave tongue , valiant glorious woman ! Is this the noble anger you arriv 'd at ? Are these the thieves you scorn 'd , the rogues you rail 'd at ? The scabs and scums of nature ? O fair modesty , Excellent vertue , whither art thou fled ? What hand O Heaven is over us , when strong virginsYield to their fears , and to their fears their fortunes ? Never belief come near me more , farewel wench , A long farewel from all that ever knew thee : My turn is next , I am resolv 'd , it comesBut in a nobler shape , ha ?
Dinant .
Blesse ye Lady .
Indeed Sir , I had need of many blessings , For all the hours I have had since I came here , Have been so many curses. How got you liberty ? For I presume you come to comfort me .
To comfort you , and love you , 't is most true , My bondage was as yours , as full of bitternessAnd every hour my death .
Heaven was your comfort .
Till the last evening , sitting full of sadness , Wailing , sweet Mistris , your unhappy fortunes , ( Mine own I had the least care of ) round about meThe Captain and the company stood gaping , When I began the story of my loveTo you fair Saint , and with so full a sorrow , Follow 'd each point , that even from those rude eyes , That never knew what pity meant or mercy , There stole down soft relentings : take heed Mistris , And let not such unholy hearts outdo you , The soft plum 'd god will see again ; thus taken , As men transform 'd with the strange tale I told , They stood amaz 'd , then bid me rise and live , Take liberty and means to see your person , And wisht me prosperous in your love , wish you so , Be wise and loving Lady , shew but you so .
O Sir , are these fit hours to talk of love in ? Shall we make fools of our afflictions ? Can any thing sound sweetly in mine ears , Where all the noise of bloody horrour is ? My Brother , and my Cousin , they are dead Sir , Dead , basely dead , is this an age to fool in ? And I my self , I know not what I shall be , Yet I must thank you , and if happilyYou had ask 'd me yesterday , when these were living , And my fears less , I might have hearkned to you .
Peace to your grief , I bind you to your word .
Cleremont , Anabel , Beaupre , Verdone , Charlote,
How ? do you conjure ?
Not to raise dreadfull apparitions , Madam , But such as you would gladly see .
My Brother , and nephew living ?
And both owe their livesTo the favour of these Gentlemen .
Who deserveOur service , and for us , your gracious thanks .
Which I give freely , and become a suitor , To be hereafter more familiar [ Kisse.With such great worth and vertue .
Ever think usYour servants , Madam .
Why if thou wilt needs knowHow we are freed , I will discover it , And with laconick brevity : these GentlemenThis night incountring with those outlaws thatYesterday made us prisoners , and as we wereAttempted by 'em they with greater courage , ( I am sure with better fortune ) not alone , Guarded themselves , but forc 'd the bloody thieves , Being got between them , and this hellish Cave , For safety of their lives , to fly up higherInto the woods , all left to their possession , This sav 'd your Brother , and your nephew fromThe gibbet , this redeem 'd me from my Chains , And gave my friend his liberty , this preserv'dYour honour ready to be lost .
But thatI know this for a ly , and that the thievesAnd gentlemen , are the same men , by my practiceSuborn 'd to this , he does deliver itWith such a constant brow , that I am doubtfull , I should believe him too .
If we did well , We are rewarded .
Thanks but takes awayFrom what was freely purpos 'd .
Now by this hand , You have so cunningly discharg 'd your parts , That while we live , rest confident you shallCommand Dinant and Cleremont ; nor Beaupre , Nor Verdone scents it : for the Ladies , theyWere easie to be gull 'd .
'T was but a jest , And yet the jest may chance to break our necksShould it be known .
Fear nothing .
Cleremont , Say , what success ?
As thou wouldst wish , 't is done Lad , The grove will witness with me , that this nightI lay not like a block : but how speed you ?
I yet am in suspence , devise some meansTo get these off , and speedily .
I have it , Come , we are dull , I think that the good fellows , Our predecessors in this place , were notSo foolish , and improvident husbands , but'Twill yield us meat and wine .
Let 's ransack it , 'T is ours now by the Law .
How say you sweet one , Have you an appetite ?
To walk againI'th ' Woods , if you think fit , rather than eat .
A little respite prethee ; nay blush not , You ask but what 's your own , and warrantable:
, Beaupre , Verdone , What think you of the motion ?
Lead the way .
We follow willingly. [ Ex. Man. Din. and Lam .
When you shall think fit , We will expect you .
Now be mistris ofYour promise Lady .
'T was to give you hearing .
But that word hearing , did include a grant , And you must make it good .
Must ?
Must and shall , I will be fool 'd no more , you had your tricks ; Made properties of me , and of my friend ; Presum 'd upon your power , and whip 'd me withThe rod of mine own dotage : do not flatterYour self with hope , that any humane helpCan free you , and for aid by miracleA base unthankfull woman is unworthy .
You will not force me ?
Rather than enjoy youWith your consent , because I will torment you ; I'le make you feel the effects of abus 'd love , And glory in your torture .
Brother , Nephew , Help , help , for Heavens sake .
Tear your throat , cry louder , Though every leaf , these trees bear , were an Echo , And summon 'd in your best friends to redeem you , It should be fruitless : 't is not that I love you , Or value those delights you prize so high , That I'le enjoy you , a French crown will buyMore sport , and a companion , to whom , You in your best trim are an Ethiop .
Forbear me then .
Not so , I'le do't in spite , And break that stubborn disobedient will , That hath so long held out , that boasted honourI will make equal with a common Whores ; The spring of Chastity , that fed your pride , And grew into a River of vain glory , I will defile with mudd , the mudd of lust , And make it loathsome even to goats .
O Heaven ! No pity Sir ?
You taught me to be cruel , And dare you think of mercy ? I'le tell thee fool , Those that surpriz 'd thee , were my instruments , I can plot too good Madam , you shall find it : And in the stead of licking of my fingers , Kneeling and whining like a boy new breech 'd , To get a toy forsooth , not worth an apple , Thus make my way , and with AuthorityCommand what I would have .
I am lost for ever : Good Sir , I do confess my fault , my gross fault , And yield my self up , miserable guilty ; Thus kneeling I confess , you can not studySufficient punishments to load me with ; I am in your power , and I confess again , You can not be too cruel : if there be , Besides the loss of my long guarded honour , Any thing else to make the ballance even , Pray put it in , all hopes , all helpes have left me ; I am girt round with sorrow , hell 's about me , And ravishment the least that I can look for , Do what you please .
Indeed I will do nothing , Nor touch nor hurt you Lady , nor had everSuch a lewd purpose .
Can there be such goodness , And in a man so injur 'd ?
Be confirm 'd in't.I seal it thus : I must confess you vex 'd me , In fooling me so often , and those fearsYou threw upon me call 'd for a requital , Which now I have return 'd , all unchast love
thus throws away ; live to man-kind , As you have done to me , and I will honourYour vertue , and no more think of your beauty .
All I possess , comes short of satisfaction .
No complements : the terrours of this nightImagine but a fearfull dream , and soWith ease forget it : for Dinant , that labour'dTo blast your honour , is a Champion for it , And will protect and guard it .
'T is as safe then , As if a compleat Army undertook it. [ Exeunt .
La-writ , Sampson , Clyents .
Do not perswade me gentle Monsieur Sampson , I am a mortal man again , a Lawyer , My martiall part I have put off .
Sweet Monsieur , Let but our honours teach us .
Monsieur Sampson , My honourable friend , my valiant friend , Be but so beaten , forward my brave Clients , I am yours , and you are mine again , be but so thrasht , Receive that Castigation with a cudgel .
Which calls upon us for a Reparation .
I have , it cost me half a crown , I bear itAll over me , I bear it Monsieur Sampson ; The oyls , and the old woman that repairs to me , To 'noint my beaten body .
It concerns you , You have been swing 'd .
Let it concern thee too ; Goe and be beaten , speak scurvy words , as I did , Speak to that Lion Lord , waken his anger , And have a hundred Bastinado 's , doe ; Three broken pates , thy teeth knockt out , do Sampson , Thy valiant arms and leggs beaten to Poultesses , Do silly Sampson , do .
You wrong the Gentleman , To put him out of his right mind thus : You wrong us , and our Causes .
Down with him Gentlemen , Turn him , and beat him , if he break our peace , Then when thou hast been Lam 'd , thy small guts perisht , Then talk to me , before I scorn thy counsel , Feel what I feel , and let my Lord repair thee .
And can the brave La-writ --
Tempt him no further , Be warn 'd and say no more .
If thou doest , Sampson , Thou seest my Mirmidons , I'le let 'em loose , That in a moment --
I say nothing , Sir , but I could wish --
They shall destroy thee wishing ; There 's ne'r a man of these , but have lost ten causes , Dearer then ten mens lives ; tempt , and thou diest : Goe home , and smile upon my Lord , thine Uncle , Take Mony of the men thou mean'st to Cousin , Drink Wine , and eat good meat , and live discreetly , Talk little , 't is an antidote against a beating ; Keep thy hand from thy sword , and from thy Laundress placket , And thou wilt live long .
Give ear , and be instructed .
I find I am wiser than a Justice of Peace now , Give me the wisdom that 's beaten into a manThat sticks still by him : art thou a new man ?
Yes , yes , Thy learned precepts have inchanted me .
Goe my son Sampson , I have now begot thee , I'le send thee causes ; speak to thy Lord , and live , And lay my share by , goe and live in peace , Put on new suits , and shew fit for thy place ; That man neglects his living , is an Asse : [ Exit Samp.Farewel ; come chearily boyes , about our business , Now welcom tongue again , hang Swords .
Sweet Advocate. [ Exeunt .
Nurse , and Charlote .
I know not wench , they may call 'em what they will , Outlawes , or thieves , but I am sure , to meOne was an honest man , he us 'd me well , What I did , 't is no matter , he complain 'd not .
I must confess , there was one bold with me too , Some coy thing would say rude , but 't is no matter , I was to pay a Waiting womans ransom , And I have do n't , and I would pay't again , Were I ta'n to morrow .
Alas , there was no hurt , If 't be a sin for such as live at hard meat , And keep a long Lent , in the woods as they do , To taste a little flesh .
God help the Courtiers , That lye at rack and manger .
I shall loveA thief the better for this while I live , They are men of a charitable vocation , And give where there is need , and with discretion , And put a good speed penny in my purse , That has been empty twenty years .
Peace Nurse , Farewel , and cry not rost meat , me thinks CleremontAnd my Lady Anabel are in one night , Familiarly acquainted .
I observe it , If she have got a penny too .
Vertaign , Champernel , and Provost .
No more , My Lord Monsieur Vertaigne , the provost too , Haste and acquaint my Lady. [ Ex. Nur. and Char .
Wonderous strange .
'T is true Sir , on my credit .
O mine honour .
I have been provost-Marshal twenty years , And have trussed up a thousand of these rascals , But so near Paris yet I never met withOne of that Brotherhood .
We to our cost have , But will you search the wood ?
It is beset , They can not scape us , nothing makes me wonder , So much as having you within their powerThey let you goe ; it was a Courtesy , That French thieves use not often , I much pityThe Gentle Ladies , yet I know not how , I rather hope than fear .
Dinant , Cleremont , Verdone , Beaupre , Lamira , Anabel , Charlote , Nurse.Are these the prisoners ?
We were such .
Kill me not , excess of joy .
I see thou livest , but hast thou had no foul play ?
No on my soul , my usage hath been noble , Far from all violence .
How were you freed ? But kiss me first , we'l talk of that at leasure , I am glad I have thee ; Niece how you keep off , As you knew me not ?
Sir , I am whereI owe most duty .
'T is indeed most true Sir , The man that should have been your bedfellowYour Lordships bedfellow , that could not smell outA Virgin of sixteen , that was your fool , To make you merry , this poor simple fellowHas met the maid again , and now she knowsHe is a man .
How ! is she dishonoured ?
Not unless marriage be dishonourable , Heaven is a witness of our happy contract , And the next Priest we meet shall warrant itTo all the world : I lay with her in jeast , 'T is turn 'd to earnest now .
Is this true , Niece ?
Her blushing silence grants it ; nay Sir storm not , He is my friend , and I can make this good , His birth and fortunes equal hers , your LordshipMight have sought out a worse , we are all friends too , All differences end thus. Now Sir , unlessYou would raise new dissentions , make perfectWhat is so well begun .
That were not manly .
Let me perswade you .
Well God give you joy , She shall not come a Begger to you Sir.For you Monsieur Dinant 'ere long I'le shew youAnother Niece , to this not much inferiour , As you shall like proceed .
I thank you Sir .

Health to my Soveraign .
Eumenes , welcome : Welcome to Paphos , Souldier , to our love , And that fair health ye wish us , through the CampMay it disperse it self , and make all happy ; How does the General , the valiant Memnon , And how his Wars , Eumenes ?
The Gods have giv'n you ( Royal Sir ) a Souldier , Better ne 're sought a danger , more approv'dIn way of War , more master of his fortunes , Expert in leading 'em ; in doing valiant , In following all his deeds to Victories , And holding fortune certain there .
O Souldier , Thou speak'st a man indeed ; a Generals General , A soul conceiv 'd a Souldier .
Ten set BattelsAgainst the strong usurper Diocles ( Whom long experience had begot a Leader , Ambition rais 'd too mighty ) hath your MemnonWon , and won gloriously , distrest and shook himEven from the head of all his hopes to nothing : In three , he beat the Thunder-bolt his Brother , Forc 'd him to wall himself up : there not safe , Shook him with warlike Engins like an Earthquake , Till like a Snail he left his shell and crawl'dBy night and hideous darkness to destruction : Disarm 'd for ever rising more : Twelve Castles , Some thought impregnable ; Towns twice as many ; Countries that like the wind knew no commandBut savage wildness , hath this GeneralWith loss of blood and youth , through Storms and TempestsCall 'd to your fair obedience .
O my SouldierThat thou wert now within my arms ; what drums { DrumsAre those that beat Eumenes ? { within .
His , my Soveraign ; Himself i'th ' head of conquest drawing home , An old man now to offer up his glories , And endless conquest at your shrine .
Goe all , And entertain him with all Ceremonie , We'l keep him now a Courtier .
Sir , a strange one , Pray God his language bear it ; by my life , SirHe knows no complement , nor curious castingOf words into fit places e 're he speak 'em , He can say fight well fellow , and I'le thank thee : He that must eat , must fight ; bring up the rear there , Or charge that wing of horse home. [ Flourish .
Goe too , goe too .
Memnon , and a train of Courtiers , and Souldiers , two Captains , Chilax.Valiant and wise are twins Sir : welcom , welcom , Welcom my fortunate and famous General , High in thy Princes favour , as in fame , Welcom to Peace , and Paphos .
No more wars my Souldier : { K. takes Mem. asideWe must now treat of peace Sir. { and talks with him .
How he talks , How gloriously .
A goodly timber 'd fellow , Valiant no doubt .
If valour dwell in vaunting ; In what a phrase he speaks , as if his actionsCould be set off in nothing but a noise ; Sure h'as a drum in 's mouth .
I wonder wenchesHow he would speak to us .
Nothing but Larum , Tell us whose throat he cut , shew us his sword , And bless it for sure biting .
And 't like your Grace , I do not think he knows us what we are , Or to what end ; for I have heard his followersAffirm he never saw a woman that exceededA Sutlers wife yet , or in executionOld bedrid Beldames without teeth or tongues , That would not flie his furie ? how he looks .
This way devoutly .
Sure his Lordship 's viewingOur Fortifications .
If he mount at me , I may chance choak his Battery .
Still his eyeKeeps quarter this way : Venus grant his valourBe not in love .
If he be , presentlyExpect a Herald and a Trumpet with yeTo bid ye render ; we two Perdu 's pay for't else .
I'le leave ye to my sister , and these LadiesTo make your welcom fuller : my good souldierWe must now turn your sternness into Courtship ; When ye have done there , to your fair repose Sir : [ Flourish.I know you need it Memnon ; welcom Gentlemen. [ Exit King .
Now he begins to march : Madam the Van 's yours , Keep your ground sure ; 't is for your spurrs .
O Venus. { { He kneels amaz'd,
How he stares on me. { and forgets to speak .
Knight him Madam , knight him , He will grow toth ' ground else .
Speak Sir , 't is the Princess .
Ye shame your self , speak to her .
Rise and speak Sir.Ye are welcome to the Court , to me , to all Sir .
Is he not deaf ?
The Gentleman 's not well .
Fie noble General .
Give him fresh air , his colour goes , how do ye ? The Princess will be glad Sir .
Peace , and hear me .
Command a silence there .
I love thee Lady .
I thank your Lordship heartily : proceed Sir .
Lord how it stuck in 's stomach like a surfeit .
It breaks apace now from him , God be thanked , What a fine spoken man he is .
A choice one , of singular variety in carriage .
Yes and I warrant you he knows his distance .
With all my heart I love thee .
A hearty Gentleman , And I were e'en an arrant beast , my Lord , But I lov 'd you again .
Good Lady kiss me .
I marry , Mars , there thou cam'st close up to her .
Kiss you at first my Lord ? 't is no fair fashion , Our lips are like Rose buds , blown with mens breaths , They lose both sap and savour ; there 's my hand Sir .
Fie , fie , my Lord , this is too rude .
Unhand me , Consume me if I hurt her ; good sweet LadyLet me but look upon thee .
Doe .
Yet --
Well Sir , Take your full view .
Bless your eyes Sir .
Mercy , Is this the man they talkt of for a Souldier , So absolute and Excellent : O the Gods , If I were given to that vanitieOf making sport with men for ignorance , What a most precious subject had I purchas 'd ! Speak for him Gentlemen : some one that knows , What the man ails ; and can speak sense .
Sure Madam , This fellow has been a rare Hare finder.See how his eyes are set .
Some one goe with me , I'le send him something for his head , poor Gentleman , He 's troubled with the staggers .
Keep him dark , He will run March mad else , the fumes of BattelsAscend into his brains .
Clap to his feetAn old Drum head , to draw the thunder downward .
Look to him Gentlemen : farewel , Lord I am sorryWe can not kiss at this time , but believe itWe'l find an hour for all : God keep my Children , From being such sweet Souldiers ; Softly wenches , Lest we disturb his dream. [ Exeunt Calis and Ladies .
Why this is Monstrous .
A strange forgetfulness , yet still he holds it .
Though he ne 're saw a woman of great fashionBefore this day , yet methinks 't is possibleHe might imagine what they are , and whatBelongs unto 'em : meer report of others .
Pish , his head had other whimsies i n't : my Lord , Death I think y'are struck dumb ; my good Lord General .
Sir .
That I do love ye Madam ; and so love yeA n't like your grace .
He has been studying this speech .
Who do ye speak to Sir ?
Why where 's the Lady , The woman , the fair woman ?
Who ?
The Princess , Give me the Princess .
Give ye counsel ratherTo use her like a Princess : Fy my Lord , How have you born your self , how nakedl [ y ] Laid your soul open , and your ignoranceTo be a sport to all. Report and honourDrew her to doe you favours , and you bluntly , Without considering what , or who she was , Neither collecting reason , nor distinction .
Why , what did I my Masters ?
All that shewsA man unhandsom , undigested dough .
Did not I kneel unto her ?
Dumb and sensless , As though ye had been cut out for your fathers tomb , Or stuck a land-mark ; when she spoke unto you , Being the excellence of all our Island , Ye star 'd upon her , as ye had seen a monster .
Was I so foolish ? I confess Eumenes , I never saw before so brave an outside , But did I kneel so long ?
Till they laught at ye , And when you spoke I am asham 'd to tell yeWhat 't was my Lord ; how far from order ; Bless me , is't possible the wild noise of warAnd what she only teaches should possess ye ? Knowledge to treat with her , and full discretionBeing at flood still in ye : and in peace , And manly conversation smooth and civil , Where gracefulness and glory twyn together , Thrust your self out an exile ? Do you know Sir , what state she carries ? What great obedience waits at her beck continually ?
She ne 're commandedA hundred thousand men , as I have done , Nor ne 're won battel ; Say I would have kist her .
There was a dainty offer too , a rare one .
Why , she is a woman , is she not ?
She is so .
Why , very well ; what was she made for then ? Is she not young , and handsom , bred to breed ? Do not men kiss fair women ? if they doe , If lips be not unlawfull ware ; Why a PrincessIs got the same way that we get a beggerOr I am cozen 'd ; and the self-same wayShe must be handled e 're she get another , That 's rudeness is it not ?
To her 't is held so , & rudeness in that high degree --
'T is reason , But I will be more punctual ; pray what thought she ?
Her thoughts were merciful , but she laught at ye , Pitying the poorness of your complement , And so she left ye. Good Sir shape your selfTo understand the place , and noble personsYou live with now .
Let not those great desertsThe King hath laid up of ye , and the people , Be blasted with ill bearing .
The whole name of souldier then will suffer .
She 's a sweet one , And good sirs leave your exhortations , They come untimely to me , I have brainsThat beat above your reaches : She 's a Princess , That 's all : I have killed a King , that 's greater.Come let 's to dinner , if the Wine be good , You shall perceive strange wisdom in my blood. [ Exeunt all but Chilax .
Fool , and Page .
Brave Lieutenant .
Hail to the man of worship .
You are fine sirs , Most passing fine at all points .
As ye see Sir , Home-bred and handsome , we cut not out our clothes SirAt half sword as your Taylors doe , and pink 'emWith Pikes and Partizans , we live retir 'd SirGentlemen like , and jealous of our honours .
Very fine Fool , and fine Boy , Peace playes with you , As the wind playes with Feathers , dances ye , You grind with all gusts , gallants .
We can bounce Sir , When you Soldados bend i'th ' hams , and frisk too .
When twenty of your trip-coats turn their tippets , And your cold sallets without salt or vinegerBe wambling in your stomachs ; hemp and hobnailsWill bear no price now , hangings and old harnessAre like to over-run us .
Whores and hot houses .
Surgeons and Syringes ring out your sance-bells .
Your Jubile , your Jubile .
Prob Deum.How our St. Georges will bestride the Dragons , The red and ramping Dragons .
Advanc't fool --
But then the sting i'th ' tail boy .
Tanto Melior.For so much the more danger , the more honour .
You 're very pleasant with our occupation Gent.Which very like amongst these fierie SerpentsMay light upon a Blind-worm of your blood , A Mother or a Sister .
Mine 's past saddle , You should be sure of her else : but say Sir Huon , Now the Drums dubbs , and the sticks turn 'd bed-staves , All the old Foxes hunted to their holes , The Iron age return 'd to Erebus , And HonorificabilitudinitatibusThrust out o'th ' Kingdom by the head and shoulders , What trade do you mean to follow ?
That 's a question .
Yes and a learned question if ye mark it , Consider and say on .
Fooling as thou dost , that 's the best trade I take it .
Take it straight thenFor fear your fellows be before ye , hark ye LieutenantFooling 's the thing , the thing worth all your fightings , When all 's done ye must fool Sir .
Well , I must then .
But do you know what fooling is ? true fooling , The circumstances that belong unto it ? For every idle knave that showes his teeth , Wants and would live , can juggle , tumble , fiddle , Make a dog face , or can abuse his fellow , Is not a fool at first dash ; you shall find SirStrange turnings in this trade ; to fool is nothingAs fooling has been , but to fool the fair way , The new way , as the best men fool their friends , For all men get by fooling , meerly fooling , Desert does nothing , valiant , wise , vertuous , Are things that walk by without bread or breeches .
I partly credit that .
Fine wits , fine wits Sir , There 's the young Boy , he does well in his way too , He could not live else in his Masters absence ; He tyes a Ladyes garters so , so prettily , Say his hand slip , but say so .
Why let it slip then .
'T is ten to one the body shall come after , And he that works deserves his wages .
That 's true .
He riddles finely to a waiting Gentlewoman , Expounds dreams like a Prophet , dreams himself too , And wishes all dreams true ; they cry Amen , And there 's a Memorandum : he can sing tooBawdy enough to please old Ladies : he lies rarely , Pawns ye a sute of clothes at all points , fully , Can pick a pocket if ye please , or casket ; Lisps when he lists to catch a Chambermaid , And calls his Hostess mother , these are things now , If a man mean to live : to fight and swagger , Beaten about the Ears with bawling sheepskins , Cut to the soul for Summer : here an arm lost , And there a leg ; his honourable headSeal 'd up in salves and cereclothes , like a packet , And so sent over to an Hospital , stand there , charge there , Swear there , whore there , dead there , And all this sport for cheese , and chines of dog-flesh , And mony when two wednesdayes meet together , Where to be lowzie is a Gentleman , And he that wears a clean shirt has his shrowd on .
I'le be your scholar , come if I like fooling .

Why was there not such women in the camp thenPrepar 'd to make me know 'em ?
'T was no place Sir .
Why should they live in Tumults ? they are creaturesSoft and of sober natures .
Cou 'd not your wives , Your Mothers , or your Sisters have been sent forTo exercise upon ?
We thank your Lordship .
But do you mean ?
I do mean .
What Sir ?
To see her , And see thee hang 'd too an thou anger'st me , And thousands of your throats cut , get ye from me , Ye keep a prating of your points of manners , And fill my head with lowzie circumstances , Better have Ballads i n't , your courtly worships , How to put off my hat , you , how to turn me , And you ( forsooth ) to blow my nose discreetly ; Let me alone , for I will love her , see her , Talk to her , and mine own way .
She 's the Princess .
Why let her be the Devil , I have spokeWhen Thunder durst not check me , I must love , I know she was a thing kept for me .
And I know Sir , Though she were born yours , yet your strange behaviourAnd want --
Thou liest .
I do not .
Ha !
I do not lye Sir , I say you want fair language , nay 't is certainYou can not say good morrow .
Ye Dog-whelps , The proudest of your prating tongues --
Doe , kill us , Kill us for telling truth : for my part , General , I would not live to see men make a may-gameOf him I have made a Master , kill us quickly , Then ye may --
What ?
Doe what you list , draw your sword childishlyUpon your Servants that are bound to tell ye ; I am weary of my life .
And I .
And all Sir .
Goe to the Princess , make her sport , cry to herI am the glorious man of war .

How came he hither ? see for Heavens sake wenches , What face , and what postures he puts on , { Mem. walks asideI do not think he is perfect. { full of strange { gestures .
If your loveHave not betray 'd his little wits , he 's well enough , As well as he will be .
Mark how he muses .
H'as a Batalia now in 's brains , he draws out , nowHave at ye Harpers .
See , see , there the fire fails .
Look what an Alphabet of faces he runs through .
O love , love , how amorously thou look'stIn an old rusty armour .
I 'll away , for by my troth I fear him .
Fear the gods , Madam , And never care what man can do , this fellowWith all his frights about him and his furies , His Larums , and his Launces , Swords , and Targets , Nay case him up in armour Cap-a-pe , Yet durst I undertake within two hours , If he durst charge , to give him such a shake , Should shake his Valour off , and make his shanks to ake .
For shame no more .
He muses still .
The Devil -- Why should this old dryed timber chopt with thunder --
Old Wood burns quickest .
Out , you would say Madam , Give me a green stick that may hold me heat , And smoak me soundly too ; He turns , and sees ye. { Memnon { comes to her .

My Fortune , 'T is very apt , Sir .
Women , let my FortuneAnd me alone I wish ye , pray come this way , And stand you still there Lady .
Leave the words Sir , and leap into the meaning .
Then again : I tell you I do love ye .
Why ?
No questions : pray no more questions.I do love you , infinitely : why do you smile ? Am I ridiculous ?
I am monstrous fearful , no , I joy you love me .
Joy on then , and be proud o n't , I do love you , Stand still , do not trouble me you Women.He loves you Lady at whose feet have kneel'dPrinces to beg their freedoms , he whose valourHas overrun whole Kingdoms .
That makes me doubt , Sir , 'Twill overrun me too .
He whose Sword .
Talk not so big , Sir , you will fright the Princess .
Ha .
No forsooth .
I know ye have done wonders .
I have and will do more and greater , braver ; And for your beauty miracles , name that KingdomAnd take your choice .
Sir I am not ambitious .
Ye shall be , 't is the Child of Glory : she that I loveWhom my desires shall magnifie , time stories , And all the Empires of the Earth .
I would fain ask him --
Prithee be quiet , he will beat us both else .
What will ye make me then , Sir ?
I will make theeStand still and hold thy peace ; I have a heart , Lady .
Ye were a monster else .
A loving heart , A truly loving heart .
Alas , how came it ?
I would you had it in your hand , sweet Lady , To see the truth it bears you .
Do you give it .
That was well thought upon .
'Twill put him to't Wench .
And you shall see I dare accept it , Sir , Tak't in my hand and view it : if I find itA loving and a sweet heart , as you call it , I am bound , I am .
No more , I 'll send it to ye , As I have honour in me , you shall have it .

Ye have greas 'd himFor chewing love again in haste .
If he should do it .
If Heaven should fall we should have larks ; he do it !
See how he thinks upo n't .
He will think these three yearsEre he prove such an Ass , I lik't his offer , There was no other way to put him off else .
I will do it -- Lady expect my heart .
I do , Sir .
Love it , for 't is a heart that -- and so I leave ye. [ Exit Mem .
Either he is stark mad , Or else I thinks he means it .
He must be stark madOr else he will never do it , 't is vain Glory , And want of judgment that provokes this in him ; Sleep and Society cures all : his heart ?

For to meet her thereBeing a Princess and a Kings sole SisterWith great accommodation must be cared for .
Weigh but the Souldiers poverty .

Next --
Shall I speak louder , Sir ?
A square Battalia --
You do not think of us .
Their Armours gilded --
Good noble Sir .
And round about such EnginesShall make Hell shake .
Ye do not mock me .
For , Sir , I will be strong , as brave --
Ye may consider , You know we have serv 'd you long enough .
No SouldierThat ever landed on the blest ElyziumDid or shall march , as I will .
Would ye would march , Sir , Up to the King and get us --
King nor KeiserShall equal me in that world .
What a Devil ails he ?
Next , the rare beauties of those Towns I fir 'd .
I speak of money , Sir .
Ten thousand Coaches --
O pounds , Sir , pounds I beseech your Lordship , Let Coaches run out of your remembrance .
In which the wanton Cupids , and the GracesDrawn with the Western winds kindling desires , And then our Poets --
Then our pay .
For Chilax when the triumph comes ; the PrincessThen , for I will have a Heaven made --
Bless your Lordship ! Stand still , Sir .
So I do , and in it --
Death Sir , You talk you know not what .
Such rare devices : Make me I say a Heaven .
I say so too , Sir .
For here shall run a Constellation .
And there a pissing Conduit .
Ha !
With wine , Sir .
A Sun there in his height , there such a Planet .
But where 's our money , where runs that ?
Ha ?
Money , Money a n't like your Lordship .
Why all the carriage shall come behind , the stuff , Rich hangings , treasure ; Or say we have none .
I may say so truly , For hang me if I have a Groat : I have serv 'd wellAnd like an honest man : I see no reason --
Thou must needs die good Chilax .
Very well , Sir .
I will have honest , valiant souls about me , I can not miss thee .
Dye ?
Yes die , and Pelius,
and Polybius : I shall thinkOf more within these two hours .
Dye Sir ?
I , Sir , And ye shall dye .
When , I beseech your Lordship ?
To morrow see ye do dye .
A short warning , Troth , Sir , I am ill prepar 'd .
I dye my self then , Beside there 's reason --
Oh !
I pray thee tell me , For thou art a great Dreamer .
I can dream , Sir , If I eat well and sleep well .
Was it neverBy Dream or Apparition open 'd to thee --
He 's mad .
What the other world was , or Elyzium ? Didst never travel in thy sleep ?
To Taverns , When I was drunk o 're night ; or to a Wench , There 's an Elyzium for ye , a young LadyWrapt round about ye like a Snake : is that it ? Or if that strange Elyzium that you talk ofBe where the Devil is , I have dream't of him , And that I have had him by the horns , and rid him , He trots the Dagger out o'th ' sheath .
Elyzium , The blessed fields man .
I know no fields blessed , but those I have gain 'd by.I have dream't I have been in Heaven too .
There , handle that place ; that 's Elyzium .
Brave singing , and brave dancing , And rare things .
All full of flowers .
And Pot-herbs .
Bowers for lovers , And everlasting ages of delight .
I slept not so far .
Meet me on those banksSome two days hence .
In Dream , Sir ?
No in death , Sir.And there I Muster all , and pay the Souldier.Away , no more , no more .
God keep your Lordship : This is fine dancing for us .

Where 's the General ?
There 's the old sign of Memnon , where the soul isYou may go look as I have .
What 's the matter ?
Why question him and see ; he talks of Devils , Hells , Heavens , Princes , Powers , and Potentates , You must to th ' pot too .
How ?
Do you know Elyzium ? a tale he talks the Wild-goose chase of .
Elyzium ? I have read of such a place .
Then get ye to him , Ye are as fine company as can be fitted. [ Exit Chilax.Your Worships fairly met .
Mercy upon us , What ails this Gentleman ?

How his head works !
Between two Ribbs , If he cut short or mangle me ; I'le take himAnd twirle his neck about .

In a pure Cup transparent , with a writingTo signifie --
I never knew him thus : Sure he 's bewitch 'd , or poyson 'd .
Who 's there ?
I Sir .
Come hither , Siphax .
Yes , how does your Lordship ?
Well , God a mercy Souldier , very well , But prithee tell me --
Any thing I can , Sir .
What durst thou do to gain the rarest BeautyThe World has ?
That the World has ? 't is worth doing .
Is it so ; but what doing bears it ?
Why ! any thing ; all danger it appears to .
Name some of those things : do .
I would undertake , Sir , A Voyage round about the World .
Short , Siphax.A Merchant does it to spice pots of Ale .
I wou 'd swim in Armour .
Short still ; a poor JadeLoaden will take a stream and stem it stronglyTo leap a Mare .
The plague , I durst .
Still shorter , I 'll cure it with an Onion .
Surfeits .
Short still : They are often Physicks for our healths , and help us .
I wou 'd stand a breach .
Thine honour bids thee , Souldier : 'T is shame to find a second cause .
I durst , Sir , Fight with the fellest Monster .
That 's the poorest , Man was ordain 'd their Master ; durst ye dye , Sir ?
How ? dye my Lord !
Dye Siphax ; take thy Sword , And come by that door to her ; there 's a priceTo buy a lusty love at .
I am content , Sir , To prove no Purchaser .
Away thou World-worm , Thou win a matchless Beauty ?
'T is to lose't Sir , For being dead , where 's the reward I reach at ? The love I labour for ?
There it begins Fool , Thou art meerly cozen 'd ; for the loves we now knowAre but the heats of half an hour ; and hatedDesires stir 'd up by nature to encrease her ; Licking of one another to a lust ; Course and base appetites , earths meer inheritoursAnd Heirs of Idleness and blood ; Pure Love , That , that the soul affects , and can not purchaseWhile she is loaden with our flesh , that Love , Sir , Which is the price of honour , dwells not here , Your Ladies eyes are lampless to that Vertue , That beauty smiles not on a cheek washt over , Nor scents the sweet of Ambers ; below , SiphaxBelow us , in the other World Elyzium , Where 's no more dying , no despairing , mourning , Where all desires are full , desarts down loaden , There Siphax , there , where loves are ever living .
Why do we love in this World then ?
To preserve it , The maker lost his work else ; but mark Siphax , What issues that love bears .
Why Children , Sir.I never heard him talk thus ; thus divinelyAnd sensible before .
It does so , Siphax , Things like our selves , as sensual , vain , unventedBubbles , and breaths of air , got with an itchingAs blisters are , and bred , as much corruptionFlows from their lives , sorrow conceives and shapes 'em , And oftentimes the death of those we love most.The breeders bring them to the World to curse 'em , Crying they creep amongst us like young Cats.Cares and continual Crosses keeping with 'em , They make Time old to tend them , and experienceAn ass , they alter so ; they grow and goodly , Ere we can turn our thoughts , like drops of waterThey fall into the main , are known no more ; This is the love of this World ; I must tell theeFor thou art understanding .
What you please , Sir .
And as a faithful man : Nay I dare trust thee , I love the Princess .
There 't is , that has fired him , I knew he had some inspiration.But does she know it , Sir ?
Yes marry does she , I have given my heart unto her .
If ye love her .
Nay , understand me , my heart taken from me , Out of my Body , man , and so brought to her.How lik'st thou that brave offer ? there 's the loveI told thee of ; and after death , the living ; She must in justice come Boy , ha ?
Your heart , Sir ?
I , so by all means , Siphax .
He loves roast wellThat eats the Spit .
And since thou art come thus fitly , I 'll do it presently and thou shalt carry it , For thou canst tell a story and describe it.And I conjure thee , Siphax , by thy gentry , Next by the glorious Battels we have fought in , By all the dangers , wounds , heats , colds , distresses , Thy love next , and obedience , nay thy life .
But one thing , first , Sir , if she pleas 'd to grant it , Could ye not love her here and live ? consider .
Ha ? Yes , I think I could .
'Twould be far nearer , Besides the sweets here would induce the last loveAnd link it in .
Thou sayest right , but our ranks hereAnd bloods are bars between us , she must stand off tooAs I perceive she does .
Desert and DutyMakes even all , Sir .
Then the King , though IHave merited as much as man can , must not let her , So many Princes covetous of her beauty ; I wou 'd with all my heart , but 't is impossible .
Why , say she marry after .
No , she dares not ; The gods dare not do ill ; come .
Do you mean it ?
Lend me thy knife , and help me off .
For heaven sake , Be not so stupid mad , dear General .
Dispatch , I say .
As ye love that ye look for , Heaven and the blessed life .
Hell take thee , Coxcomb , Why dost thou keep me from it ? thy knife I say .
Do but this one thing , on my knees I beg it , Stay but two hours till I return again.For I will to her , tell her all your merits , Your most unvalu 'd love , and last your danger ; If she relent , then live still , and live loving , Happy , and high in favour : if she frown --
Shall I be sure to know it ?
As I live , Sir , My quick return shall either bring ye fortune , Or leave you to your own fate .
Two hours ?
Yes , Sir .
Let it be kept , away , I will expect it. [ Ex. Mem. Si .

Your patience , 'T is a hard day at Court , a fish day .
So it seems , Sir , The fins grow out of thy face .
And to purchaseThis day the company of one dear Custard , Or a mess of Rice ap Thomas , needs a main wit ; Beef we can bear before us lined with BrewesAnd tubs of Pork ; vociferating Veals , And Tongues that ne 're told lye yet .
Line thy mouth with 'em .
Thou hast need , and great need , For these finny fish-dayes , The Officers understandings are so flegmatick , They can not apprehend us .

Why hang him quickly , And then he can not hurt folks .
One hour raving , Another smiling , not a word the third hour , I tell thee Stremon h'as a stirring soul , What ever it attempts or labours atWould wear out twenty bodies in another .
I'le keep it out of me , for mine 's but Buckram , He would bownce that out in two hours .

Sirrah , hold him , I 'll have but one blow at his head .
I 'll do it , Why what should we do living after you , Sir ? We 'll dye before if ye please .
No , no .
Living ? hang living.Is there ne'r a Cat hole where I may creep through ? Would I were in the Indies. [ Aside .
Swear then , and after my death presentlyTo kill your selves and follow , as ye are honest , As ye have faiths , and loves to me .
We 'll do it .
Pray do not stir yet , we are near enoughTo run between all dangers .
Here I am , Sir ; Come , look upon me , view the best way boldly , Fear nothing , but cut home ; if your hand shake , Sirrah , Or any way deface my heart i'th ' cutting , Make the least scratch upon it ; but draw it whole , Excellent fair , shewing at all points , Surgeon , The Honour and the Valour of the Owner , Mixt with the most immaculate love I send it , Look to't , I 'll slice thee to the Soul .
Ne'r fear , Sir , I 'll do it daintily ; would I were out once .
I will not have ye smile , Sirrah , when ye do it , As though ye cut a Ladies Corn ; 't is scurvy : Do me it as thou dost thy Prayers , seriously .
I 'll do it in a dump , Sir .
In a Dog , Sir , I 'll have no dumps , nor dumplins ; fetch your tools , And then I 'll tell ye more .
If I returnTo hear more , I 'll be hang 'd for't .
Quick , quick .
Yes Sir , With all the heels we have. [ Exeunt Surgeon , Demagoras .

My dear Polydore , Welcome from travel , welcome ; and how do ye ?
Well Sir , would you were so .
I am , I thank ye.You are a better 'd man much , I the same still , An old rude Souldier , Sir .
Pray be plain , Brother , And tell me but the meaning of this Vision , For to me it appears no more ; so farFrom common Course and Reason .
Thank thee , Fortune , At length I have found the man : the man must do it , The man in honour bound .
To do what ?
Hark , for I will bless ye with the circumstanceOf that weak shadow that appear 'd .
Speak on , Sir. [ Walks with him .
It is no Story for all ears .
The Princess ? [ Whispers .

Sure 't is dangerousHe starts so at it .
Your heart ? do you know , Sir ?
Yes , Pray thee be softer .
Me to do it ?
Only reserv 'd , and dedicated .
For shame , Brother , Know what ye are , a man .
None of your Athens , Good sweet Sir , no Philosophy , thou feel'st notThe honourable end , fool .
I am sure I feelThe shame and scorn that follows ; have ye serv 'd thus longThe glory of your Country , in your Conquests ? The envy of your Neighbours , in your Vertues ? Rul 'd Armies of your own , given Laws to Nations , Belov 'd and fear 'd as far as Fame has travell 'd , Call 'd the most fortunate and happy Memnon , To lose all here at home , poorly to lose it ? Poorly , and pettishly , ridiculouslyTo fling away your fortune ? where 's your Wisedom ? Where 's that you govern 'd others by , discretion ? Do 's your Rule lastly hold upon your self ? fie Brother , How ye are faln ? Get up into your honour , The top branch of your bravery , and from thence , Look and behold how little Memnon seems now .
Hum ! 't is well spoken ; but dost thou think young Scholar , The tongues of Angels from my happinessCould turn the end I aim at ? no , they can not .This is no Book-case , Brother ; will ye do it ? Use no more art , I am resolv 'd .
Ye may SirCommand me to do any thing that 's honest , And for your noble end : but this , it carries --
Ye shall not be so honour 'd ; live an Ass still , And learn to spell for profit : go , go study .
Ye must not hold him up so , he is lost then .
Get thee to School again , and talk of turnips , And find the natural Cause out , why a DogTurns thrice about e 're he lyes down : there 's Learning .
Come , I will do it now ; 't is brave , I find it , And now allow the reason .
O do you so , Sir ? Do ye find it currant ?
Yes , yes , excellent .

Then is't not excellent , do ye conceive it ?
'Twill work for certain .
O 'twill tickle her , And you shall know then by a line .

Yes , and the strangest , Gentlemen , That e'r I heard of , anon I 'll tell ye : StremonBe you still near him to affect his fancy , And keep his thoughts off : let the Fool and BoyStay him , they may do some pleasure too : EumenesWhat if he had a Wench , a handsome Whore brought , Rarely drest up , and taught to state it ?

Polydor , and Captains , Eumenes mourning .
It seems some Souldiers funeral : see it enters .

The Gods keep ye fair Calis .
This man can speak , and well ; he stands and views us ; Wou 'd I were ne'r worse look't upon : how humblyHis eyes are cast now to the Earth ! pray mark himAnd mark how rarely he has rankt his troubles : See now he weeps , they all weep ; a sweeter sorrowI never look't upon , nor one that braverBecame his grief ; your will with us ?
Great Lady , [ Plucks out the Cup.Excellent beauty .
He speaks handsomely.What a rare rhetorician his grief plaies ! That stop was admirable .
See , see thou Princess , Thou great commander of all hearts .
I have found it , O how my soul shakes !
See , see the noble heartOf him that was the noblest : see and glory ( Like the proud God himself ) in what thou hast purchas 'd , Behold the heart of Memnon : does it start ye ?
Good gods , what has his wildness done ?
Look boldlie , You boldlie said you durst , look wretched woman , Nay flie not back fair follie , 't is too late now , Vertue and blooming honour bleed to death here , Take it , the Legacie of Love bequeath 'd ye , Of cruel Love a cruel Legacie ; What was the will that wrought it then ? can ye weep ? Imbalm it in your truest tearsIf women can weep a truth , or ever sorrow sunk yetInto the soul of your sex , for 't is a JewelThe worlds worth can not weigh down , Take it Lady ; And with it all ( I dare not curse ) my sorrows , And may they turn to Serpents .
How she looksStill upon him ! see now a tear steals from her .
But still she keeps her eye firm .
Next read this , But since I see your spirit somewhat troubledI'le doe it for ye .
Still she eyes him mainlie .
Now it pours down .
I like it rarelie : Ladie .
How greedily she swallows up his language !
Her eye inhabits on him .
Cruel Ladie , Great as your beautie scornfull ; had your powerBut equal poise on all hearts , all hearts perish't ; But Cupid has more shafts than one , more flames too , And now he must be open ey 'd , 't is Justice : Live to injoy your longing ; live and laugh atThe losses and the miseries we suffer ; Live to be spoken when your crueltieHas cut off all the vertue from this Kingdom , Turn 'd honour into earth , and faithful service .
I swear his anger 's excellent .
Truth , and most tried loveInto disdain and downfall .
Still more pleasing .
Live then I say famous for civil slaughters , Live and lay out your triumphs , gild your glories , Live and be spoken this is she , this Ladie , This goodly Ladie , yet most killing beautie ; This with the two edg 'd eyes , the heart for hardnessOutdoing rocks ; and coldness , rocks of Crystal.This with the swelling soul , more coy of CourtshipThan the proud sea is when the shores embrace him ; Live till the mothers find ye , read your story , And sow their barren curses on your beauty , Till those that have enjoy 'd their loves despise ye , Till Virgins pray against ye , old age find ye , And even as wasted coals glow in their dying , So may the Gods reward ye in your ashes : But y'are the Sister of my King ; more propheciesElse I should utter of ye , true loves and loyalBless themselves ever from ye : so I leave ye .

Why Gentleman , is she not worthy marriage ?
Most worthy , Sir , where worth again shall meet her , But I like thick clouds sailing slow and heavy , Although by her drawn higher , yet shall hide her , I dare not be a traitor ; and 't is treason , But to imagine : as you love your honour --
'T is her first maiden doting , and if crost , I know it kills her .
How knows your grace she loves him ?
Her woman told me all ( beside his story ) Her maid Lucippe , on what reason too , And 't is beyond all but enjoying .

You shall not kneel , Sir , Come , I have done you wrong ; stand my Souldier , And thus I make amends -- [ Kisses him .
A Plague confound ye , Is this your state ?
'T is well enough .
O Lady , Your Royal hand , your hand my dearest beautyIs more than I must purchase : here divine one , I dare revenge my wrongs : ha ?
A damn 'd foul one .
The Lees of Baudy prewns : mourning Gloves ? All spoil 'd by Heaven .
Ha ! who art thou ?
A shame on ye , Ye clawing scabby Whore .
I say , who art thou ?
Why 't is the Princess , Sir .
The Devil , Sir , 'T is some Roguey thing .
If this abuse be love , Sir , Or I that laid aside my modesty --
So far thou't never find it .
Do not weep , For if ye be the Princess , I will love ye , Indeed I will , and honour ye , fight for ye , Come , wipe your eyes ; by Heaven she stinks ; who art thou ? Stinks like a poyson 'd Rat behind a hanging ? Woman , who art ? like a rotten Cabbage .
Y'are much to blame , Sir , 't is the Princess .
How ? She the Princess ?
And the loving Princess .
Indeed the doating Princess .
Come hither once more , The Princess smells like mornings breath , pure Amber , Beyond the courted Indies in her spices.Still a dead Rat by Heaven ; thou a Princess ?
What a dull Whore is this !
I'le tell ye presently , For if she be a Princess , as she may beAnd yet stink too , and strongly , I shall find her ; Fetch the Numidian Lyon I brought over , If she be sprung from the Royal blood , the Lyon , He'l do you reverence , else --
I beseech your Lordship --
He'l tear her all to pieces .
I am no Princess , Sir .
Who brought thee hither ?
If ye confess , we 'll hang ye .
Good my Lord --
Who art thou then ?
A poor retaining Whore , Sir , To one of your Lordships Captains .
Alas poor Whore , Go , be a Whore still , and stink worse : Ha , ha , ha. [ Ex. Cloe.What fools are these , and Coxcombs ! [ Exit Memnon .
I am right glad yet , He takes it with such lightness .
Me thinks his face tooIs not so clouded as it was ; how he looks !
Where 's your dead Rat ?
The Devil dine upon herLoins ; why what a Medicine had he gottenTo try a Whore !
Stremon .
Here 's one from Polydor stays to speak with ye .
With whom ?
With all ; where has the General been ? He 's laughing to himself extreamly .
Come , I'le tell thee how ; I am glad yet he 's so merry. [ Exeunt .
Chilax and Priestess , Calis , Lady and Nun .
What lights are those that enter there , still nearer ? Plague o ' your rotten itch , do you draw me hitherInto the Temple to betray me ? was there no placeTo satisfie your sin in ? Gods forgive me , Still they come forward .
Peace ye fool , I have found it , 'T is the young Princess Calis .
'T is the Devil , To claw us for our catterwawling .
Retire softly , I did not look for you these two hours , Lady , Beshrew your hast : that way. [ To Chilax .
That goes to the Altar ! Ye old blind Beast .
I know not , any way ; Still they come nearer , I'le in to th ' Oracle .
That 's well remembred I'le in with ye .
Do. [ Exeunt Priest , and Chilax .
Calis and her Train with lights , singing : Lucippe , Cleanthe.SONG .
Enter a Nun.Nun. You about her all retire,
[ Exit Nun and draws the Curtain close to Calis .
Stremon and Eumenes .
He will abroad .
How does his humour hold him ?
He is now grown wondrous sad , weeps often too , Talks of his Brother to himself , starts strangely .
Does he not curse ?
No .
Nor break out in fury , Offering some new attempt ?
Neither ; to th ' TempleIs all we hear of now : what there he will do --
I hope repent his folly , let 's be near him .
Where are the rest ?
About a businessConcerns him mainly , if Heav'n cure his madness , He 's made for ever , Stremon .
Does the King know it ?
Yes , and much troubled with it , he 's now goneTo seek his Sister out .
Come let 's away then. [ Exeunt Eumen. Strem. Cal .
Calis.Calis at the Oracle .
Peace to your Prayers Lady , will it please yeTo pass on to the Oracle ?
Most humbly. [ Chilax and Priest , in the Oracle .
Do ye hear that ?
Yes , lie close .
A wildfire take ye , What shall become of me ? I shall be hang 'd now : Is this a time to shake ? a halter shake ye , Come up and juggle , come .
I am monstrous fearful .
Up ye old gaping Oyster , up and answer ; A mouldy Mange upon your chops , ye told meI was safe here till the Bell rung .
I was prevented , And did not look these three hours for the Princess .
Shall we be taken ?
Speak for loves sake , Chilax ; I can not , nor I dare not .
I'le speak Treason , for I had as lieve be hang 'd for that .
Good Chilax .
Must it be sung or said ? what shall I tell 'em ? They are here ; here now preparing .
O my Conscience !
Plague o ' your spurgall 'd Conscience , does it tire now ? Now when it should be tuffest ? I could make thee --
Save us , we are both undone else .
Down ye Dog then , Be quiet , and be stanch to no inundations .
Here kneel again , and Venus grant your wishes.Calis. O Divine Star of Heaven,
When ?
Now speak handsomly , and small by all means , I have told ye what. [ Thunder .
But I'le tell you a new tale , Now for my Neck-verse ; I have heard thy prayers , And mark me well .
Venus descends .
The Goddess is displeased much , The temple shakes and totters ; she appears , Bow , Lady , bow.Venus. Purge me the Temple round,
O gentle goddess !
Rise , thy doom is said , And fear not , I will please thee with the dead. [ Venus ascends .
Go up into the Temple and there endYour holy Rites , the Goddess smiles upon ye. [ Exeunt Cal. and Nun .
Chilax in his Robe .
I 'll no more Oracles , nor Miracles , Nor no more Church work , I 'll be drawn and hang 'd first.Am not I torn a pieces with the thunder ? Death , I can scarce believe I live yet , It gave me on the buttocks , a cruel , a huge bang , I had as lieve ha ' had 'em scratcht with Dog-whips : Be quiet henceforth , now ye feel the end o n't , I would advise ye my old friends , the good GentlewomanIs strucken dumb , and there her Grace sits mumpingLike an old Ape eating a Brawn ; sure the good GoddessKnew my intent was honest , to save the Princess , And how we young men are entic 'd to wickedness , By these lewd Women , I had paid for't else too.I am monstrous holy now , and cruel fearful , O 't was a plaguey thump , charg 'd with a vengeance .
Siphax , walks softly over the stage , and goes in.Would I were well at home ; the best is , 't is not day : Who 's that ? ha ? Siphax ! I 'll be with you anon , Sir ; Ye shall be oracled I warrant ye , And thunder 'd too , as well as I ; your Lordship
Memnon , Eumenes , Stremon , and two carrying Torches.Must needs enjoy the Princess , yes : ha ! Torches ? And Memnon coming this way ? he 's Dog-mad , And ten to one appearing thus unto him , He worries me , I must go by him .
Sir ?
Ask me no further questions ; what art thou ? How dost thou stare ! stand off ; nay look upon me , I do not shake , nor fear thee -- [ Draws his Sword .
He will kill me , This is for Church work .
Why dost thou appear now ? Thou wert fairly slain : I know thee , Diocles , And know thine envy to mine honour : but --
Stay Memnon , I am a Spirit , and thou canst not hurt me .
This is the voice of Chilax .
What makes him thus ?
'T is true , that I was slain in field , but foully , By multitudes , not manhood : therefore mark me , I do appear again to quit mine honour , And on thee single .
I accept the challenge.Where ?
On the Stygian Banks .
When ?
Four days hence .
Go noble Ghost , I will attend .
I thank ye .
Ye have sav 'd your throat , and handsomly : Farewel , Sir. [ Exit Chilax .
Sing me the Battles of Pelusium , In which this Worthy dyed .
This will spoil all , and make him worseThan e'r he was : sit down , Sir , And give your self to rest.SONG .
-- dub , dub .
-- Tara , tara , tara .
-- tara , tara .
Memnon arm 'd with thunder,
Eumenes has the Chace,
Polybius makes good his place .
Hey , hey.Hark how the Souldiers hollow
Diocles is dead,
Now forward to the Temple. [ Exeunt .
Chilax .
Are ye gone ? How have I 'scap 'd this morning ! by what miracle ! Sure I am ordain 'd for some brave end .
Cloe .
How is it ?
Come , 't is as well as can be .
But is it possibleThis should be true you tell me ?
'T is most certain .
Such a gross Ass to love the Princess ?
Peace , Pull your Robe close about ye : you are perfectIn all I taught ye ?
Sure .
Gods give thee good luck.'Tis strange my Brains should still be beating KnaveryFor all these dangers , but they are needful mischiefs , And such are Nuts to me ; and I must do 'em.You will remember me --
By this kiss , Chilax .
No more of that , I fear another thunder .
We are not i'th ' Temple , man .
Siphax .
Peace , here he comes , Now to our business handsomly ; away now. [ Ex. Chilax , and Cloe .
'T was sure the Princess , for he kneel 'd unto her , And she lookt every way : I hope the OracleHas made me happy ; me I hope she lookt for,
Chilax , and Cloe at the other door.Fortune , I will so honour thee , Love , so adore thee.She is here again , looks round about her , again too , 'T is done , I know 't is done ; 't is Chilax with her , And I shall know of him ; who 's that ?
Speak softly , The Princess from the Oracle .
She views me , By Heaven she beckons me .
Come near , she wou 'd have ye .
O royal Lady. [ Kisses her hand .
She wills ye read that , for belike she 's bound to silenceFor such a time ; she is wondrous gracious to ye .
Heav'n make me thankful .
She would have ye read it. [ He reads .
Siphax , the will of Heaven hath cast me on theeTo be thy Wife , whose Will must be obey 'd : Use me with honour , I shall love thee dearly , And make thee understand thy worths hereafter ; Convey me to a secret Ceremony , That both our hearts and loves may be united , And use no Language , till before my BrotherWe both appear , where I will shew the Oracle , For till that time I am bound , I must not answer .
O happy I !
Ye are a made man .
But Chilax , Where are her Women ?
None but your Graces Sister , Because she would have it private to the World yet , Knows of this business .
I shall thank thee , Chilax , Thou art a careful man .
Your Graces Servant .
I 'll find a fit place for thee .
If you will not , There 's a good Lady will , she points ye forward , Away and take your fortune ; not a word , Sir : So , you are greas 'd I hope. [ Ex. Si. and Cloe , manet Chilax .
Stremon , Fool , and Boy .
Stremon , Fool , Picus , Where have you left your Lord ?
I ' th ' Temple , Chilax .
Why are ye from him ?
Why , the King is with him , And all the Lords .
Is not the Princess there too ?
Yes.And the strangest Coil amongst 'em ; She weeps bitterly : The King entreats , and frowns , my Lord like AutumnDrops off his hopes by handfulls , all the TempleSweats with this Agony .
Where 's young Polydore ?
Dead , as they said , o ' th ' sudden .
Dead ?
For certain , But not yet known abroad .
There 's a new trouble , A brave young man he was ; but we must all dye .
Did not the General meet you this morningLike a tall Stallion Nun ?
No more o ' that , Boy .
You had been ferretting .
That 's all one , Fool ; My Master Fool that taught my wits to traffick , What has your Wisedom done ? how have you profited ? Out with your Audit : come , you are not empty , Put out mine eye with twelve-pence ? do you shaker ? What think you of this shaking ? here 's wit , Coxcomb , Ha Boys ? ha my fine Rascals , here 's a Ring , { Pulls outHow right they go ! { a Purse .
O let me ring the fore Bell. [ Chi. ] And here are thumpers , Chiqueens , golden rogues , Wit , wit , ye Rascals .
I have a Stye here , Chilax .
I have no Gold to cure it , not a penny , Not one cross , Cavalier ; we are dull Souldiers , Gross heavy-headed fellows ; fight for Victuals ?
Why , ye are the Spirits of the time .
By no means .
The valiant firie .
Fie , fie , no .
Be-lee me , Sir .
I wou 'd I cou 'd , Sir .
I will satisfie ye .
But I will not content you ; alas poor Boy , Thou shew'st an honest Nature , weepst for thy Master , There 's a red Rogue to buy thee Handkerchiefs .
He was an honest Gentleman , I have lost too .
You have indeed your labour , Fool ; but Stremon , Dost thou want money too ? no Vertue living ? No firking out at fingers ends ?
It seems so .
Will ye all serve me ?
Yes , when ye are Lord General , For less I will not go .
There 's Gold for thee then , Thou hast a Souldiers mind. Fool --
Here , your first man .
I will give thee for thy Wit , for 't is a fine wit , A dainty diving Wit , hold up , just nothing , Go graze i ' th ' Commons , yet I am merciful -- There 's six-pence : buy a Saucer , steal an old Gown , And beg i ' th ' Temple for a Prophet , come away Boys , Let 's see how things are carried , Fool , up Sirrah , You may chance get a dinner : Boy , your prefermentI 'll undertake , for your brave Masters sake , You shall not perish .
Chilax .
Please me well , Fool.And you shall light my pipes : away to the Temple.But stay , the King 's here , sport upon sport , Boys .
, Siphax kneeling , Cloe with a Vail .
What would you have , Captain ? Speak suddenly , for I am wondrous busie .
A pardon , Royal Sir .
For what ?
For thatWhich was Heaven 's Will , should not be mine alone , Sir ; My marrying with this Lady .
It needs no pardon , For Marriage is no Sin .
Not in it self , Sir ; But in presuming too much : yet Heaven knows , So does the Oracle that cast it on me , And -- -- the Princess , royal Sir .
What Princess ?
O be not angry my dread King , your Sister .
My Sister ; she 's i ' th ' Temple , Man .
She is here , Sir .
The Captain 's mad , she 's kneeling at the Altar .
I know she is ; with all my heart good Captain , I do forgive ye both : be unvail 'd , Lady. [ Puts off her Vail.Will ye have more forgiveness ? the man 's frantick , Come let 's go bring her out : God give ye joy , Sir .
How , Cloe ? my old Cloe ? [ Ex. King , Lords .
Even the same , Sir .
Gods give your manhood much content .
The PrincessLooks something musty since her coming over .
'Twere good you 'd brush her over .
Fools and FidlersMake sport at my abuse too ?
O 't is the NatureOf us Fools to make bold with one another , But you are wise , brave sirs .
Cheer up your Princess , Believe it Sir , the King will not be angry , Or say he were ; why , 't was the Oracle.The Oracle , a n't like your Grace , the Oracle .
And who , most mighty Siphax ?
With mine own whore .
With whom else should ye marry , speak your conscience , Will ye transgress the law of Arms , that everRewards the Souldier with his own sins ?
Devils .
Ye had my maiden-head , my youth , my sweetness , Is it not justice then ? --
I see it must be , But by this hand , I'le hang a lock upon thee .
You shall not need , my honesty shall doe it .
If there be wars in all the world --
I'le with ye , For you know I have been a Souldier , Come , curse on : when I need another Oracle .
Send for me Siphax , I'le fit ye with a Princess , And so to both your honours .
And your graces .
The Devil grace ye all .
God a mercy Chilax .
Shall we laugh half an hour now ?
No the King comes , And all the train .
Away then , our Act 's ended. [ Exeunt .
, Calis , Memnon , and Cleanthe , Lords .
You know he do 's deserve ye , loves ye dearly , You know what bloody violence had us 'd { The HearseUpon himself , but that his Brother crost it , { ready , Polydor , You know the same thoughts still inhabit in him { Eumenes & And covet to take birth : Look on him Lady , { Captains.The wars have not so far consum 'd him yet , Cold age disabled him , or sickness sunk himTo be abhorr 'd : look on his Honour Sister , That bears no stamp of time , no wrinkles on it , No sad demolishment , nor death can reach it : Look with the eyes of Heaven that nightly waken , To view the wonders of the glorious Maker , And not the weakness : look with your vertuous eyes , And then clad royaltie in all his conquests , His matchless love hung with a thousand merits , Eternal youth attending , Fame and Fortune , Time and Oblivion vexing at his vertues , He shall appear a miracle : look on our dangers , Look on the publick ruin .
O , dear Brother .
Fie , let us not like proud and greedy watersGain to give off again : this is our Sea , And you his Cynthia , govern him , take heed , His flouds have been as high , and full as any , And gloriously now is got up to the girdle , The Kingdomes he hath purchas 'd ; noble Sister , Take not your vertue from him , O take heedWe ebbe not now to nothing , take heed Calis .
The will of Heaven not mine , which must not alter , And my eternal doom for ought I knowIs fixt upon me ; alas , I must love nothing , Nothing that loves again must I be blest with : The gentle Vine climbs up the Oke and clips him , And when the stroke comes , yet they fall together ; Death , death must I enjoy , and live to love him , O noble Sir !
Those tears are some reward yet , Pray let me wed your sorrows .
Take 'em Souldier , They are fruitfull ones , lay but a sigh upon 'em , And straight they will conceive to infinites ; I told ye what ye would find 'em .
Funeral , Captains following , and Eumenes .
How now , what 's this ? more drops to th ' Ocean ? Whose body 's this ?
The noble Polydor , This speaks his death .
My Brother dead ?
O Goddess ! O cruel , cruel Venus , here 's my fortune .
Read Captain .
Read aloud : farewel my follies. [ Eumen. reads to the Excellent Princess Calis .
Be wise , as you are beauteous , love with judgement , And look with clear eyes on my noble Brother , Value desert and vertue , they are Jewels , Fit for your worth and wearing : take heed Lady , The Gods reward ingratitude most grievous ; Remember me no more , or if you must , Seek me in noble Memnons love , I dwell there : I durst not live , because I durst not wrong him , I can no more , make me eternal happyWith looking down upon your loves. Farewel .
And did'st thou die for me ?
Excellent vertue ! What will ye now doe ?
Dwell for ever here Sir .
For me dear Polydor ? O worthy young man ! O love , love , love , love above recompence ! Infinite love , infinite honesty ! Good Lady leave , you must have no share here , Take home your sorrows : here 's enough to store me , Brave glorious griefs ! was ever such a Brother ? Turn all the stories over in the world yet , And search through all the memories of mankind , And find me such a friend ; h'as out done all , Outstript 'em sheerly , all , all , thou hast Polydor , To die for me ; why , as I hope for happiness , 'T was one of the rarest thought on things , The bravest , and carried beyond compass of our actions , I wonder how he hit it , a young man too , In all the blossomes of his youth and beautie , In all the fulness of his veins and wishesWoo 'd by that Paradise , that would catch Heaven ; It starts me extreamly , thou blest Ashes , Thou faithfull monument , where love and friendshipShall while the world is , work new miracles .
O ! let me speak too .
No not yet ; thou man , ( For we are but mans shadows , ) only man , I have not words to utter him ; speak Lady , I'le think a while .
The Goddess grants me this yet , I shall enjoy the dead : no tomb shall hold theeBut these two arms , no Trickments but my tearsOver thy Hearse , my sorrows like sad armsShall hang for ever : on the tuffest MarbleMine eyes shall weep thee out an Epitaph , Love at thy feet shall kneel , his smart bow broken ; Faith at thy head , youth and the Graces mourners ; O sweet young man !
Now I begin to melt too .
Have ye enough yet Lady ? room for a gamester.To my fond Love , and all those idle fanciesA long farewel , thou diedst for me dear Polydor , To give me peace , thou hast eternal glory , I stay and talk here ; I will kiss thee first , And now I'le follow thee. [ Polydor rises .
Hold , for Heavens sake !
Ha ! Does he live ? Dost thou deceive me ?
Thus far , Yet for your good , and honour .
Now dear Sister .
The Oracle is ended , noble Sir , Dispose me now as you please .
You are mine then ?
With all the joyes that may be .
Your consent Sir ?
Ye have it freely .
Walk along with me then , And as you love me , love my will .
I will so .
Here worthy Brother , take this vertuous Princess , Ye have deserv 'd her nobly , she will love ye , And when my life shall bring ye peace , as she does , Command it , ye shall have it .
Sir , I thank ye .
I never found such goodness in such years .
Thou shalt not over-doe me , though I die for't , O how I love thy goodness , my best Brother , You have given me here a treasure to enrich me , Would make the worthiest King alive a begger , What may I give you back again ?
Your love Sir .
And you shall have it , even my dearest love , My first , my noblest love , take her again , Sir , She is yours , your honesty has over-run me , She loves ye , lose her not : excellent Princess , Injoy thy wish , and now get Generals .
As ye love heaven , love him , she is only yours , Sir .
As ye love heaven , love him , she is only yours , Sir ; My Lord , the King .
He will undoe himself Sir , And must without her perish ; who shall fight then ? Who shall protect your Kingdom ?
Give me hearing , And after that , belief , were she my soul ( As I do love her equal ) all my victories , And all the living names I have gain 'd by war , And loving him that good , that vertuous good man , That only worthy of the name of Brother , I would resign all freely , 't is all loveTo me , all marriage rites , the joy or issuesTo know him fruitfull , that has been so faithfull .
This is the noblest difference ; take your choice Sister .
I see they are so brave , and noble both , I know not which to look on .
Chuse discreetly , And vertue guide ye , there all the world in one manStands at the mark .
There all mans honestie , The sweetness of all youth --
O God 's !
My Armour , By all the God 's she 's yours ; my Arms , I say , And I beseech your Grace , give me imployment , That shall be now my Mistress , there my Courtship .
Ye shall have any thing .
Vertuous Lady , Remember me , your Servant now ; Young man , You can not over-reach me in your goodness ; O love ! how sweet thou look'st now ! and how gentle ! I should have slubber 'd thee , and stain 'd thy beauty ; Your hand , your hand Sir !
Take her , and Heaven bless her .
So .
'T is your will Sir , nothing of my merit ; And as your royal gift , I take this blessing .
And I from heaven this gentleman : thanks Goddess .
So ye are pleas 'd now Lady ?
Now or never .
My cold stiffe carkass would have frozen ye , Wars , wars .
Ye shall have wars .
My next brave battelI dedicate to your bright honour , Sister , Give me a favour , that the world may knowI am your Souldier .
This , and all fair Fortunes .
And he that bears this from me , must strike boldly. [ Cleanthe kneeling .
I do forgive thee : be honest ; no more wench .
Come now to Revels , this blest day shall proveThe happy crown of noble Faith and Love. [ Exeunt.Prologue .

Yet not to go too farIn promises from this our Female War.We do intreat the angry men would notExpect the mazes of a subtle plot , Set Speeches , high Expressions , and what 's worse , In a true Comedy , politick discourse.The end we aim at , is to make you sport ; Yet neither gall the City , nor the Court.Hear , and observe his Comique strain , and whenY ' are sick-of melancholy , see't agen.'Tis no dear Physick since 'twill quit the cost : Or his intentions with our pains , are lost .
Moroso , Sophocles , and Tranio , with Rosemary , as froma wedding .
God give 'em joy .
Amen .
Amen , say I too : The pudding 's now i'th ' proof , alas poor wench.Through what a mine of patience must thou work , E'r thou know'st good hour more !
'T is too true : Certain , Methinks her father has dealt harshly with her , Exceeding harshly , and not like a Father , To match her to this Dragon ; I protestI pity the poor Gentlewoman .
Methinks now , He 's not so terrible as people think him .
This old thief flatters , out of meer devotion , To please the Father for his second daughter .
But shall he have her ?
Yes , when I have Rome.And yet the father 's for him .
I 'll assure ye , I hold him a good man .
Yes sure a wealthy , But whether a good womans man , is doubtful .
Would 'twere no worse .
What though his other wife , Out of her most abundant soberness , Out of her daily hue and cries upon him , ( For sure she was a rebel ) turn 'd his temper , And forc 'd him blow as high as she ? dos't followHe must retain that long since buried Tempest , To this soft Maid ?
I fear it .
So do I too : And so far , that if God had made me woman , And his wife that must be --
What would you do , Sir ?
I would learn to eat coals with an angry Cat , And spit fire at him : I would ( to prevent him ) Do all the ramping , roaring tricks , a whoreBeing drunk , and tumbling ripe , would tremble at : There is no safety else , nor moral wisdom.To be a wife , and his .
So I should think too .
For yet the bare remembrance of his first wife ( I tell ye on my knowledge , and a truth too ) Will make him start in 's sleep , and very oftenCry out for Cudgels , Colestaves , any thing ; Hiding his breeches , out of fear her GhostShould walk , and wear 'em yet. Since his first marriage , He is no more the still Petruchio , Than I am Babylon .
He 's a good fellow , And on my word I love him : but to thinkA fit match for this tender soul --
His very frown , if she but say her prayersLouder than men talk treason , makes him tinder ; The motion of a Dial , when he 's testy , Is the same trouble to him as a Water-work ; She must do nothing of her self ; not eat , Drink , say Sir , how do ye ? make her ready , unready , Unless he bid her .
He will bury her , Ten pound to twenty shillings , within these three weeks .
I 'll be your half .
Jaques with a pot of Wine .
He loves her most extreamly , And so long 'twill be Honey-moon. Now Jaques.You are a busie man I am sure .
Yes certain , This old sport must have eggs .
Not yet this ten daies .
Sweet Gentlemen with Muskadel .
That 's right , Sir .
This fellow broods his Master : speed ye Jaques .
We shall be for you presently .
Your worshipsShall have it rich and neat : and o ' my conscienceAs welcome as our Lady-day : Oh my old Sir , When shall we see your worship run at Ring ? That hour , a standing were worth money .
So Sir .
Upon my little honesty , your Mistriss , If I have any speculation , must thinkThis single thrumming of a Fiddle , Without a Bow , but even poor sport .
Y'are merry .
Would I were wise too : so God bless your worship .
The fellow tells you true. [ Exit Jaq .
When is the day man ? Come , come , you 'll steal a marriage .
Nay , believe me : But when her Father pleases , I am ready , And all my friends shall know it .
Why not now ? One charge had serv 'd for both .
There 's reason i n't .
Call 'd Rowland --
Will ye walk ? They 'll think we are lost : Come Gentlemen .
You have wip 'd him now .
So will he never the wench , I hope .
I wish it. [ Exeunt .
Rowland and Livia .
Now Livia , if you 'll go away to night , If your affections be not made of words .
I love you , and you know how dearly Rowland , Is there none near us ? my affections everHave been your servants ; with what superstitionI have ever Sainted you --
Why then take this way .
'Twill be a childish , and a less prosperous course , Than his that knows not care : why should we do , Our honest and our hearty love such wrong , To over-run our fortunes ?
Then you flatter .
Alas , you know I can not .
What hope 's left elseBut flying to enjoy ye ?
None so far , For let it be admitted , we have time , And all things now in other expectation , My father 's bent against us ; what but ruine , Can such a by-way bring us ? if your fearsWould let you look with my eyes , I would shew you , And certain , how our staying here would win usA course , though somewhat longer , yet far surer .
And then Moroso h'as ye .
No such matterFor hold this certain , begging , stealing , whoring , Selling ( which is a sin unpardonable ) Of counterfeit Cods , or musty English Croacus ; Switches , or Stones for th ' tooth-ache sooner finds me , Than that drawn Fox Moroso .
But his money , If wealth may win you --
If a Hog may beHigh Priest among the Jews ? his money Rowland ? Oh Love forgive me , what faith hast thou ? Why , can his money kiss me ?
Yes .
Behind , Laid out upon a Petticoat : or graspe meWhile I cry , Oh good thank you ? o'my trothThou mak'st me merry with thy fear : or lie with me.As you may do ? alas , what fools you men are ? His mouldy money ? half a dozen Riders , That can not sit , but stampt fast to their Saddles ? No Rowland , no man shall make use of me ; My beauty was born free , and free I 'll give itTo him that loves , not buys me. You yet doubt me .
I can not say I doubt ye .
Goe thy ways , Thou art the prettiest puling piece of passion : Y'faith I will not fail thee .
I had rather --
Prethee believe me , if I do not carry it , For both our goods --
But --
What but ?
I would tell you .
I know all you can tell me ; all 's but this , You would have me , and lie with me ; is't not so ?
Yes .
Why you shall ; will that content you ? Goe .
I am very loth to goe .
Byancha and Maria .
Now o ' my conscienceThou art an honest fellow : here 's my Sister ; Go , prethee go ; this kiss , and credit me , E'r I am three nights older , I am for thee : You shall hear what I do.Farewel .
Farewel. [ Exit Rowland .
Alas poor fool , how it looks ! It would ev'n hang it self , should I but cross it.For pure love to the matter I must hatch it .
Nay , never look for merry hour , Maria , If now you make it not ; let not your blushes , Your modesty , and tenderness of spirit , Make you continual Anvile to his anger : Believe me , since his first wife set him going , Nothing can bind his rage : Take your own council , You shall not say that I perswaded you.But if you suffer him --
Stay , shall I do it ?
Have you a stomach to't ?
I never shew 'd it .
'Twill shew the rarer and the stronger in you.But do not say I urg 'd you .
I am perfect , Like Curtius , to redeem my Countrey , I haveLeap 'd into this gulph of marriage , and I 'll do it.Farewel all poorer thoughts , but spight and anger , Till I have wrought a miracle. Now cosin , I am no more the gentle , tame Maria ; Mistake me not ; I have a new soul in meMade of a North wind , nothing but tempest ; And like a tempest shall it make all ruin , Till I have run my Will out .
This is brave now , If you continue it ; but your own Will lead you .
Adieu all tenderness , I dare continue ; Maids that are made of fears , and modest blushes , View me , and love example .
Here is your Sister .
Here is the brave old mans love .
That loves the young man .
I and hold thee there wench : what a grief of heart is't ? When Paphos Revels should rowze up old night , To sweat against a Cork ; to lie and tellThe clock o'th lungs , to rise sport starv 'd ?
Dear Sister , Where have you been , you talk thus ?
Why at Church , wench ; Where I am ti 'd to talke thus : I am a wife now .
It seems so , and a modest .
You are an ass ; When thou art married once , thy modestyWill never buy thee pins .
'Bless me .
From what ?
From such a tame fool as our cosin Livia ?
You are not mad .
Yes wench , and so must you be , Or none of our acquaintance : mark me Livia ; Or indeed fit for our sex : 'T is bed time.Pardon me yellow Hymen , that I meanThine offerings to protract , or to keep fastingMy valiant Bridegroom .
Whither will this woman ?
You may perceive her end .
Or rather fear it .
Dare you be partner i n't ?
Leave it Maria , I fear I have mark 'd too much , for goodness leave it ; Divest you with obedient hands , to bed .
To bed ? no Livia , there are Comets hangProdigious over that yet ; there 's a fellowMust yet before I know that heat ( ne'r start wench ) Be made a man , for yet he is a monster ; Here must his head be Livia .
Never hope it.'Tis as easie with a Sive to scoop the Ocean , asTo tame Petruchio .
Stay : Lucina hear me , Never unlock the treasure of my wombFor humane fruit , to make it capable ; Nor never with thy secret hand make briefA mothers labor to me ; if I doGive way unto my married Husband 's Will , Or be a Wife in any thing but hopes , Till I have made him easie as a child , And tame as fear , he shall not win a smile , Or a pleas 'd look , from this austerity , Though it would pull another Joynture from him , And make him ev'ry day another man ; And when I kiss him , till I have my Will , May I be barren of delights , and knowOnly what pleasures are in dreams , and guesses .
A strange Exordium .
All the several wrongsDone by Imperious Husbands to their WivesThese thousand years and upwards , strengthen thee : Thou hast a brave cause .
And I 'll do it bravely , Or may I knit my life out ever after .
In what part of the world got she this spirit ? Yet pray Maria , look before you truly , Besides the obedience of a wife ; Which you will find a heavy imputation , Which yet I can not think your own , it shewsSo distant from your sweetness .
'T is I swear .
Weigh but the person , and the hopes you have , To work this desperate cure .
A weaker subjectWould shame the end I aim at , disobedience.You talk too tamely : By the faith I haveIn mine own noble Will , that childish womanThat lives a prisoner to her Husbands pleasure , Has lost her making , and becomes a beast , Created for his use , not fellowship .
His first wife said as much .
She was a fool , And took a scurvy course ; let her be nam'd'Mongst those that wish for things , but dare not do'em : I have a new dance for him .
Are you of this faith ?
Yes truly , and will die i n't .
Why then let 's all wear breeches .
Now thou com'st near the nature of a woman ; Hang these tame hearted Eyasses , that no soonerSee the Lure out , and hear their Husbands hollow , But cry like Kites upon 'em : The free Haggard ( Which is that woman , that hath wing , and knows it , Spirit and plume ) will make an hundred checks , To shew her freedom , sail in ev'ry air , And look out ev'ry pleasure ; not regardingLure , nor quarry , till her pitch commandWhat she desires , making her foundred keeperBe glad to fling out trains , and golden ones , To take her down again .
You are learned , Sister ; Yet I say still take heed .
A witty saying ; I 'll tell thee Livia , had this fellow tiredAs many wives as horses under him , With spurring of their patience ; had he gotA Patent , with an Office to reclaim us , Confirm 'd by Parliament ; had he all the maliceAnd subtilty of Devils , or of us , Or any thing that 's worse than both .
Hey , hey boys , this is excellent .
Or could heCast his wives new again , like Bels , to make 'emSound to his Will ; or had the fearful nameOf the first breaker of wild women : yet , Yet would I undertake this man , thus single , And , spight of all the freedom he has reach 'd to , Turn him and bend him as I list , and mold himInto a babe again ; that aged women , W [ a ] nting both teeth and spleen , may Master him .
Thou wilt be chronicl 'd .
That 's all I aim at .
I must confess , I do with all my heartHate an imperious Husband , and in timeMight be so wrought upon .
To make him cuckold ?
If he deserve it .
Then I 'll leave ye Ladies .
Thou hast not so much noble anger in thee .
Go sleep , go sleep , what we intend to do , Lies not for such starv 'd souls , as thou hast Livia .
Good night : the Bridegroom will be with you presently .
That 's more than you know .
If ye work upon him , As you have promised , ye may give example , Which no doubt will be followed .
So .
Good night : we 'll trouble you no further .
If you intend no good , pray do no harm .
None , but pray for you. [ Exit Livia .
Cheer wench .
Now Byancha , Those wits we have , let 's wind 'em to the height.My rest is up wench , and I pull for thatWill make me ever famous. They that layFoundations , are half-builders , all men say .
Jaques .
My Master forsooth .
Oh how does thy Master ? prethee commend me to him .
How 's this ? my Master stays forsooth .
Why let him stay , who hinders him forsooth ?
The Revel 's ended now , To visit you .
I am not sick .
I mean to see his chamber forsooth .
Am I his Groom ? where lay he last night forsooth ?
In the low matted Parlour .
There lies his way by the long Gallery .
I mean your chamber : y'are very merry Mistriss .
'T is a good sign I am sound hearted Jaques : But if you 'll know where I lie , follow me ; And what thou seest , deliver to thy Master .
Do gentle Jaques. [ Exeunt .
Ha , is the wind in that door ? By'r Lady we shall have foul weather then : I do not like the shuffling of these women , They are mad beasts , when they knock their heads together : I have observ 'd them all this day ; their whispers , One in anothers ear , their signs and pinches , And breaking often into violent laughters : As if the end they purpos 'd were their own.Call you this weddings ? Sure this is a knavery , A very trick , and dainty knavery , Marvellous finely carried , that 's the comfort : What would these women do in ways of honor ? That are such Masters this way ? Well , my SirHas been as good at finding out these toys , As any living ; if he lose it now , At his own peril be it. I must follow. [ Exit .
, Petruchio , Petronius , Moroso , Tranio , and Sophocles .
You that are married , Gentlemen ; have at yeFor a round wager now .
Of this nights Stage ?
Yes .
I am your first man , a pair of Gloves of twenty shillings .
Done : who takes me up next ? I am for all bets .
Well lusty Lawrence , were but my night now , Old as I am , I would make you clap on Spurs , But I would reach you , and bring you to your trot too : I would Gallants .
Well said good Will ; but where 's the staff boy , ha ? Old father Time , your hour-glass is empty .
A good tough train would break thee all to pieces ; Thou hast not breath enough to say thy prayers .
See how these boys despise us. Will you to bed son ? This pride will have a fall .
Upon your daughter ; But I shall rise again , if there be truthIn Eggs , and butter 'd Parsnips .
Will you to bed son , and leave talking ? To morrow morning we shall have you look , For all your great words , like St. George at Kingston , Running a foot-back from the furious Dragon , That with her angry tail belabours himFor being lazie .
His courage quench 'd , and so far quench 'd --
'T is well Sir.What then ?
Fly , fly , quoth then the fearful dwarfe ; Here is no place for living man .
Well my masters , if I do sink under my business , as I find'tis very possible , I am not the first that has miscarried ; So that'smy comfort , what may be done without impeach or waste , I can and willdo .
Jaques.How now , is my fair Bride a bed ?
No truly , Sir .
Not a bed yet ? body o ' me : we 'll up and rifle her : here 's acoil with a Maiden-head , 't is not intail 'd , is it ?
If it be , I 'll try all the Law i'th ' Land , but I 'll cut it
That you can not neither .
Why ?
Unless you 'll drop through the Chimney like a Daw , or force abreach i'th ' windows : you may untile the house , 't is possible .
What dost thou mean ?
A moral , Sir , the Ballad will express it : The wind and the rain , has turned you back again , And you can not be lodged there. The truth is , all the doorsAre baracadoed ; not a Cathole , but holds a murd'rer in't.She 's victuall 'd for this month .
Art not thou drunk ?
He 's drunk , he 's drunk ; come , come , let 's up .
Yes , yes , I am drunk : ye may go up , ye mayGentlemen , but take heed to your heads : I say no more .
I 'll try that. [ Exit Soph .
How dost thou say ? the door fast lock 'd fellow ?
Yes truly Sir , 't is lock 'd , and guarded too ; and two asdesperate tongues planted behind it , as e'er yet batter 'd : they standupon their honors , and will not give up without strange composition , I 'll assure you ; marching away with their Pieces cockt , and Bulletsin their mouths , will not satisfie them .
How 's this ? how 's this ? they are -- Is there another with her ?
Yes marry is there , and an Enginier .
Who 's that for Heavens sake ?
Colonel Byancha , she commands the works : Spinola 's but aDitcher to her , there 's a half-moon : I am but a poor man , but ifyou 'll give me leave , I 'll venture a years wages , draw all your forcebefore it , and mount your ablest Piece of battery , you shall not enterit these three nights yet .
Sophocles .
I should laugh at that good Jaques .
Beat back again , she 's fortified for ever .
Am I drunk now , Sir ?
He that dares most , go up now , and be cool'd.I have scap 'd a pretty scowring .
What are they mad ? have we another Bedlam ? They do not talke I hope ?
Oh terribly , extreamly fearful , the noise at London-bridgeis nothing near her .
How got she tongue ?
As you got tail , she was born to't .
Lock 'd out a doors , and on my wedding-night ? Nay , and I suffer this , I may goe graze : Come Gentlemen , I 'll batter ; are these virtues ?
Do , and be beaten off with shame , as I was : I went up , cameto th ' door , knock 'd , no body answer 'd ; knock 'd louder , yet heard
flew from the window with such violence , that had I not duck 'd quicklylike a Fryer , cætera quis nescit ? The chamber 's nothing but a mere
, in every window Pewter Cannons mounted , you 'll quickly findwith what they are charg 'd , Sir .
Why then tantara for us .
And all the lower Works lin 'd sure with small shot , longtongues with Fire-locks , that at twelve score blank hit to the heart : now and ye dare go up .
Maria and Byanca above .
The window opens , beat a parley first ; I am so much amaz 'd , my very hair stands .
Why how now Daughter : what intrench 'd ?
A little guarded for my safety , Sir .
For your safety Sweet-heart ? why who offends you ? I come not to use violence .
I think you can not , Sir , I am better fortified .
I know your end , You would fain reprieve your Maiden-headA night , or two .
Yes , or ten , or twenty , or say an hundred ; Or indeed , till I list lie with you .
That 's a shrewd saying ; from this present hour , I never will believe a silent woman.When they break out they are bonfires .
Till you list lie with him ? why who are you Madam ?
That trim Gentlemans wife , Sir .
Cry you mercy , do you command too ?
Yes marry does she , and in chief .
I do command , and you shall go without : ( I mean your wife , for this night )
And for the next too wench , and so as ' [ t follows ]
Thou wilt not , wilt'a ?
Yes indeed dear father , And till he seal to what I shall set down , For any thing I know for ever .
Indeed these are Bug [ s ] -words .
You hear Sir , she can talk , God be thanked .
I would I heard it not , Sir .
I find that all the pity bestow 'd upon this woman , Makes but an Anagram of an ill wife , For she was never virtuous .
You 'll let me in I hope , for all this jesting .
Hope still , Sir .
You will come down I am sure .
I am sure I will not .
I 'll fetch you then .
The power of the whole County can not , Sir , Unless we please to yield , which yet I thinkWe shall not ; charge when you please , you shallHear quickly from us .
Bless me from a chicken of thy hatching , Is this wiving ?
Prethee Maria tell me what 's the reason , And doe it freely , you deal thus strangely with me ? You were not forc 'd to marry , your consentWent equally with mine , if not before it : I hope you do not doubt I want that mettleA man should have to keep a woman waking ; I would be sorry to be such a Saint yet : My person , as it is not excellent , So 't is not old , nor lame , nor weak with Physick , But well enough to please an honest woman , That keeps her house , and loves her Husband .
'T is so .
My means and my conditions are no shamersOf him that owes 'em , all the world knows that , And my friends no reliers on my fortunes .
All this I believe , and none of all these parcelsI dare [ ex ] cept against ; nay more , so farI am from making these the ends I aim at , These idle outward things , these womens fears , That were I yet unmarried , free to chooseThrough all the Tribes of man , I 'll take PetruchioIn 's shirt , with one ten Groats to pay the Priest , Before the best man living , or the ablestThat e'er leap 'd out of Lancashire , and they are right ones .
Why do you play the fool then , and stand pratingOut of the window like a broken Miller !
If you will have me credit you Maria , Come down , and let your love confirm it .
Stay there , Sir , that bargain 's yet to make .
Play sure wench , the Packs in thine own hand .
Let me die lowsie , if these two wenchesBe not brewing knavery to stock a Kingdom .
Why this is a Riddle : I love you , and I love you not .
It is so : And till your own experience do untie it , This distance I must keep .
If you talk more , I am angry , very angry .
I am glad o n't , and I will talk .
Prethee peace , Let me not think thou art mad. I tell thee woman , If thou goest forward , I am still Petruchio .
And I am worse , a woman that can fearNeither Petruchio Furius , nor his fame , Nor any thing that tends to our allegeance ; There 's a short method for you , now you know me .
If you can carry't so , 't is very well .
No , you shall carry it , Sir .
Peace gentle Low-bel .
Use no more words , but come down instantly , I charge thee by the duty of a child .
Prethee come Maria , I forgive all .
Stay there ; That duty , that you charge me by ( If you consider truly what you say ) Is now another man 's , you gave't awayI ' th ' Church , if you remember , to my Husband : So all you can exact now , is no moreBut only a due reverence to your person , Which thus I pay : Your blessing , and I am goneTo bed for this night .
This is monstrous : That blessing that St. Dunstan gave the Devil , If I were neer thee , I would give thee -- Pull thee down by th ' nose .
Saints should not rave , Sir ; A little Rubarb now were excellent .
Then by that duty you owe to me Maria , Open the door , and be obedient : I am quiet yet .
I do confess that duty , make your best o n't .
Why give me leave , I will .
Sir , there 's no learningAn old stiff Jade to trot , you know the moral .
Yet as I take it , Sir , I owe no moreThan you owe back again .
You will not Article ? All I owe , presently , let me but up , I 'll pay .
Y'are too hot , and such prove Jades at length ; You do confess a duty , or respect to me from you again : That 's very near , or full the same with mine ?
Yes .
Then by that duty , or respect , or whatYou please to have it , go to bed and leave me , And trouble me no longer with your fooling ; For know , I am not for you .
Well , what remedy ?
A fine smart Cudgel. Oh that I were near thee .
If you had teeth now , what a case were we in !
These are the most authentique Rebels , next
, I ever read of .
A week hence , or a fortnight , as you bear you , And as I find my will observ 'd , I may , With intercession of some friends , be broughtMay be to kiss you ; and so quarterlyTo pay a little Rent by composition , You understand me ?
Thou Boy thou .
Well there are more Maids than Maudlin , that 's my comfort .
Yes , and more men than Michael .
I must not to bed with this stomach , and no meat Lady .
Feed where you will , so it be sound and wholsome , Else live at Livery , for I 'll none with you .
You had best back one of the Dairy Maids , they 'll carry.But take heed to your girths , you 'll get a bruise else .
Now if thou wouldst come down and tender me : All the delights due to a marriage-bed , Study such kisses as would melt a man , And turn thy self into a thousand Figures , To add new flames unto me , I would standThus heavy , thus regardless , thus despisingThee , and thy best allurings : all the beautyThat 's laid upon your bodies , mark me well , For without doubt your mind 's are miserable , You have no Masques for them : all this rare beauty , Lay but the Painter and the Silk-worm by , The Doctor with his Dyets , and the Tailor , And you appear like flea 'd Cats , not so handsome .
And we appear like her that sent us hither , That only excellent and beauteous nature ; Truly our selves for men to wonder at , But too divine to handle ; we are Gold , In our own natures pure ; but when we sufferThe husbands stamp upon us , then allays , And base ones of you men are mingled with us , And make us blush like Copper .
Then , and neverTill then are women to be spoken of , For till that time you have no souls I take it : Good night : come Gentlemen ; I 'll fast for this night , But by this hand , well ; I shall come up yet .
No .
There will I watch thee like a wither 'd Jury , Thou shalt neither have meat , Fire , nor Candle , Nor any thing that 's easie : do you rebel so soon ? Yet take mercy .
Put up your Pipes : to bed Sir , I 'll assure youA months siege will not shake us .
Well said Colonel .
To bed , to bed Petruchio : good night Gentlemen , You 'll make my Father sick with sitting up : Here you shall find us any time these ten days , Unless we may march off with our contentment .
I 'll hang first .
And I 'll quarter if I do not , I 'll make you know , and fear a wife Petruchio , There my cause lies.You have been famous for a woman-tamer , And bear the fear'd-name of a brave Wife-breaker : A woman now shall take those honors off , And tame you ; nay , never look so bigg , she shall , believe me , And I am she : what think ye ; good night to all , Ye shall find Centinels .
If ye dare sally. [ Exeunt above .

I 'll devil 'em : by these ten bones I will : I 'll bring it tothe old Proverb , no sport no pie : -- -- taken down i'th ' top of all myspeed ; this is fine dancing : Gentlemen , stick to me. You see ourFreehold 's touch 'd , and by this light , we will beleagure 'em , andeither starve 'em out , or make 'em recreant .
I 'll see all passages stopt , but those about 'em : If the good women of the Town dare succor 'em , We shall have wars indeed .
I 'll stand perdue upon 'em .
My Regiment shall lie before .
I think so , 't is grown too old to stand .
Let 's in , and each provide his tackle , We 'll fire 'em out , or make 'em take their pardons : Hear what I say on their bare knees -- Am I Petruchio , fear 'd , and spoken of , And on my wedding night am I thus jaded ? [ Exeunt omn .

To view the Works .
What Works ?

The Fox is kennell 'd for me : save you Sir .
Why do you look so strange ?
I use to look SirWithout examination .
Twenty Spur-Royals for that word .
Belike thenThe object discontents you ?
Yes it does .
Is't come to this ? you know me , do you not ?
Yes , as I may know many by repentance .
Why do you break your faith ?
I 'll tell you that too , You are under age , and no band holds upon you .
Excellent wench .
Sue out your understanding , And get more hair to cover your bare knuckle ; ( For boys were made for nothing , but dry kisses ) And if you can , more manners .
Better still .
And then if I want Spanish Gloves , or Stockings , A ten pound Wastecoat , or a Nag to hunt on , It may be I shall grace you to accept 'em .
Farewel , and when I credit women more , May I to Smithfield , and there buy a Jade , ( And know him to be so ) that breaks my neck .
Because I have known you , I 'll be thus kind to you ; Farewel , and be a man , and I 'll provide you , Because I see y'are desperate , some staid Chamber-maidThat may relieve your youth with wholsome doctrine .

A Box o'th ' ear do you say ?
Yes sure , a sound one , Beside my nose blown to my hand ; if CupidShoot Arrows of that weight , I 'll swear devoutly , H'as sued his Livery , and is no more a boy .
You gave her some ill language ?
Not a word .
Or might be you were fumbling ?
Would I had Sir.I had been a forehand then ; but to be baffl 'd , And have no feeling of the cause --
Be patient , I have a medicine clapt to her back will cure her .
No sure it must be afore , Sir .
O ' my conscience , When I got these two wenches ( who till nowNe'r shew 'd their riding ) I was drunk with Bastard , Whose nature is to form things like it selfHeady , and monstrous : did she slight him too ?
That 's all my comfort : a meer Hobby-horseShe made child Rowland : s'foot she would not know him , Not give him a free look , not reckon himAmong her thoughts , which I held more than wonder , I having seen her within 's three days kiss himWith such an appetite as though she would eat him .
There is some trick in this : how did he take it ?
Ready to cry ; he ran away .
I fear her.And yet I tell you , ever to my anger , She is as tame as innocency ; it may beThis blow was but a favour .
I 'll be sworn 't was well tied on then .
Goe too , pray forget it , I have bespoke a Priest : and within 's two hoursI 'll have ye married ; will that please you ?
Yes .
I 'll see it done my self , and give the LadySuch a sound exhortation for this knaveryI 'll warrant you , shall make her smell this month o n't .
Nay good Sir be not violent .
Neither --
It may beOut of her earnest love there grew a longing ( As you know women have such toys ) in kindness , To give me a box o'th ' ear , or so .
It may be .
I reckon for the best still : this night thenI shall enjoy her .
You shall handsel her .
Old as I am , I 'll give her one blow for'tShall make her groan this twelve-month .
Where 's your Joynture ?
I have a Joynture for her .
Have your Council perus 'd it yet ?
No Council but the night , and your sweet daughter , Shall e'r peruse that joynture .
Very well , Sir .
I 'll no demurrers o n't , nor no rejoynders.The other 's ready seal 'd .
Come then let 's comfortMy Son Petruchio , he 's like little ChildrenThat loose their baubles , crying ripe .
Pray tell me , Is this stern woman still upon the flauntOf bold defiance ?
Still , and still she shall be , Till she be starv 'd out , you shall see such justice , That women shall be glad after this tempest , To tie their husbands shooes , and walk their horses .
That were a merry world : do you hear the rumor ? They say the women are in insurrection , And mean to make a --

A friend .
Who are you ?
Look out and know .
Alas poor wench , who sent thee ? What weak fool made thy tongue his Orator ? I know you come to parly .
Y'are deceiv 'd , Urg 'd by the goodness of your cause , I comeTo do as you do .
Y'are too weak , too foolish , To cheat us with your smoothness : do not we knowThou hast been kept up tame ?
Believe me .
No , prethee good LiviaUtter thy Eloquence somewhere else .
Good CosinPut up your Pipes ; we are not for your palateAlas we know who sent you .
O ' my word --
Stay there ; you must not think your word , Or by your Maidenhead , or such Sunday oaths , Sworn after Even-Song , can inveigle usTo lose our hand-fast : did their wisdoms thinkThat sent you hither , we would be so foolish , To entertain our gentle Sister Sinon , And give her credit , while the wooden Jade
stole upon us : no good Sister , Go home , and tell the merry Greeks that sent you,
shall burn , and I , as did Æneas , Will on my back , spite of the Myrmidons , Carry this warlike Lady , and through SeasUnknown , and unbeliev 'd , seek out a Land , Where like a race of noble AmazonsWe 'll root our se [ l ] ves , and to our endless gloryLive , and despise base men .
I 'll second ye .
How long have you been thus ?
That 's all one , Cosin , I stand for freedom now .
Take heed of lying ; For by this light , if we do credit you , And find you tripping , his inflictionThat kill 'd the Prince of Orange , will be sportTo what we purpose .
Let me feel the heaviest .
Swear by thy Sweet-heart Rowland ( for by your maiden-head , I fear 'twill be too late to swear ) you meanNothing but fair and safe , and honourableTo us , and to your self .
I swear .
Stay yet , Swear as you hate Moroso , that 's the surest , And as you have a certain fear to find himWorse than a poor dry 'd Jack , full of more achesThan Autumn has ; more knavery , and usury , And foolery , and brokery , than dogs-ditch : As you do constantly believe he 's nothingBut an old empty bag with a grey beard , And that Beard such a bob-tail , that it looksWorse than a Mares tail eaten off with Fillies : As you acknowledge that young handsome wenchThat lies by such a Bilboa blade that bendsWith ev'ry pass he makes , to th ' hilts , [ most ] miserable , A dry Nurse to his Coughs , a fewtererTo such a nasty fellow , a robb 'd thingOf all delights youth looks for : and to end , One cast away on course beef , born to brushThat everlasting Cassock that has wornAs many servants out , as the Northeast passageHas consum 'd Sailors : if you swear this , and trulyWithout the reservation of a gownOr any meritorious Petticoat , 'T is like we shall believe you .
I do swear it .
Stay yet a little ; came this wholsome motion ( Deal truly Sister ) from your own opinion , Or some suggestion of the Foe ?
Nev'r fear me , For by that little faith I have in Husbands , And the great zeal I bear your cause , I comeFull of that liberty you stand for , Sister .
If we believe , and you prove recreant , Livia , Think what a maim you give the noble CauseWe now stand up for : Think what women shall , An hundred years hence , speak thee , when examplesAre look 'd for , and so great ones , whose relations , Spoke as we do 'em wench , shall make new customs .
If you be false , repent , go home , and pray , And to the serious women of the CityConfess your self ; bring not a sin so hainousTo load thy soul to this place : mark me Livia , If thou be'st double , and betray'st our honors , And we fail in our purpose : get thee whereThere is no women living , nor no hopeThere ever shall be .
If a Mothers daughter , That ever heard the name of stubborn husbandFind thee , and know thy sin .
Nay , if old age , One that has worn away the name of woman , And no more left to know her by , but railing , No teeth , nor eyes , nor legs , but wooden onesCome but i'th ' wind-ward of thee , for sure she 'll smell thee ; Thou'lt be so rank , she 'll ride thee like a night-Mare , And say her Prayers back-ward to undo thee : She 'll curse thy meat and drink , and when thou marriest , Clap a sound spell for ever on thy pleasures .
Children of five year old , like little Fairies , Will pinch thee into motley : all that everShall live , and hear of thee , I mean all women , Will ( like so many furies ) shake their keys ; And toss their flaming distaffs o'r their heads , Crying revenge : take heed , 't is hideous : Oh 't is a fearful office , if thou hadst ( Though thou be'st perfect now ) when thou cam'st hither , A false imagination , get thee gone , And as my learned Cosin said , repent , This place is sought by soundness .
So I seek it , Or let me be a most despis 'd example .
I do believe thee , be thou worthy of it.You come not empty ?
No , here 's Cakes , and cold meat , And Tripe of proof : behold , here 's Wine and Beer , Be suddain , I shall be surpriz 'd else .
Meet at the low parlour door , there lies a close way : What fond obedience you have living in you , Or duty to a man before you enter , Fling it away , 'twill but defile our Off'rings .
Be wary as you come .
I warrant ye. [ Exeunt .

Rowland and Tranio at several doors .
Now Rowland ?
How doe you ?
How dost thou man ? Thou look'st ill:
Yes , pray can you tell me Tranio , Who knew the devil first ?
A woman .
So. Were they not well acquainted ?
May be so , For they had certain Dialogues together .
He sold her fruit , I take it ?
Yes , and CheeseThat choak 'd all mankind after .
Canst thou tell meWhether that woman ever had a faithAfter she had eaten ?
That 's a School-question
No , 'T is no question , for believe me Tranio , That cold fruit after eating bread naught in herBut windy promises , and chollick vowsThat broke out both ways. [ Thou ] hast heard I am sureOf Esculapius , a far famed Surgeon , One that could set together quarter 'd TraitorsAnd make 'em honest men .
How dost thou Rowland ?
Let him but take , ( if [ h ] e dare do a cureShall get him fame indeed ) a faithless woman , There will be credit for him , that will speak him , A broken woman Tranio , a base woman , And if he can cure such a rack of honorLet him come here , and practice .
Now for honors sake , Why what ail'st thou Rowland ?
I am ridden Tranio.And spur-gall 'd to the life of patience ( Heaven keep my wits together ) by a thingOur worst thoughts are too noble for , a woman .
Your Mistriss has a little frown 'd it may be ?
She was my Mistriss .
Is she not ?
No Tranio.She has done me such disgrace , so spitefullySo like a woman bent to my undoing , That henceforth a good horse shall be my Mistriss , A good Sword , or a Book : and if you see her , Tell her I [ doe ] beseech you , even for love sake. --
I will Rowland .
She may soonerCount the good I have thought her , Our old love and our friendship , Shed one true tear , mean one hour constantly , Be old and honest , married , and a maid , Than make me see her more , or more believe her : And now I have met a messenger , farewel Sir. [ Exit .
Alas poor Rowland , I will do it for thee : This is that dog Moroso , but I hopeTo see him cold i'th ' mouth first , e'r he enjoy her : I 'll watch this young man , desperate thoughts may seize him , And if my purse or council can , I 'll ease him. [ Exit .
Petruchio , Petronius , Moroso , and Sophocles .
For look you Gentlemen , say that I grant her , Out of my free and liberal love , a pardon , Which you , and all men else know , she deserves not,
can all the world leave laughing ?
I think not .
No by -- -- they can not ; For pray consider , have you ever read , Or heard of , or can any man imagine.So stiff a Tom-boy , of so set a malice , And such a brazen resolution , As this young Crab-tree ? and then answer me , And mark but this too friends , without a cause , Not a foul word come cross her , not a fear , She justly can take hold on , and do you thinkI must sleep out my anger , and endure it , Sow pillows to her ease , and lull her mischief ? Give me a Spindle first : no , no my Masters , Were she as fair as Nell-a-Greece , and housewife , As good as the wise Sailors wife , and young still , Never above fifteen , and these tricks to it , She should ride the wild Mare once a week , she should , ( Believe me friends she should ) I would tabor her , Till all the Legions that are crept into her , Flew out with fire i'th ' tails .
Methinks you err now , For to me seems , a little sufferanceWere a far surer cure .
Yes , I can suffer , Where I see promises of peace and amendment .
Give her a few conditions .
I 'll be hanged first .
Give her a Crab-tree Cudgel .
So I will ; And after it a flock-bed for her bones.And hard eggs , till they brace her like a Drum , She shall be pamper 'd with -- -- She shall not know a stool in ten months , Gentlemen .
This must not be .
Jaques .
Arm , arm , out with your weapons , For all the women in the Kingdom 's on ye ;
Pedro.They swarm like wasps , and nothing can destroy 'em , But stopping of their hive , and smothering of 'em,
Stand to your guard , Sir , all the devils extantAre broke upon us like a cloud of thunder ; There are more women marching hitherward , In rescue of my Mistriss , than e'er turn 'd tailAt Sturbridge Fair , and I believe , as fiery .
Lo you fierce Petruchio , this comes of your impatience .
There 's one brought in the Bears against the CanonsOf the Town , made it good , and fought 'em .
Another to her everlasting fame , erectedTwo Ale-houses of ease : the Quarter-SessionsRunning against her roundly ; in which businessTwo of the disanullers lost their night-caps : A third stood excommunicate by the cudgel ; The Constable , to her eternal glory , Drunk hard , and was converted , and she victor .
Then are they victualed with Pies and Puddings , ( The trappings of good Stomachs ) noble AleThe true defender , Sausages , and smoak 'd ones , If need be , such as serve for Pikes ; and Pork , ( Better the Jews ne'r hated : ) here and thereA bottle of Metheglin , a stout BritainThat will stand to 'em ; what else they want , they war for .
Come to council .
Now you must grant conditions , or the KingdomWill have no other talke but this .
Away then , and let 's advise the best .
Why do you tremble ?
Have I liv 'd thus long to be knockt o'th ' head , With half a Washing-beetle : pray be wise , Sir .
Come , something I 'll do , but what it is , I know not .
To Council then , and let 's avoid their follies.Guard all the doors , or we shall not have a Cloak left. [ Exeunt .

Petronius , Petruchio , Moroso , Sophocles , and Tranio .
I am indifferent , though I must confess , I had rather see her carted .
No more of that , Sir .
Are ye resolv 'd to give her fair conditions ? 'Twill be the safest way .
I am distracted , Would I had run my head into a halterWhen I first woo 'd her : if I offer peace , She 'll urge her own conditions , that 's the devil .
Why , say she do ?
Say , I am made an Ass , then ; I know her aim : may I , with reputation ( Answer me this ) with safety of mine honor , ( After the mighty manage of my first wife , Which was indeed a fury to this Filly , After my twelve strong labours to reclaim her , Which would have made Don Hercules horn mad , And hid him in his Hide ) suffer this Cicely ? E 're she have warm 'd my sheets , e 're grappell 'd with me , This Pinck , this painted Foist , this Cockle-boat , To hang her Fights out , and defie me friends , A well known man of war ? if this be equal , And I may suffer , say , and I have done ?
I do not think you may .
You 'll make it worse , Sir .
Pray hear me good Petruchio : but ev'n now , You were contented to give all conditions , To try how far she would carry : 'T is a folly , ( And you will find it so ) to clap the curb on , E 're you be sure it proves a natural wildness , And not a forc'd. Give her conditions , For on my life this trick is put into her .
I should believe so too .
And not her own .
You 'll find it so .
Then if she flownder with you , Clap spurs on , and in this you 'll deal with temperance , Avoid the hurry of the world .

Why [ God ] hold it .
Now Jaques ?
They are i'th ' flaunt , Sir .
Yes we hear 'em .
They have got a stick of Fiddles , and they firk it , In wondrous ways , the two grand Capitano 's , ( They brought the Auxiliary Regiments ) Dance with their coats tuckt up to their bare breeches , And bid [ them ] kiss 'em , that 's the burden ; They have got Metheglin , and audacious Ale ; And talk like Tyrants .

Learnedly drunk , I 'll hang else : let her utter .
And I must tell you , viva voce friend , A very foolish fellow .
There 's an Ale figure .
I thank you Susan Brotes .
Forward Sister .
You have espoused here a hearty woman , A comly , and courageous .
Well , I have so .
And to the comfort of distressed damsels , Women out-worn in wedlock ; and such vessels , This woman has defied you .
It should seem so .
And why ?
Yes , can you tell ?
For thirteen causes .
Pray by your patience Mistriss .
Forward Sister .
Do you mean to treat of all these ?
Who shall let her ?
Do you hear , Velvet hood , we come not nowTo hear your doctrine .
For the first , I take it , It doth divide it self into seven branches .
Hark you good Maria , Have you got a Catechiser here ?
Good zeal .
Good three pil 'd predication , will you peace , And hear the cause we come for ?
Yes bob-tailsWe know the cause you come for , here 's the cause , But never hope to carry her , never dreamOr flatter your opinions with a thoughtOf base repentance in her .
Give me Sack , By this , and next strong Ale .
Swear forward Sister .
By all that 's cordial , in this place we 'll buryOur bones , fames , tongues , our triumphs and [ then ] allThat ever yet was chronicl 'd of woman ; But this brave wench , this excellent despiser , This bane of dull obedience , shall inheritHis liberal Will , and march off with conditionsNoble , and worth her self .
She shall Tom Tilers , And brave ones too , my Hood shall make a Hearse-cloth , And I 'll lie under it like Jone o ' Gaunt , E'r I go less , my Distaff stuck up by me , For the eternal Trophy of my conquests ; And loud fame at my head with two main bottles , Shall fill to all the world the glorious fallOf old Don Gillian .
Yet a little further , We have taken Arms in rescue of this Lady ; Most just and Noble : if ye beat us offWithout conditions , and we recant , Use us as we deserve ; and first degrade usOf all our antient chambring : next thatThe Symbols of our secresie , silk Stockings , Hew of our heels ; our petticoats of ArmsTear off our bodies , and our Bodkins breakOver our coward heads .

No more wars : puissant Ladies , shew conditionsAnd freely I accept 'em .
Call in Livia ; She 's in the Treaty too .
Livia above .
How , Livia ?
Hear you that Sir ? There 's the conditions for ye , pray peruse 'em .
Yes , there she is : 't had been no right rebellion , Had she held off ; what think you man ?
Nay nothing.I have enough o ' th ' prospect : o ' my conscience , The worlds end , and the goodness of a womanWill come together .
Are you there sweet Lady ?
Cry you mercy Sir , I saw you not : your blessing .
Yes , when I bless a jade , that stumbles with me.How are the Articles ?
This is for you Sir ; And I shall think upo n't .
You have us 'd me finely .
There 's no other use of thee now extant , But to be hung up , Cassock , Cap , and all , For some strange monster at Apothecaries .
I hear you whore .
It must be his then Sir , For need will then compel me .
Blessing on thee. [ Liv. He wil undoe me in meere pans of ColesTo make him lustie . ]
There 's no talking to 'em ; How are they Sir ?
As I expected : Liberty and clothes , [ Reads.When , and in what way she will : continual moneys , Company , and all the house at her dispose ; No tongue to say , why is this ? or whether will it ; New Coaches , and some buildings , she appoints here ; Hangings , and Hunting-horses : and for PlateAnd Jewels for her private use , I take it , Two thousand pound in present : then for Musick , And women to read French ;
This must not be .
And at the latter end a clause put in , That Livia shall by no man be importun 'd , This whole month yet , to marry .
This is monstrous .
This shall be done , I 'll humor her awhile : If nothing but repentance and undoingCan win her love , I 'll make a shift for one .
When ye are once a bed , all these conditionsLie under your own seal .
Do you like 'em ?
Yes.And by that faith I gave you 'fore the PriestI 'll ratifie 'em .
Stay , what pledges ?
No , I 'll take that oath ; But have a care you keep it .
'T is not nowAs when Andrea liv 'd .
If you do juggle , Or alter but a Letter of these ArticlesWe have set down , the self-same persecution .
Mistrust him not .

Enough , I yield .
What 's this Inserted here ?
That the two valiant women that [ command ] hereShall have a Supper made 'em , and a large one , And liberal entertainment without grudging , And pay for all their soldiers .
That shall be too ; And if a Tun of Wine will serve to pay 'em , They shall have justice : I ordain ye allPay-masters , Gentlemen .
Then we shall have sport boys .

Tranio and Rowland .
Come you shall take my counsel .
I shall hang first.I 'll no more love , that 's certain , 't is a bane , ( Next that they poison Rats with ) the most mortal : No , I thank Heaven , I have got my sleep again , And now begin to write sence ; I can walk yeA long hour in my chamber like a man , And think of some thing that may better me ; Some serious point of Learning , or my state ; No more ay-mees , and [ miseries ] Tranio , Come near my brain. I 'll tell thee , had the devilBut any essence in him of a man , And could be brought to love , and love a woman , 'Twould make his head ake worser than his horns do ; And firk him with a fire he never felt yet , Would make him dance. I tell thee there is nothing ( It may be thy case Tranio , therefore hear me : ) Under the Sun ( reckon the mass of folliesCrept into th ' world with man ) so desperate , So mad , so senceless , poor and base , so wretched , Roguy , and scurvy .
Whether wilt thou Rowland ?
As 't is to be in love .
And why for virtue sake ?
And why for virtue 's sake ? dost thou not conceive me ?
No by my troth .
Pray then and heartily , For fear thou fall into't : I 'll tell thee why too , ( For I have hope to save thee ) when thou lovest , And first beginst to worship the gilt calf:
, thou hast lost thy gentry , And like a Prentice , flung away thy Freedom , Forthwith thou art a slave .
That 's a new Doctrine .
Next thou art no more man .
What then ?
A Fryppery ; Nothing but braided hair and penny ribbond , Glove , Garter , Ring , Rose , or at best a Swabber , If thou canst love so near to keep thy making , Yet thou wilt lose thy language .
Why ?
Oh Tranio , Those things in love , ne'r talk as we do .
No ?
No , without doubt , they sigh , and shake the head , And sometimes whistle dolefully .
No tongue ?
Yes Tranio , but no truth i n't , nor no reason , And when they cant ( for 't is a kind of canting ) Ye shall hear , if you reach to understand 'em ( Which you must be a fool first , or you can not ) Such gibb'rish ; such believe me , I protest Sweet , And oh dear Heavens , in which such constellationsReign at the births of Lovers , this is too well , And daigne me Lady , daigne me I beseech yeYou poor unworthy lump , and then she licks him .
A -- -- o n't , this is nothing .
Thou hast hit it : Then talks she ten times worse , and wryes , and wriggles , As though she had the Itch ( and so it may be . )
Why thou art grown a strange discoverer .
Of mine own follies Tranio .
Wilt thou Rowland , Certain ne'er love again ?
I think so , certain , And if I be not dead drunk I shall keep it .
Tell me but this ; what dost thou think of women ?
Why , as I think of Fiddles , they delight me , Till their strings break .
What strings ?
Their modesties , Faiths , Vows , and Maidenheads , for they are like KitsThey have but four strings to 'em .
What wilt thouGive me for ten pound now , when thou next lovest , And the same woman still ?
Give me the money ; A hundred , and my Bond for't .
But pray hear me , I 'll work all means I can to reconcile ye:
Do , do , Give me the money ;
There .
Work Tranio .
You shall go sometimes where she is .
Yes straight.This is the first good I e'er got by woman .
You would think it strange now , if another beautyAs good as hers , say better .
Well .
Conceive me , This is no point o ' th ' wager .
That 's all one .
Love you as much , or more , than now she hates you .
'T is a good hearing , let 'em love : ten pound more , I never love that woman .
There it is ; And so an hundred , if you lose .
'T is done ; Have you another to put in ?
No , no Sir .
I am very sorry : now will I erectA new game , and go hate for th ' bell ; I am sureI am in excellent case to win .
I must have leaveTo tell you , and tell truth too , what she is , And how she suffers for you .
Ten pound more , I never believe you .
No Sir , I am stinted .
Well , take your best way then .
Let 's walk , I am gladYour sullen Feavor 's off .
Shalt see me TranioA monstrous merry man now : let 's to the Wedding , And as we go , tell me the general hurryOf these mad wenches and their works .
I will .
And do thy worst .

That I believe too .
How did she entertain him ?

But scurvely .
With no great affectionThat I saw : and I heard some say he kiss 'd her , But 't was upon a treaty , and some copiesSay , but her Cheek .

Full as many P [ r ] ayersAs the most zealous Puritane conceivesOut of the meditation of fat Veal , Or Birds of prey , cram 'd Capons , against Players , And to as good a tune too , but against her : That heaven would bless me from her : mark it Pedro , If this house be not turn 'd within this fortnightWith the foundation upward , I 'll be carted.My comfort is yet , that those Amorites , That came to back her cause , those Heathen Whores , Had their Hoods hallowed with Sack .
How Div'lish drunk they were !
And how they tumbled , Pedro , Didst thou markeThe Countrey Cavaliero ?
Out upon her , How she turn 'd down the Bragget !
I that sunk her .
That Drink was well put to her ; What a Somer saltWhen the chair fel , she fetch 'd , with her heels upward !
And what a piece of Landskip she discover 'd !
Didst mark her , when her hood fell in the Posset ?
Yes , and there rid , like a Dutch-Hoy ; the Tumbrel , When she had got her ballasse .
That I saw too .
How fain she would have drawn on SophoclesTo come aboard , and how she simper 'd it --
I warrant her , she has been a worthy striker .
I'th heat of Summer there had been some hope o n't .
Hang her .
She offer 'd him a Harry-groat , and belcht out , Her stomach being blown with Ale , such Courtship , Upon my life has giv'n him twenty stools since : Believe my Calculation , these old Women , When they are tippled , and a little heated , Are like new wheels , they'l roare you all the Town oreTill they be greas 'd .
The City Cinque-a-paceDame Tost and Butter , had the Bob too ?
Yes , But she was sullen drunk , and given to filching , I see her offer at a Spoon ; my Master -- I do not like his look , I fear h'as fastedFor all this preparation ; lets steal by him. [ Exeunt .
Petruchio , and Sophocles .
Not let you touch her all this night ?
Not touch her .
Where was your courage ?
Where was her obedience ? Never poor Man was sham 'd so ; never RascalThat keeps a stud of Whores was us 'd so basely .
Pray you tell me one thing truly ; Do you love her ?
I would I did not , upon that conditionI past thee half my Land .
It may be then , Her modesty requir 'd a little violence ? Some Women love to struggle .
She had it , And so much that I sweat for't , so I did , But to no end : I washt an Ethiope ; She swore my force might weary her , but win herI never could , nor should , till she consented ; And I might take her body prisoner , But for her mind or appetite --
'T is strange ; This woman is the first I ever read of , Refus 'd a warranted occasion , And standing on so fair termes .
I shall quit her .
Us 'd you no more art ?
Yes , I swore to her , And by no little ones , if presentlyWithout more disputation on the matter , She grew not nearer to me , and dispatcht meOut of the [ pain ] I was , for I was nettl 'd , And willingly , and eagerly , and sweetly , I would to her Chamber-maid , and in her hearingBegin her such a huntes-up .
Then she started ?
No more than I do now ; marry she answeredIf I were so dispos 'd , she could not help it ; But there was one call 'd Jaques , a poor ButlerOne that might well content a single woman .
And he should tilt her .
To that sence , and lastShe bad me yet these six nights look for nothingNor strive to purchase it , but fair good nightAnd so good morrow , and a kiss or twoTo close my stomach , for her vow had seal 'd it , And she would keep it constant .
Stay ye , stay ye , Was she thus when you woo 'd her ?
Nothing Sophocles , More keenely eager , I was oft afraidShe had been light , and easie , she would showreHer kisses so upon me .
Then I fearAn other spoke 's i'th wheele .
Now thou hast found me , There gnawes my Devil , Sophocles , O patiencePreserve me ; that I make her not exampleBy some unworthy way ; as fleaing her , Boyling , or making verjuice , drying her .
I hear her .
Mark her then , and see the heirOf spight and prodigality , she has studiedA way to begger 's both , and by this hand [ Maria at the dore , and Servant and Woman.She shall be , if I live , a Doxy .
Fy Sir .
I do not like that dressing , tis too poor , Let me have six gold laces , broad and massy , And betwixt ev'ry lace a rich Embroydry , Line the Gown through with Plush perfum 'd , and purffleAll the sleeves down with Pearl .
What think you Sophocles.In what point stands my state now ?
For those hangingsLet'em be carried where I gave appointment , They are too base for my use , and bespeakNew Pieces of the Civil Wars of France , Let 'em be large and lively , and all silk work , The borders Gold .
I marry sir , this cuts it .
That fourteen yards of Satten give my Woman , I do not like the colour , 't is too civil : Ther 's too much Silk i'th lace too ; tell the DutchmanThat brought the Mares , he must with all speed send meAn other suit of Horses , and by all meansTen cast of Hawkes for th ' River , I much care notWhat price they bear , so they be sound , and flying , For the next Winter , I am for the Country ; And mean to take my pleasure ; where 's the Horseman ?
She means to ride a great Horse .
With a side sadle ?
Yes , and shee'l run a tilt within this twelvemonth .
To morrow I 'll begin to learn , but pray sirHave a great care he be an easie doer , 'Twill spoil a Scholar else .
An easie doer , Did you hear that ?
Yes , I shall meet her moralsEre it be long I fear not .
O good morrow .
Good morrow Lady , how is't now .
Faith sickly , This house stands in an ill ayr .
Yet more charges ?
Subject to rots , and rheums ; out o n't , 't is nothingBut a tild fog .
What think you of the Lodge then ?
I like the seat , but 't is too little , SophoclesLet me have thy opinion , thou hast judgment .
'T is very well .
What if I pluck it down , And build a square upon it , with two courtsStill rising from the entrance ?
And i'th midstA Colledge for young Scolds .
And to the SouthwardTake in a Garden of some twenty Acres , And cast it of the Italian fashion , hanging .
And you could cast your self so too ; pray LadyWill not this cost much Money ?
Some five thousand , Say six : I 'll have it Battel 'd too .
And gilt ; Maria , This is a fearful course you take , pray think o n't , You are a Woman now , a Wife , and hisThat must in honesty , and justice look forSome due obedience from you .
That bare wordShall cost you many a pound more , build upo n't ; Tell me of due obedience ? What 's a Husband ? What are we married for , to carry Sumpters ? Are we not one peece with you , and as worthyOur own intentions , as you yours ?
Pray hear me .
Take two small drops of water , equal weigh 'd , Tell me which is the heaviest , and which oughtFirst to descend in duty ?
You mistake me ; I urge not service from you , nor obedienceIn way of duty , but of love , and Credit ; All I expect is but a noble careOf what I have brought you , and of what I am , And what our name may be .
That 's in my making .
'T is true it is so .
Yes , it is Petruchio , For there was never Man without our molding , Without our stamp upon him , and our justice , Left any thing three ages after himGood , and his own .
Good Lady understand him .
I do too much , sweet Sophocles , he 's oneOf a most spightful self condition , Never at peace with any thing but Age , That has no teeth left to return his anger : A Bravery dwells in his blood yet , of abusingHis first good wife ; he 's sooner fire than powder , And sooner mischief .
If I be so sodainDo not you fear me ?
No nor yet care for you , And if it may be lawful , I defie you:
Do 's this become you now ?
It shall become me .
Thou disobedient , weak , vain-glorious woman , Were I but half so wilful , as thou spightful , I should now drag thee to thy duty .
Drag me ?
But I am friends again : take all your pleasure .
Now you perceive him Sophocles .
I love theeAbove thy vanity , thou faithless creature .
Would I had been so happy when I Married , But to have met an honest Man like thee , For I am sure thou art good , I know thou art honest , A hansome hurtless man , a loving man , Though never a penny with him ; and those eyes , That face , and that true heart ; weare this for my sake , And when thou think'st upon me pity me : I am cast away. [ Exit Mar .
Why how now man ?
Pray leave me , And follow your advices .
The Man 's jealous:
I shall find a time ere it be long , to ask youOne or two foolish questions .

This was your Mistriss once .
Yes .
Are ye honest ? I see you are young , and hansome .
I am honest .
Why that 's well said : and there 's no doubt your judgementIs good enough , and strong enough to tell youWho are your foes , and friends : Why did you leave her ?
She made a puppy of me .
Be that granted : She must do so sometimes , and oftentimes ; Love were too serious else .

Had you lov 'd me --
I would I had .
And dearly ; And I had lov 'd you so : you may love worse Sir , But that is not material .
I shall loose .
Some time or other for varietyI should have call 'd you Fool , or Boy , or bid youPlay with the Pages : but have lov 'd you still , Out of all question , and extreamly too ; You are a Man made to be loved .
This WomanEither abuses me , or loves me deadly .
I 'll tell you one thing , if I were to chooseA Husband to mine own mind , I should thinkOne of your Mothers making would content me , For o ' my Conscience she makes good ones .
Lady , I 'll leave you to your commendations : I am in again , The Divel take their tongues .
You shall not goe .
I will : yet thus far Livia , Your Sorrow may induce me to forgive you , But never love again ; if I stay longer , I have lost two hundred pound .
Good Sir , but thus much --

But one kiss of you ; One parting kiss , and I am gone too .

How you take it ? Thou get a Wench , thou get a dozen night-caps ? Wouldst have her come , and lick thee like a Calfe , And blow thy nose , and buss thee ?
Not so neither .
What wouldst thou have her do ?
Do as she [ sh ] ould do ; Put on a clean Smock , and to Church , and Marry , And then to Bed a Gods name , this is fair play , And keeps the Kings peace , let her leave her bobs , I have had too many of them , and her quillets , She is as nimble that way as an Ee [ le ] ; But in the way she ought to me especially , A sow of Lead is swifter .
Quoat your griefs down .
Give fair quarter , I am old and crasie , And subject to much fumbling , I confess it ; Yet something I would have that 's warme , to hatch me : But understand me I would have it so , I buy not more repentance in the bargainThan the ware 's worth I have ; if you allow meWorthy your Son-in-Law , and your allowance , Do it a way of credit ; let me show so , And not be troubled in my visitations , With blows , and bitterness , and down-right railings , As if we were to couple like two Cats , With clawing , and loud clamour:
Thou fond Man.Hast thou forgot the Ballad , crabbed age , Can May and January match together , And nev'r a storm between 'em ? say she abuse thee , Put case she doe .
Well .
Nay , believe she do 's .
I do believe she do 's .
And div'lishly : Art thou a whit the worse ?
That 's not the matter , I know , being old , tis fit I am abus 'd ; I know 't is hansome , and I know moreoverI am to love her for't .
Now you come to me .
Nay more than this ; I find too , and find certain , What Gold I have , Pearle , Bracelets , Rings , or Owches , Or what she can desire , Gowns , Petticotes , Wastcotes , Embroydered-stockings , Scarffs , Cals , Feathers , Hats , five pound Garters , Muffs , Masks , Ruffs , and Ribands , I am to give her for't .
'T is right , you are so .
But when I have done all this , and think it duty , Is't requisit an other bore my nostrils ? Riddle me that .
Go get you gone , and dreameShe 's thine within these two dayes , for she is so ; The Boy 's beside the saddle : get warm broths , And feed a pace ; think not of worldly business , It cools the blood ; leave off your tricks , they are hateful , And meere fore-runners of the ancient measures ; Contrive your beard o'th top cut like Verdugoes ; It shows you would be wise , and burn your night-cap , It looks like half a winding-sheet , and urgesFrom a young Wench nothing but cold repentance : You may eate Onyons , so you'l not be lavish .
I am glad of that .
They purge the blood , and quicken , But after 'em , conceive me , sweep your mouth , And where there wants a tooth , stick in a clove .

But that I was not i n't , there 's my sorrow , thereNow you understand me , for I 'll tell you , It was so sound a piece , and so well carried , And if you mark the way , so hansomely , Of such a heighth , and excellence , and artI have not known a braver ; for conceive me , When the gross fool her Husband would be sick --

Not come to comfort him ? she that all LawsOf heaven , and Nations have ordain 'd his second , Is she refus 'd ? and two old Paradoxes , Pieces of five and fifty , without faithClapt in upon him ? h'as a little pet , That all young Wives must follow necessary , Having their Maiden-heads --

Though I do know this falser than the Devil , I can not choose but love it .
What do I knowBut those that came to keep him , might have kill 'd him , In what a case had I been then ?

I am gone. [ Ex. Tra .
Livia .
Ho Livia .
Who 's that ?
A friend of yours , Lord how you look now , As if you had lost a Carrack .
O Byancha.I am the most undone , unhappy Woman .
Be quiet Wench , thou shalt be done , and done , And done , and double done , or all shall split for't , No more of these minc 'd passions , they are mangy , And ease thee of nothing , but a little Wind , An Apple will do more : thou fear'st Moroso .
Even as I fear the Gallowes .
Keep thee there still.And you love Rowland ? say .
If I say not , I am sure I lye .
What wouldst thou give that Woman , In spight of all his anger , and thy fear , And all thy Fathers policy , that couldClap ye within these two nights quietlyInto a Bed together ?
How ?
Why fairly , At half sword man and wife : now the red blood comes , I marry now the matters chang 'd .
Byancha , Methinks you should not mock me .
Mock a pudding.I speak good honest English , and good meaning .
I should not be ungrateful to that Woman .
I know thou would'st not , follow but my Councel , And if thou hast him not , despite of fortuneLet me nev'r know a good night more ; you mustBe very sick o'th instant .
Well , what follows ?
And in that sickness send for all your friends , Your Father , and your feaver old Moroso , And Rowland shall be there too .
What of these ?
Do you not twitter yet ? of this shall followThat which shall make thy heart leap , and thy lipsVenture as many kisses , as the MerchantsDoe Dollars to the East-Indies : you shall know all , But first walke in , and practise , pray be sick .
I do believe you : and I am sick .
Doe , To bed then , come , I 'll send away your ServantsPost for your Fool , and Father ; and good fortune , As we meane honesty , now strike an up-shot. [ Ex [ e ] unt .
Tranio , and Rowland .
Nay , on my conscience , I have lost my Money , But that 's all one : I 'll never more perswade you , I see you are resolute , and I commend you .
But did she send for me ?
You dare believe me .
I can not tell , you have your wayes for profitAllow 'd you Tranio , as well as IHave to avoid 'em [ feare ] .
No , on my word , Sir , I deale directly with you .
How now fellow , Whither Post you so fast ?
O sir my Master , Pray did you see my Master ?
Why your Master ?
Sir his Jewel .
With the gilded Button ?
My pretty Mistress Livia .
What of her ?
Is falen sick o'th suddain .
How o'th sullens ?
O'th suddain Sir , I say , very sick:
It seems she hath got the toothach with raw Apples .
It seemes you have got the headach , fare you well Sir.You did not see my Master ?
Who told you so ?
No , no , he did not see him .
Farewell Blew-bottle. [ Ex. Servant.What should her sickness be ?
For you it may be .
Yes , when my braines are out , I may believe it , Never before I am sure : Yet I may see her ; 'Twill be a point of honesty:
It will so .
It may be not too : you would fain be fing'ringThis old sin-offring of two hundred , Tranio , How daintily , and cunningly you drive meUp like a Deer to'th toyle , yet I may leap it , And what 's the Woodman then ?
A loser by you.Speak , Will you go or not ? to me 't is equal .
Come , What goes less ?
Nay , not a penny Rowland .
Shall I have liberty of conscience , Which , by interpretation , is ten kisses ? Hang me if I affect : her : yet it may be , This whorson manners will require a strugling , Of two and twenty , or by'r-Lady thirty .
By'r-Lady I 'll require my wager then , For if you kiss so often , and no kindness , I have lost my speculation , I 'll allow you --
Speak like a Gamster now .
It may be two .
Under a dozen Tranio , there 's no setting , You shall have forty shillings , winck at small faults.Say I take twenty , come , by all that 's honestI do it but to vex her .
I 'll no by-blowes.If you can love her , doe , if you can , hate her , Or any else that loves you --
Prethee Tranio .
Why farewell twenty pound , 'twill not undoe me ; You have my resolution .
And your Money , Which since you are so stubborn , if I forfeit , Make me a Jack o ' Lent , and break my shinsFor untag 'd Points and Compters : I 'll goe with you , But if thou gett'st a penny by the bargain ; A parting kiss is lawful ?
I allow it .
Knock out my brains with Apples ; yet a bargain:
I tell you , I 'll no bargains ; win , and wear it .
Thou art the strangest fellow .
That 's all one .
Along then , twenty pound more if thou dar'st , I give her not a good word .
Not a Penny. [ Exeunt .
Petruchio , Jaques , and Pedro .
Prethee , entreat her come , I will not trouble herAbove a word or two ; ere I endure [ Exit Pedro.This life and with a Woman , and a vow 'd oneTo all the mischiefs she can lay upon me , I 'll go to Plough [ again ] , and eate Leeke Porridge ; Begging 's a pleasure to't , not to be number 'd : No there be other Countries Jaques for me and other people , yea , and other women.If I have need here 's Money , there 's your ware , Which is faire dealing , and the Sun , they say , Shines as warme there , as here , and till I have lostEither my self , or her , I care not whetherNor which first .
Will your worship hear me ?
And utterly outworne the memoryOf such a curse as this , none of my NationShall ever know me more .
Out alas Sir.What a strange way doe you run !
Any way , So I out-run this Rascal .
Me thinks now , If your good worship could but have the patience .
The patience , why the patience ?
Why I 'll tell you , Could you but have the patience .
Well the patience .
To laugh at all she do 's , or when she railes , To have a Drum beaten o'th top o'th house , To give the neighbors warning of her Larme , As I do when my Wife rebels .
Thy Wife ? Thy Wife 's a Pigeon to her , a meere slumber , The dead of night 's not stiller .
Nor an Iron Mill .
But thy Wife is certain .
That 's false Doctrine , You never read of a certain Woman .
Thou know'st her way .
I should doe , I am sure.I have ridden it night , and day , this twenty year .
But mine is such a drench of Balderdash , Such a strange carded cunningness , the Rayne-bowWhen she hangs bent in Heaven , sheds not her coloursQuicker , and more , than this deceitful Woman
Ped.Weaves in her dye 's of wickedness : what sayes she ?
Nay not a word sir , but she pointed to me , As though she meant to follow ; pray sir bear itEv'n as you may , I need not teach your worship , The best men have their crosses , we are all mortal .
What ailes the fellow ?
And no doubt she may Sir .
What may she , or what do 's she , or what is she ? Speak and be hang 'd .
She 's mad Sir .
Heaven continue it .
Amen if't be his pleasure .
How mad is she ?
As mad as heart can wish Sir : she has drest her self ( Saving your worships reverence ) just i'th ' cutOf one of those that multiply i'th SuburbsFor single Money , and as durtily : If any speak to her , first she whistles , And then begins her compass with her fingers , And points to what she would have .
What new way 's this ?
There came in Master Sophocles .
And whatDid Master Sophocles when he came in ? Get my Truncks ready , sirha , I 'll be gone straight .
He 's here to tell youShe 's horne mad Jaques .
Sophocles .
Call ye this a Woman ?
Yes sir , she is a Woman .
Sir , I doubt it .
I had thought you had made experience .
Yes , I did so.And almost with my life .
You rid too fast , Sir .
Pray be not mistaken : by this handYour wife 's as chaste , and honest as a Virgin , For any thing I know : 't is true she gave meA Ring .
For rutting .
You are much deceiv 'd still , Believe me , I never kist her since , and nowComing in visitation , like a friend , I think she is mad , Sir , suddainly she started , And snatch 'd the Ring away , and drew her knife out , To what intent I know not .
Is this certain ?
As I am here , Sir .
I believe you honest.And pray continue so .
Maria .
She comes .
Now Damsel , What will your beauty do if I forsake you ? Do you deal by signs , and tokens ? as I ghess then , You 'll walk abroad , this Summer , and catch Captains , Or hire a piece of holy ground i ' th ' Suburbs , And keep a Nest of Nuns ?
Oh do not stir her ! You see in what a case she is ?
She is dogged , And in a beastly case I am sure : I 'll make her , If she have any tongue , yet tattle. Sophocles , Prethee observe this woman seriously , And eye her well , and when thou hast done , but tell me ( For thou hast understanding ) in what caseMy sense was , when I chose this thing .
I 'll tell youI have seen a sweeter --
An hundred times cry Oisters.There 's a poor Begger-wench about Black-FryersRuns on her breech , may be an Empress to her .
Nay , now you are too bitter .
Nev'r a whit Sir : I 'll tell thee woman ; for now I have day to see thee , And all my wits about me , and I speakNot out of passion neither ( leave your mumping ) I know you 're well enough : Now would I giveA million but to vex her : when I chose theeTo make a Bedfellow , I took more trouble , Than twenty Terms can come to , such a cause , Of such a title , and so everlastingThat Adams Genealogie may be endedE'r any Law find thee : I took a Leprosie , Nay worse , the plague , nay worse yet , a possessionAnd had the devil with thee , if not more : And yet worse , was a beast , and like a beastHad my reward , a Jade to fling my fortunes ; For who that had but reason to distinguishThe light from darkness , wine from water , hungerFrom full satiety , and Fox from Fern-bushThat would have married thee ?
She is not so ill .
She 's worse than I dare think of : she 's so lewd ; No Court is strong enough to bear her cause , She hath neither manners , honesty , behaviour , Wife-hood , nor woman-hood , nor any mortalCan force me think she had a mother : noI do believe her stedfastly , and know herTo be a Woman-wolfe by transmigration , Her first forme was a Ferrets under-ground , She kils the memories of men : not yet ?
Do you think she 's sensible of this ?
I care not , Be what she will : the pleasure I take in her , Thus I blow off ; the care I took to love her , Like this point , I untie , and thus I loose it ; The husband I am to her , thus I sever ; My vanity farewel : yet , for you have beenSo near me , as to bear the name of wife , My unquench 'd charity shall tell you thus much , ( Though you deserve it well ) you shall not beg , What I ordain 'd your Joynture , honestlyYou shall have setled on you : and half my house , The other half shall be imploy 'd in prayers , ( That meritorious charge I 'll be at alsoYet to confirm you Christian ) your apparel , And what belongs to build up such a folly , Keep I beseech you , it infects our uses , And now I am for travel .
Now I love you , And now I see you are a man , I 'll talke to you , And I forget your bitterness .
How now man ?
Oh Pliny , if thou wilt be ever famousMake but this woman all thy wonders .
Sure SirYou have hit upon a happy course , a blessed , And what will make you virtuous ?
She 'll ship me .
A way of understanding I long wish 'd for , And now 't is come , take heed you fly not back Sir , Methinks you look a new man to me now , A man of excellence , and now I seeSome great design set in you : you may think now ( And so may most that know me ) 'twere my partWeakly to weep your loss , and to resist you , Nay , hang about your neck , and like a dotardUrge my strong tie upon you : but I love you , And all the world shall know it , beyond woman ; And more prefer the honor of your Countrey , Which chiefly you are born for , and may perfect , The uses you may make of other Nations , The ripening of your knowledge , conversation , The full ability , and strength of judgement.Than any private love , or wanton kisses.Go worthy man , and bring home understanding .
This were an excellent woman to breed School-men .
For if the Merchant through unknown Seas ploughTo get his wealth , then dear Sir , what must youTo gather wisdom ? go , and go alone , Only your noble mind for your companion , And if a woman may win credit with you , Go far , too far you can not : still the fartherThe more experience finds you : and go sparing , One meal a week will serve you , and one sute , Through all your travels : for you 'll find it certain , The poorer and the baser you appear , The more you look through still .
Dost hear her ?
Yes .
What would this woman do if she were suffer 'd , Upon a new Religion ?
Make us Pagans , I wonder that she writes not .
Then when time , And fulness of occasion have new made you , And squar 'd you from a Sot into a Signior , Or nearer , from a Jade into a Courser ; Come home an aged man , as did Ulysses , And I your glad Penelope .
That must haveAs many Lovers as I Languages.And what she does with one i'th ' day , i'th ' nightUndoe it with another .
Much that way , Sir ; For in your absence it must be my honor , That , that must make me spoken of hereafter , To have temptations , and not little onesDaily and hourly offered me , and strongly , Almost believed against me , to set offThe faith , and loyalty of her that loves you .
What should I do ?
Why by my -- -- I would travel , Did not you mean so ?
Alas no , nothing less man : I did it but to try , Sir , she 's the Devil , And now I find it , for she drives me ; I must go : Are my trunks down there , and my horses ready ?
Sir , for your house , and if you please to trust meWith that you leave behind .
Bring down the money .
As I am able , and to my poor fortunes , I 'll govern as a widow : I shall longTo hear of your well-doing , and your profit : And when I hear not from you once a quarter , I 'll wish you in the Indies , or Cata [ ya ] , Those are the climes must make you .
How 's the wind ? She 'll wish me out o'th ' world anon .
For France.'Tis very fair ; get you aboard to night , Sir , And loose no time , you know the tide staies no man , I have cold meats ready for you .
Fare thee well , Thou hast fool 'd me out o ' th ' Kingdom with a vengeance , And thou canst fool me in again .
Not I Sir , I love you better , take your time , and pleasure.I 'll see you hors 'd .
I think thou wouldst see me hanged too , Were I but half as willing .
Any thingThat you think well of , I dare look upon .
You 'll bear me to the Lands end , Sophocles , And other of my friends I hope .
Nev'r doubt , Sir , You can not want companions for your good : I am sure you 'll kiss me e'r I go ; I have business , And stay long here I must not .
Get thee going.For if thou tarriest but another DialogueI 'll kick thee to thy Chamber .
Fare you well , Sir , And bear your self , I do beseech you , once more , Since you have undertaken doing wisely , Manly , and worthily , 't is for my credit , And for those flying fames here of your follies , Your gambols , and ill breeding of your youth , For which I understand you take this travel , Nothing should make me leave you else , I 'll dealSo like a wife that loves your reputation , And the most large addition of your credit , That those shall die : if you want Limon-waters , Or any thing to take the edge o ' th ' Sea off , Pray speak , and be provided .
Now the Devil , That was your first good Master , showre his blessingUpon ye all : Into whose custody --
I do commit your Reformation , And so I leave you to your Stilo novo. [ Exit Maria .
I will go : yet I will not : once more SophoclesI 'll put her to the test .
You had better go .
I will go then : let 's seek my Father out , And all my friends , to see me fair aboard : Then women , if there be a storm at Sea , Worse than your tongues can make , and waves more broken , Than your dissembling faiths are , let me feelNothing but tempests , till they crack my Keel. [ Exeunt .
Petronius , and Byancha , with four papers .
Now whether I deserve that blame you gave me , Let all the world discern , Sir .
If this motion , ( I mean this fair repentance of my Daughter ) Spring from your good perswasion , as it seems so , I must confess I have spoke too boldly of you , And I repent .
The first touch was her own , Taken no doubt from disobeying you , The second I put to her , when I told herHow good , and gentle yet , with free contritionAgain you might be purchas 'd : loving woman , She heard me , and I thank her , thought me worthyObserving in this point : yet all my counsel , And comfort in this case , could not so heal herBut that grief got his share too , and she sick'ned .
I am sorry she 's so ill , yet glad her sicknessHas got so good a ground .
Moroso .
Here comes Moroso .
Oh , you are very welcome , Now you shall know your happiness .
I am glad on't.What makes this Lady here ?
A dish for you , SirYou 'll thank me for hereafter .
True Moroso , Go get you in , and see your Mistriss .
She is sick , Sir , But you may kiss her whole .
How .
Comfort her .
Why am I sent for , Sir ?
Will you in , and see ?
May be she needs confession .
By St. Mary , She shall have absolution then , and pennance , But not above her carriage .
Get you in fool. [ Exit Mor .
Here comes the other too .
Rowland and Tranio .
Now Tranio.Good ev'n to you too , and you are welcome .
Thank you .
I have a certain Daughter .
Would you had , Sir .
No doubt you know her well .
Nor never shall , Sir.She is a woman , and the waies unto herAre like the finding of a certain pathAfter a deep fall'n Snow .
Well , that 's by th ' by still.This Daughter that I tell you of , is fall'nA little crop sick , with the dangerous surfeitShe took of your affection .
Mine Sir ?
Yes Sir.Or rather , as it seems , repenting.And there she lies within , debating o n't .
Well Sir .
I think 'twere well you would see her .
If you please , Sir ; I am not squeamish of my visitation .
But , this I 'll tell you , she is alter 'd much , You 'll find her now another Livia .
I have enough o ' th ' old , Sir .
No more fool , To look gay babies in your eyes young Rowland , And hang about your pretty neck .
I am glad o n't , And thank my Fates I have scap 'd such execution .
And buss you till you blush again .
That 's hard , Sir ; She must kiss shamefully e 're I blush at it , I never was so boyish ; well , what follows ?
She 's mine now , as I please to settle herAt my command , and where I please to plant her : Only she would take a kind of farewel of you , And give you back a wandring vow or two , You left in pawn ; and two or three slight oathsShe lent you too , she looks for .
She shall have 'emWith all my heart , Sir , and if you like it better , A free release in writing .
That 's the matter , And you from her , [ you ] shall have another Rowland , And then turn tail to tail , and peace be with you .
So be it : Your twenty pound sweats Tranio .
'Twill not undoe me Rowland , do your worst .
Come , shall we see her , Sir ?
What e'er she saiesYou must bear manly Rowland , for her sicknessHas made her somewhat [ teatish . ]
Let her talkTill her tongue ake , I care not : by this handThou hast a handsome face wench , and a bodyDaintily mounted ; now do I feel an hundredRunning directly from me , as I pist it .
Livia discovered abed , and Moroso by her .
Pray draw 'em softly , the least hurry , Sir , Puts her to much impatience .
How is't daughter ?
Oh very sick , very sick , yet somewhatBetter I hope ; a little lightsomer , Because this good man has forgiven me ; Pray set me higher ; oh my head:
Well done wench .
And I unask 'd , forgive it .
Where 's Byancha ?
Here Cosin .
Give me drink .
There .
Who 's that ?
Rowland .
Oh my dissembler , you and I must part.Come nearer , Sir .
I am sorry for your sickness .
Be sorry for your self , Sir , you have wrong 'd me , But I forgive you ; are the Papers ready ?
I have 'em here : wilt please you view 'em ?
Yes .
Shew 'em the young man too , I know he 's willingTo shift his sails too : 't is for his more advancement ; Alas , we might have begger 'd one another ; We are young both , and a world of childrenMight have been left behind to curse our follies : We had been undone Byancha , had we married , Undone for ever , I confess I lov 'd him , I care not who shall know it , most intirely ; And once , upon my conscience , he lov 'd me ; But farewel that , we must be wiser , cosin , Love must not leave us to the world : have you done ?
Yes , and am ready to subscribe .
Pray stay then : Give me the papers , and let me peruse 'em , And so much time , as may afford a tearAt our last parting .
Pray retire , and leave her , I 'll call ye presently .
Come Gentlemen , the showre must fall .
Would I had never seen her. [ Exeunt .
Thou hast done bravely wench .
Pray Heaven it prove so .
There are the other papers : when they comeBegin you first , and let the rest subscribeHard by your side ; give 'em as little lightAs Drapers do their Wares .
Didst mark Moroso , In what an agony he was , and how he cry 'd mostWhen I abus 'd him most ?
That was but reason .
Oh what a stinking thief is this ? Though I was but to counterfeit , he made meDirectly sick indeed. Thames-street to himIs a meer Pomander .
Let him be hang 'd .
Amen .
And lie you still ; And once more to your business .
Call 'em in.Now if there be a power that pities Lovers , Help now , and hear my prayers .
Petronius , Rowland , Tranio , Moroso .
Is she ready ?
She has done her lamentations : pray go to her .
Rowland , come near me , and before you seal , Give me your hand : take it again ; now kiss me.This is the last acquaintance we must have ; I wish you ever happy : there 's the paper .
Pray stay a little .
Let me never live moreBut I do begin to pity this young fellow ; How heartily he weeps !
There 's Pen and Ink , Sir .
Ev'n here I pray you. 'T is a little EmblemHow near you have been to me .
There .
Your hands too , As witnesses .
By any meansTo th ' Book son .
With all my heart .
You must deliver it .
There Livia , and a better love light on thee , I can no more .
To this you must be witness too .
We will .
Do you deliver it now .
Pray set me up ; There Rowland , all thy old love back : and mayA new to come exceed mine , and be happy.I must no more .
Farewel:
A long farewel. [ Exit Row .
Leave her by any means , till this wild passionBe off her head : draw all the Curtains close , A day hence you may see her , 'twill be better , She is now for little company .
Pray tend her.I must to horse straight , you must needs along too , To see my son aboard : were but his wifeAs fit for pity , as this wench , I were happy .
Time must do that too : fare ye well : to morrowYou shall receive a wife to quit your sorrow. [ Exeunt .
Jaques , Pedro , and Porters , with Chest and Hampers .
Bring 'em away Sirs .
Must the great Trunks go too ?
Yes , and the Hampers ; nay , be speedy Masters ; He 'll be at Sea before us else .
Oh Jaques , What a most blessed turn hast thou !
I hope so .
To have the Sea between thee and this woman , Nothing can drown her tongue but a storm .
By your leave , We 'll get us up to Paris with all speed ; For on my soul , as far as AmiensShe 'll carry blank , away to Lyon-keyAnd ship 'em presently , we 'll follow ye .
Now could I wish her in that Trunk:
God shield man , I had rather have a Bear i n't .
Yes , I 'll tell ye : For in the passage , if a Tempest take ye , As many doe , and you lie beating for it , Then , if it pleas 'd the fates , I would have the Master , Out of a powerful providence , to cry , Lighten the ship of all hands , or we perish ; Then this for one , as best spar 'd , should by all means , Over-board presently .
O ' that condition , So we were certain to be rid of her , I would wish her with us , but believe me Pedro , She would spoil the fishing on this coast for ever.For none would keep her company but Dog-fish , As currish as her self ; or Porpisces , Made to all fatal uses : The two Fish-streetsWere she but once arriv 'd amongst the Whitings , Would sing a woful misereri Pedro , And mourn in Poor John , till her memoryWere cast o ' shore agen , with a strong Sea-breach : She would make god Neptune , and his Fire-fork , And all his demi-gods , and goddesses , As weary of the Flemmish Channel , Pedro , As ever boy was of the School , 't is certain , If she but meet him fair , and were well angred , She would break his god-head .
Oh her tongue , her tongue .
Rather her many tongues .
Or rather strange tongues .
Her lying tongue .
Her lisping tongue .
Her long tongue .
Her lawless tongue .
Her loud tongue .
And her liquorish --
Many other tongues , and many stranger tonguesThan ever Babel had to tell his ruines , Were Women rais 'd withal ; but never a true one .
Sophocles .
Home with your stuff agen , the journey 's ended .
What does your worship mean ?
Your Master , Oh Petruchio , oh poor fellows .
Oh Jaques , Jaques .
Oh your Master 's dead , His body coming back , his wife , his devil ; The grief of -- -- her .
Has kill 'd him ?
Kill 'd him , kill 'd him .
Is there no Law to hang her .
Get ye in , And let her know her misery , I dare notFor fear impatience seize me , see her more , I must away agen : Bid her for wife-hood , For honesty , if she have any in her , Even to avoid the shame that follows her.Cry if she can , your weeping can not mend it.The body will be here within this hour , so tell her ; And all his friends to curse her. Farewel fellows. [ Exit Soph .
Oh Jaques , Jaques .
Oh my worthy Master .
Oh my most beastly Mistriss , hang her .
Split her .
Drown her directly .
Starve her .
Stink upon her .
Stone her to death : may all she eat be Eggs.Till she run kicking mad for men .
And he , That man , that gives her remedy , pray Heav'nHe may ev'n ipso facto , lose his [ longings . ]
Let 's go discharge our selves , and he that serves her , Or speaks a good word of her from this hour , A Sedgly curse light on him , which is , Pedro ; The Fiend ride through him booted , and spurr 'd , with a Sythe at'sback. [ Exeunt .
Rowland , and Tranio stealing behind him .
What a dull ass was I to let her go thus ! Upon my life she loves me still : well Paper , Thou only monument of what I have had , Thou all the love now left me , and now lost , Let me yet kiss her hand , yet take my leaveOf what I must leave ever : Farewel Livia.Oh bitter words , I 'll read ye once again , And then for ever study to forget ye.How 's this ? let me look better o n't : A Contract ? -- A Contract , seal 'd , and ratified , Her Fathers hand set to it , and Moroso 's : I do not dream sure , let me read again , The same still , 't is a Contract .
'T is so Rowland ; And by the virtue of the same , you pay meAn hundred pound to morrow .
Art sure Tranio , We are both alive now ?
Wonder not , ye have lost .
If this be true , I grant it .
'T is most certain , There 's a Ring for you too , you know it .
Yes .
When shall I have my money ?
Stay ye , stay ye , When shall I marry her ?
To night .
Take heed nowYou do not trifle me ; if you do , You 'll find more payment , than your money comes to : Come swear ; I know I am a man , and findI may deceive my self : swear faithfully , Swear me directly , am I Rowland ?
Yes .
Am I awake ?
Ye are .
Am I in health ?
As far as I conceive .
Was I with Livia ?
You were , and had this Contract .
And shall I enjoy her ?
Yes , if ye dare .
Swear to all these .
I will .
As thou art honest , as them hast a conscience , As that may wring thee if thou liest ; all theseTo be no vision , but a truth , and serious .
Then by my honesty , and faith , and conscience ; All this is certain .
Let 's remove our places.Swear it again .
By -- -- 't is true .
I have lost then , and Heaven knows I am glad on't.Let 's goe , and tell me all , and tell me how , For yet I am a Pagan in it .
I have a Priest too , And all shall come as even as two Testers. [ Exeunt .
Petronius , Sophocles , Moroso , and Petruchio bornin a Coffin .
Set down the body , and one call her out .
Maria in black , and Jaques.You are welcome to the last cast of your fortunes ; There lies your Husband ; there , your loving Husband , There he that was Petruchio , too good for ye ; Your stubborn and unworthy way has kill 'd himE'er he could reach the Sea ; if ye can weep , Now ye have cause begin , and after deathDoe something yet to th ' world , to think ye honest.So many tears had say 'd him , shed in time ; And as they are ( so a good mind go with 'em ) Yet they may move compassion .
Pray ye all hear me , And judge me as I am , not as you covet , For that would make me yet more miserable : 'T is true , I have cause to grieve , and mighty cause ; And truly and unfeinedly I weep it .
I see there 's some good nature yet left in her .
But what 's the cause ? mistake me not , not this man , As he is dead , I weep for ; Heaven defend it , I never was so childish : but his life , His poor unmanly , wretched , foolish life , Is that my full eyes pity , there 's my mourning .
Dost thou not shame ?
I doe , and even to water , To think what this man was , to think how simple , How far below a man , how far from reason , From common understanding , and all Gentry , While he was living here he walk 'd amongst us.He had a happy turn he dyed ; I 'll tell ye , These are the wants I weep for , not his person : The memory of this man , had he liv'dBut two years longer , had begot more follies , Than wealthy Autumn Flies. But let him rest , He was a fool , and farewel he ; not pitied , I mean in way of life , or actionBy any understanding man that 's honest ; But only in 's posterity , which I , Out of the fear his ruines might out-live him , In some bad issue , like a careful woman , Like one indeed , born only to preserve him , Deny 'd him means to raise .
Unbutton me , -- I die indeed else ! Oh Maria , Oh my unhappiness , my misery .
Goe to him whore ; -- -- if he perish , I 'll see thee hang 'd my self .
Why , why Maria ?
I have done my worst , and have my end , forgive me ; From this hour make me what you please : I have tam 'd ye , And now am vow 'd your servant : Look not strangely , Nor fear what I say to you. Dare you kiss me ? Thus I begin my new love .
Once again ?
With all my heart .
Once again Maria , Oh Gentlemen , I know not where I am .
Get ye to bed then : there you 'll quickly know Sir .
Never no more your old tricks ?
Never Sir .
You shall not need , for as I have a faithNo cause shall give occasion .
As I am honest , And as I am a maid yet , all my lifeFrom this hour , since ye make so free profession , I dedicate in service to your pleasure .
I marry , this goes roundly off .
Goe Jaques , Get all the best meat may be bought for money , And let the hogsheads blood , I am born again : Well little England , when I see a HusbandOf any other Nation , stern or jealous , I 'll wish him but a woman of thy breeding ; And if he have not butter to his bread , Till his teeth bleed , I 'll never trust my travel .
Rowland , Livia , Byancha , and Tranio .
What have we here ?
Another Morris , Sir.That you must pipe too .
A poor married coupleDesire an offering , Sir .
Never frown at it , You can not mend it now : there 's your own hand ; And yours Moroso , to confirm the bargain .
My hand ?
Or mine ?
You 'll find it so .
A trick , By -- -- a trick .
Yes Sir , we trickt ye .
Father .
Hast thou lain with him ? speak !
Yes truly Sir .
And hast thou done the deed , boy ?
I have [ done ] , Sir , That , that will serve the turn , I think .
A match then , I 'll be the maker up of this : Moroso , There 's now no remedy you see , be willing ; [ F ] or be , or be not , he must have the wench .
Since I am over-reach 'd , let 's in to dinner , And if I can , I 'll drink't away .
That 's well said .
Well sirrah , you have plaid a trick , look to't , And let me be a Grandsire within 's twelve-month , Or by this hand , I 'll curtail half your fortunes .
There shall not want my labour , Sir : your money ; Here 's one has undertaken .
Well , I 'll trust her , And glad I have so good a pawn .
I 'll watch ye .
Let 's in , and drink of all hands , and be jovial : I have my Colt again , and now she carries ; And Gentlemen , whoever marries next , Let him be sure he keep him to his Text. [ Exeunt.EPILOGUE .

Pymero , Christophero , and Pedro .
Open the Ports , and see the Watch reliev 'd , And let the guards be careful of their business , Their vigilant eyes fixt on these Islanders , They are false and desperate people , when they findThe least occasion open to encouragement , Cruel , and crafty souls , believe me Gentlemen , Their late attempt , which is too fresh amongst us , In which , against all arms and honesty , The Governor of Ternata made surprizeOf our Confederate , the King of Tidore , As for his recreation he was rowingBetween both Lands , bids us be wise and circumspect .
It was a mischief suddenly imagin 'd , And as soon done ; that Governor 's a fierce knave , Unfaithful as he is fierce too , there 's no trusting ; But I wonder much , how such poor and base pleasures , As tugging at an Oar , or skill in Steerage , Should become Princes .
Base breedings , love base pleasure ; They take as much delight in a Baratto , A little scurvy boat to row her ti [ th ] ly , And have the Art to turn and wind her nimbly , Think it as noble too , though it be slavish , And a dull labour that declines a Gentleman : As we Portugals , or the Spaniards do in riding , In managing a great horse , which is princely : The French in Courtship , or the dancing English , In carrying a fair presence .
He was strangely taken ; But where no faith is , there 's no trust : he has paid for'tHis Sister yet the fair and great Quisara , Has shew 'd a noble mind , and much love in'tTo her afflicted brother , and the nobler still it appears , And seasons of more tenderness , because his ruin stiles her absoluteAnd his imprisonment adds to her profit.Feeling all this , which makes all men admire her , The warm beams of this fortune that fall on her , Yet has she made divers and noble Treaties , And propositions for her brothers freedom , If wealth or honor --
Peace , peace , you are fool 'd , Sir ; Things of these natures have strange outsides Pedro , And cunning shadows , set 'em far from us , Draw 'em but near , they are gross , and they abuse us ; They that observe her close , shall find her nature , Which I doubt mainly will not prove so excellent ; She is a Princess , and she must be fair , That 's the prerogative of being Royal : Let her want eyes and nose , she must be beauteous , And she must know it too , and the use of it , And people must believe it , they are damn 'd else : Why , all our neighbor Princes are mad for her .
Is she not fair then ?
But her hopes are fairer , And there 's a haughty Master , the King of Bakan , That lofty Sir , that speaks far more , and louderIn his own commendations , than a Cannon : He is strucken dumb with her .
Beshrew me she is a sweet one .
And there 's that hopeful man of Syana , That sprightly fellow , he that 's wise and temperate , He is a Lover too .
Wou 'd I were worth her lookingFor ; by my life I hold her a compleat one , The very Sun , I think affects her sweetness , And dares not , as he does to all else , dye itInto his tauny Livery .
She dares not see him , But keeps her self at distance from his kisses , And [ weares ] her complexion in a Case ; let him but like itA week , or two , or three , she would look like a Lion ; But the main sport o n't is , or rather wonderThe Governor of Ternata , her mortal enemy , He that has catcht her brother King , is struck too , And is arriv 'd under safe conduct also , And hostages of worth delivered for him ; And he brought a Letter from his prisoner , Whether compell 'd , or willingly deliveredFrom the poor King , or what else dare be i n't .
So it be honourable , any thing , 't is all oneFor I dare think she 'll do the best .
'T is certainHe has admittance , and sollicites hourly , Now if he have the trick --
What trick ?
The true one , To take her too , if he be but skill 'd in Bat-fowling , And lime his bush right .
I 'll be hang 'd when that hits , For 't is not a compell 'd , or forc 'd affectionThat must take her , I guess her stout and virtuous , But where 's your Uncle , Sir , our valiant Captain , The brave Ruy Dias all this while ?
I marry.He is amongst 'em too .
A Lover .
Nay , I know not that , but [ sure ] he stands in favour , Or would stand stifly , he is no Portugal else .
The voice says in good favour , in the list tooOf the privy wooers , how cunningly of lateI have observ 'd him , and how privatelyHe has stolen at all hours from us , and how readilyHe has feign 'd a business to bid the Fort farewelFor five or six days , or a month together , Sure there is something --
Yes , yes , there is a thing i n't , A thing would make the best on 's all dance after it ; A dainty thing ; Lord how this Uncle of mineHas read to me , and rated me for wenching.And told me in what desperate case 'twould leave me , And how 'twould stew my bones .
You car 'd not for it .
I'faith not much , I ventur 'd on still easily , And took my chance , danger is a Soldiers honor ; But that this man , this herb of Grace , Ruy Dias , This father of our faculties should slip thus , For sure he is a ferriting , that heThat would drink nothing , to depress the spirit , But milk and water , eat nothing but thin airTo make his bloud obedient , that his youth , In spight of all his temperance , should tickle , And have a love mange on him .
'T is in him , Sir , But honourable courtship , and becomes his rank too .
In me 'twere abominable Leachery , or would be , For when our thoughts are o n't , and miss their level , We must hit something .
Well , he 's a noble Gentleman , And if he be a suitor , may he speed i n't .
Let him alone , our family ne'r fail 'd yet .
Our mad Lieutenant still , merry Pyniero , Thus wou 'd he do , if the Surgeon were searching of him .
Especially if a warm wench had shot him .
But hark Christophero ; come hither Pedro ; When saw you our brave Countrey-man Armusia ? He that 's arriv 'd here lately , and his gallants ? A goodly fellow , and a brave companionMethinks he is , and no doubt , truly valiant , For he that dares come hither , dares fight any where .
I saw him not of late , a sober GentlemanI am sure he is , and no doubt bravely sprung , And promises much nobleness .
I love him , And by my troth wou 'd fain be inward with him ; Pray let 's go seek him .
We 'll attend you Sir .
By that time we shall hear the burst of business. [ Exeunt .
Ruy Dias , Quisara , Quisana ; and Panura .
Aunt , I much thank you for your courtesie , And the fair liberty you still allow me , Both of your house and service , though I beA Princess , and by that Prerogative stand freeFrom the poor malice of opinion , And no ways bound to render up my actions , Because no power above me can examine me ; Yet my dear brother being still a prisoner , And many wandring eyes upon my ways , Being left alone a Sea-mark , it behoves meTo use a little caution , and be circumspect .
You 're wise and noble Lady .
Often AuntI resort hither , and privately to see you , It may be to converse with some I favour ; I wou 'd not have it known as oft , nor constru 'd , It stands not with my care .
You speak most fairly , For even our pure devotions are examin 'd .
So mad are mens minds now .
Or rather monstrous ; They are thick dreams , bred in fogs that know no fairness .
Madam , the House is yours , I am yours , pray use me , And at your service all I have lies prostrate ; My care shall ever be to yield ye honor , And when your fame falls here , 't is my fault Lady ; A poor and simple banquet I have provided , Which if you please to honor with your presence --
I thank ye Aunt , I shall be with you instantly , A few words with this Gentleman .
I 'll leave ye , And when you please retire , I 'll wait upon you. [ Exeunt Quis. & Pan .
Why , how now Captain , what afraid to speak to me ? A man of Armes , and danted with a Lady ? Commanders have the power to parle with Princes .
Madam , the favors you have still showr 'd on me , Which are so high above my means of merit , So infinite , that nought can value 'emBut their own goodness , no eyes look up to 'emBut those that are of equal light , and lustre , Strike me thus mute , you are my royal Mistriss , And all my services that aime at honor , Take life from you , the Saint of my devotions ; Pardon my wish , it is a fair ambition , And well becomes the Man that honors you ; I wou 'd I were of worth , of something near you , Of such a royal piece , a King I wou 'd be , A mighty King that might command affection , And bring a youth upon me might bewitch ye , And you a sweet sould Christian .
Now you talk Sir ; You Portugals , though you be rugged Soldiers , Yet when you list to flatter , you are plain Courtiers ; And could you wish me Christian , brave Ruy Dias ?
At all the danger of my life great Lady , At all my hopes , at all --
Pray ye stay a little , To what end runs your wish ?
O glorious Lady , That I might -- but I dare not speak .
I dare then , That you might hope to marry me ; nay blush not , An honorable end needs no excuse ; And would you love me then ?
My soul not dearer .
Do some brave thing that may entice me that way , Some thing of such a meritorious goodness , Of such an unmatcht nobleness , that I may knowYou have a power beyond ours that preserves you : 'T is not the person , nor the royal title , Nor wealth , nor glory , that I look upon , That inward man I love that 's lin 'd with virtue , That well deserving soul works out a favor ; I have many Princes suiters , many great ones , Yet above these I love you , you are valiant , An active man , able to build a fortune ; I do not say I dote , nor meane to marry , Only the hope is , something may be done , That may compel my faith , and ask my freedome , And leave opinion fair .
Command dear Lady , And let the danger be as deep as Hell , As direful to attempt --
Y'are too sudden , I must be rul 'd by you , find out a fortuneWisely , and hansomely , examine time , And court occasion that she may be ready ; A thousand uses for your forward spiritYe may find daily , be sure ye take a good one , A brave and worthy one that may advance ye , Forc 'd smiles reward poor dangers ; you are a Soldier , I wou 'd not talke so else , and I love a Soldier , And that that speaks him true , and great , his valor ; Yet for all these which are but Womens follies , You may do what you please , I shall still know ye , And though ye weare no Sword .
Excellent Lady , When I grow so cold , and disgrace my Nation , That from their hardy nurses suck adventures , 'Twere fit I wore a Tombstone ; you have read to meThe story of your favor , if I mistake it , Or grow a truant in the study of it , A great correction Lady --
Let 's toth ' banquet , And have some merrier talk , and then to Court , Where I give audience to my general Suiters ; Pray heaven my womans wit hold ; there brave Captain , You may perchance meet something that may startle ye ; I 'll say no more , come be not sad -- I love ye. [ Exeunt .
Pyniero , Armusia , Soza , Christophero , and Emanuel .
You are wellcome Gentlemen , most worthy welcom , And know there 's nothing in our power may serve ye , But you may freely challenge .
Sir we thank ye , And rest your servants too .
Ye are worthy Portugals , You shew the bravery of your minds and spirits ; The nature of our Country too , that brings forthStirring , unwearied soules to seek adventures ; Minds never satisfied with search of honorWhere time is , and the Sun gives light , brave Countrymen , Our names are known , new worlds disclose their riches , Their beauties , and their prides to our embraces ; And we the first of Nations find these wonders .
These noble thoughts , Sir , have intic 'd us forward , And minds unapt for ease to see these miracles , In which we find report a poor relater ; We are arriv 'd among the blessed Islands , Where every wind that rises blows perfumes , And every breath of air is like an Incence : The treasure of the Sun dwells here , each TreeAs if it envied the old Paradice , Strives to bring forth immortal fruit ; the SpicesRenewing nature , though not deifying , And when that falls by time , scorning the earth , The sullen earth should taint or suck their beauties , But as we dreamt , for ever so preserve us : Nothing we see , but breeds an admiration ; The very rivers as we float along , Throw up their pearls , and curle their heads to court us ; The bowels of the earth swell with the birthsOf thousand unknown gemms , and thousand riches ; Nothing that bears a life , but brings a treasure ; The people they shew brave too , civil manner 'd , Proportioned like the Masters of great minds , The Women which I wonder at --
Ye speak well .
Of delicate aspects , fair , clearly beauteous , And to that admiration , sweet and courteous .
And is not that a good thing ? brave ArmusiaYou never saw the Court before ?
No certain , But that I see a wonder too , all excellent , The Government exact .
Ye shall see anon , That that will make ye start indeed , such beauties , Such riches , and such form .
Bakam , Syana , Governor .
We are fire already ; The wealthy Magazine of nature sureInhabits here .
These sure are all Ilanders .
Yes , and great Princes too , and lusty lovers .
They are goodly persons ; What might he be SigniorThat bears so proud a state ?
King of Bakam , A fellow that farts terror .
He looks highly , Sure he was begot o'th ' top of a Steeple .
It may well be , For you shall hear him ring anon .
That is Syana , And a brave temper 'd fellow , and more valiant .
What rugged face is that ?
That 's the great Governor , The man surpriz 'd our Friend , I told ye of him .
'Has dangerous eyes .
A perilous Thief , and subtile .
And to that subtilty a heart of Iron .
Yet the young Lady makes it melt .
They start all , And thunder in the eyes .
Away ye poor ones , A [ m ] I in competition with such bubbles ? My virtue , and my name rank 'd with such trifles ?
Ye speak loud .
Young-man , I will speak louder ; Can any man but I deserve her favor , [ Princes flie at one another. ] You petty Princes .
He will put 'em all in 's pocket .
Thou proud mad thing be not so full of glory , So full of vanity .
How ? I contemn thee , And that fort-keeping fellow .
How the Dog looks , The bandog Governor !
Ha , Why ?
Away thing , And keep your rank with those that fit your royalty ; Call out the Princess .
Dost thou know me bladder , Thou insolent impostume ?
I despise thee ;
Art thou acquainted with my nature baby ? With my revenge for Injuries ? darst thou hold meSo far behind thy file , I can not reach thee ? What canst thou merit ?
Merit ? I am above it ; I am equal with all honors , all atchievements , And what is great and worthy ; the best doerI keep at my command , fortune 's my servant , 'T is in my power now to despise such wretches , To look upon ye slightly , and neglect ye , And but she daines at some hours to remember ye , And people have bestowed some Titles on ye , I should forget your names --
Mercy of me ; What a blown fool has self affectionMade of this fellow ! did not the Queen your MotherLong for bellows , and bagpipes , when she was great with ye , She brought forth such a windy birth ?
'T is ten to oneShe eat a Drum , and was deliver 'd of alarum , Or else he was swadled in an old saile when he was young .
He swells too mainly with his meditations ; Faith , talk a little handsomer , ride softlyThat we may be able to hold way with ye , we are Princes , But those are but poor things to you ; talk wiser , 'Twill well become your mightiness ; talk less , That men may think ye can do more .
Talk truth , That men may think ye are honest , and believe ye , Or talk your self asleep , for I am weary of you .
Why ? I can talk and do .
That wou 'd do excellent .
And tell you , only I deserve the Princess , And make good only I , if you dare , you sir , Or you Syanas Prince .
Heres a storm toward , Methinks it sings already , to him Governor .
Here lies my proof. [ Draw .
And mine .
I 'll be short with ye , For these long arguments I was never good at .
How white the boaster looks !
Ruy Dias , Quisara , Quisana , Panura .
I see he lacks faith .
For shame forbear great Princes , rule your angers , You violate the freedom of this place , The state and Royalty --
He 's well contentedIt seems , and so I have done .
Is this she Signior ?
This is the Princess Sir .
She is sweet and goodly , An admirable form , they have cause to justle .
Ye wrong me and my court , ye forward Princes ; Comes your Love wrapt in Violence to seek us ? Is't fit though you be great , my presence should beStain 'd , and polluted with your bloody rages ? My privacies affrighted with your Swords ? He that loves me , loves my command ; be temper 'd , Or be no more what ye profess , my Servants .
We are calme as peace .
What command she carries ! And what a sparkling Majesty flies from her !
Is it ye love to do ? ye shall find danger , And danger that shall start your resolutions , But not this way ; 't is not contention , Who loves me to my face best , or who can flatter mostCan carry me , he that deserves my favor , And will enjoy what I bring , love and Majesty , Must win me with his worth ; must travel for me ; Must put his hasty rage off , and put onA well confirmed , a temperate , and true valor .
But shew the way .
And will , and then shew youA will to tread the way , I 'll say ye are worthy .
What task nowWill she turn 'em to ? these hot youths , I fear will find a cooling card , I read in her eyesSomething that has some swinge must flye amongst 'em ; By this hand I love her a little now .
'T is not unknown to youI had a royal Brother , now miserable , And Prisoner to that Man ; if I were ambitious , Gap 'd for that glory was n 're born with me , There he should lie his miseries upon him : If I were covetous , and my heart setOn riches , and those base effects that followOn pleasures uncontrol 'd , or safe revenges , There he should die , his death [ would ] give me all these ; For then stood I up absolute to do all ; Yet all these flattering shews of dignity , These golden dreams of greatness can not forceTo forget nature and my fair affection.Therefore that Man that would be known my lover , Must be known his redeemer , and must bring himEither alive or dead to my embraces.For even his bones I scorn shall feel such slavery , Or seek another Mistriss , 'twill be hardTo do this , wondrous hard , a great adventure , Fit for a spirit of an equal greatness ; But being done , the reward is worthy of it .
How they stand gaping all !
Ruy Dias cold ? Not flye like fire into it ? may be you doubt me , He that shall do this is my husband Prince ; By the bright heavens he is , by whose justiceI openly proclaim it ; if I lye , Or seek to set you on with subtilty , Let that meet with me , and reward my falshood.No stirring yet , no start into a bravery ?
Madam , it may be , but being a main danger , Your Grace must give me leave to look about me , And take a little time , the cause will ask it.Great Acts require great counsels .
Take your pleasure , I fear the Portugal .
I 'll raise an ArmyThat shall bring back [ h ] is Island , Fort and all , And fix it here .
How long will this be doing ? You should have begun in your Grandfather 's days .
What may be , And what my power can promise noblest Lady , My will I am sure stands fair .
Faire be your fortune , Few promises are best , and fair performance .
These can not doe , Their power and arts are weak ones.'Tis in my will , I have this King your brother , He is my prisoner , I accept your proffer , And bless the fair occasion that atchiev 'd him : I love ye , and I honor ye , but speak ; Whether alive or dead he shall be rendred , And see how readily , how in an instant , Quick as your wishes Lady --
No , I scorn ye , You and your courtesie ; I hate your love Sir ; And ere I would so basely win his liberty , I would study to forget he was my brother ; By force he was taken ; he that shall enjoy me , Shall fetch him back by force , or never know me .
As I live , a rare Wench .
She has a noble spirit .
By force ?
Yes Sir , by force , and make you glad tooTo let him goe .
How ? you may look nobler on me , And think me no such Boy ; by force he must not , For your love much may be .
Put up your passion , And pack ye home , I say , by force , and suddenly.He lies there till he rots else , although I love himMost tenderly and dearly , as a brother , And out of these respects would joy to see him ; Yet to receive him as thy courtesie , With all the honor thou couldst add unto himFrom his hands that most hate him , I had rather , Though no condition were propounded for him , See him far sunke i'th earth , and there forget him .
Your hopes are gelt good Governor .
A rare Woman .
Lady , I 'll pull this pride , I 'll quench this bravery , And turne your glorious scorn to tears and howlings ; I will proud Princess ; this neglect of meShall make thy brother King most miserable ; Shall turn him into curses 'gainst thy cruelty : For where before I us 'd him like a King , And did those Royal Offices unto him : Now he shall lie a sad lump in a dungeon , Loden with chains and fetters , colds and hunger , Darkness , and lingring death for his companions ; And let me see who dare attempt his rescue , What desperate fool ? look toward it ; farewel , And when thou know'st him thus , lament thy follies , Nay I will make thee kneel to take my offer : Once more farewel , and put thy trust in puppits. [ Exit .
If none dare undertake it , I 'll live a mourner .
You can not want .
You must not .
'T is most dangerous , And wise men wou 'd proceed with care and counsel , Yet some way would I knew -- Walke with me Gentlemen -- [ Exeunt. Manent , Arm. and his Comp .
How do you like her spirit ?
'T is a clear one , Clog 'd with no dirty stuff , she is all pure honor .
The bravest Wench I ever look 'd upon , And of the strongest parts , she is most fair , Yet her mind such a mirrour --
What an actionWou 'd this be to put forward on , what a glory , And what an everlasting wealth to end it ! Methinks my soul is strangely rais 'd .
To step into it , Just while they think , and ere they have determin'dTo bring the King off .
Things have been done as dangerous .
And prosper 'd best when they were least consider 'd .
Bless me my hopes , And you my friends assist me.None but our companions .
You deale wisely , And if we shrink the name of slaves dye with us .
Stay not for second thoughts .
I am determin 'd ; And though I lose , it shall be sung , I was valiant , And my brave offer shall be turn 'd to story , Worthy the Princess tongue. A Boat , that 's allThat 's unprovided , and habits like to Merchants , The rest wee'l councel as we goe .
Away then , Fortune looks fair on those , make haste to win her. [ Exeunt .
I Have kept many a Man , and many a great one , Yet I confess , I nere saw beforeA Man of such a sufferance ; he lies nowWhere I would not lay my dog , for sure 'twould kill him.Where neither light or comfort can come near him ; Nor air , nor earth that 's wholsome ; it grieves meTo see a mighty King with all his glory , Sunk o'th ' sudden to the bottome of a dungeon.Whether should we descend that are poor RascalsIf we had our deserts ?
'T is a strange wonder , Load him with Irons , oppress him with contempts , Which are the Governors commands , give him nothing , Or so little , to sustain life , 't is next nothing ; They stir not him , he smiles upon his miseries , And beares 'em with such strength , as if his natureHad been nurs 'd up , and foster 'd with calamities .
He gives no ill words , curses , nor repines not , Blames nothing , hopes in nothing , we can hear of ; And in the midst of all these frights , fears nothing .
I 'll be sworneHe fears not , for even when I shake for him , As many times my pitty will compell me , When other souls , that bear not half his burthen , Shrink in their powers , and burst with their oppressions ; Then will he Sing , wooe his afflictions , And court 'em in sad airs , as if he wou 'd wed 'em .
That 's more than we have heard yet , we are onlyAppointed for his Guard , but not so near him , If we could hear that wonder --
Many timesI fear the Governor should come to know it ; For his voice so affects me , so delights me , That when I find his hour , I have Musick ready , And it stirs me infinitely , be but still and private , And you may chance to hear. [ King appears loden with chains , his head , and armes only above .
We will not stir , Sir ; This is a sudden change , but who dares blame it .
Now hark and melt , for I am sure I shall ; Stand silent , what stubborn weight of chains --
Yet he looks temperately .
His eyes not sunk , and his complexion firm still , No wildness , no distemper 'd touch upon him , How constantly he smiles , and how undanted ! With what a Majesty he heaves his head up ! [ Musick .
Now marke , I know he will sing ; do not disturb him.Your allowance from the Governor , wou 'd it were more sir , Or in my power to make it hansomer .
Do not transgress thy charge , I take his bounty , And fortune , whilst I bear a mind contentedNot leaven 'd with the glory I am falen from , Nor hang upon vain hopes , that may corrupt me .
Thou art my slave , and I appear above thee .
The Governor himself .
What , at your banquet ? And in such state , and with such change of service ?
Nature 's no glutton , Sir , a little serves her .
This diet 's holsome then .
I beg no better .
A calm contented mind , give him less next ; These full meals will oppress his health , his GraceIs of a tender , and pure constitution , And such repletions --
Mock , mock , it moves not me sir , Thy mirths , as do thy mischiefs , flie behind me .
Ye carry it handsomely , but tell me patience , Do not you curse the brave and royal LadyYour gracious sister ? do not you damn her pitty , Damn twenty times a day , and damn it seriously ? Do not you swear aloud too , cry and kick ? The very soul sweat in thee with the agonyOf her contempt of me ? Couldst not thou eat herFor being so injurious to thy fortune , Thy fair and happy fortune ? Couldst not thou wish herA Bastard , or a Whore , fame might proclame her ; Black ugly fame , or that thou hadst had no sister ? Spitting the general name out , and the nature ; Blaspheming heaven for making such a mischief ; For giving power to pride , and will to Woman ?
No Tyrant , no , I bless and love her for it ; And though her scorn of thee , had laid up for meAs many plagues as the corrupted air breeds , As many mischiefs as the hours have minutes , As many formes of Death , as doubt can figure ; Yet I should love [ her ] more still , and more honor her ; All thou canst lay upon me , can not bend me , No not the stroke of death , that I despise too : For if fear could possess me , thou hadst won me ; As little from this hour I prize thy flatteries , And less than those thy prayers , though thou wouldst kneel to me ; And if she be not Mistriss of this nature , She is none of mine , no kin , and I contemne her .
Are you so valiant sir ?
Yes , and so fortunate ; For he that holds his constancy still conquers ; Hadst thou preserv 'd me as a noble enemy , And as at first , made my restraint seem to meBut only as the shadow of captivity , I had still spoke thee noble , still declar 'd theeA valiant , great , and worthy man , still lov 'd thee , And still prefer 'd thy fair love to my sister ; But to compell this from me with a misery , A most inhumane , and unhandsome slavery --
You will relent for all this talk I fear not , And put your wits a work agen .
You are cozen 'd ; Or if I were so weak to be wrought to it , So fearful to give way to so much poverty , How I should curse her heart if she consented !
You shall write , and entreat , or --
Do thy utmost , And e'en in all thy tortures I 'll laugh at thee , I 'll think thee no more valiant , but a villain ; Nothing thou hast done brave , but like a thief , Atchiev 'd by craft , and kept by cruelty ; Nothing thou canst deserve , thou art unhonest ; Nor no way live to build a Name , thou art barbarous .
Down with him low enough , there let him murmur , And see his diet be so light and little , He grow not thus high hearted o n't , I will coole ye , And make ye cry for mercy , and be readyTo work my ends , and willingly ; and your sister taken down , Your scornful , cruel sister shall repent too , And sue to me for grace.Give him no liberty , But let his bands be doubled , his ease lessened ; Nothing his heart desires , but vex and torture him : Let him not sleep , nothing that 's dear to natureLet him enjoy ; yet take heed that he dye not ; Keep him as near death , and as willing to embrace it , But see he arrive not at it ; I will humble him.And her stout heart that stands on such defiance ; And let me see her champions that dare ventureHer high and mighty wooers , keep your guards close , And as you love your lives be diligent.And what I charge , observe .
We shall be dutiful .
I 'll pull your courage King , and all your bravery. [ Exit Gov .
Most certain he is resolved nothing can stir him ; For if he had but any part about himGave way to fear or hope , he durst not talk thus , And do thus stoutly too , as willingly , And quietly he sunk down to his sorrows , As some men [ to ] their sleeps .
Yes , and sleeps with e 'm ; So little he regards them , there 's the wonder , And often soundly sleeps , wou 'd I durst pity him , Or wou 'd it were in my will , but we are servants , And tied unto command .
I wish him better , But much I fear h'as found his tombe already , We must observe our guards .
He can not last long , And when he is dead , he is free .
That 's the most cruelty , That we must keep him living .
That 's as he please ; For that Man that resolves , needs no Phisitian. [ Exeunt .
Armusia , Soza , Emanuel like Merchants , arm'dunderneath .
Our prosperous passage was an omen to us , A lucky and a fair omen .
We believe it .
The Sea and Wind strove who should most befriend us , And as they favour 'd our design , and lov 'd us , So lead us forth -- Where lies the Boat that brought us ?
Safe lodg 'd within the Reeds , close by the Castle , That no eye can suspect , nor thought come near it .
But where have you been , brave sir ?
I have broke the Ice Boyes : I have begun the game , fair fortune guide it , Suspectless have I travell 'd all the Town through , And in this Merchants shape won much acquaintance , Survey 'd each strength and place that may befriend us , View 'd all his Magazines , got perfect knowledgeOf where the Prison is , and what power guards it .
These will be strong attempts .
Courage is strong : What we beg [ a ] n with policy , my dear friends , Let 's end with manly force ; there 's no retiring , Unless it be with shame .
Shame his that hopes it .
Better a few , and clearer fame will follow us , However , lose or win , and speak our memories , Than if we led our Armies ; things done thus , And of this noble weight , will stile us worthies .
Direct , and we have done , bring us to execute , And if we flinch , or fail --
I am sure ye dare not.Then farther know , and let no ear be near us , That may be false .
Speak boldly on , we are honest ; Our lives and fortunes yours .
Hard by the place thenWhere all his Treasure lies , his Armes , his Women , Close by the Prison too where he keeps the King , I have hir 'd a lodging , as a Trading Merchant , A Celler to that too , to stow my Wares in , The very Wall of which , joynes to his store-house .
What of all this ?
Ye are dull , if ye apprehend not : Into that Cellar , elected friends , I have convey 'd , And unsuspected too , that that will do it ; That that will make all shake , and smoak too .
Ha ?
My thoughts have not been idle , nor my practice : The fire I brought here with me shall do something , Shall burst into material flames , and bright ones , That all the Island shall stand wondring at it , As if they had been stricken with a Comet : Powder is ready , and enough to work it , The Match is left a-fire , all , all husht , and lockt close , No man suspecting what I am but Merchant : An hour hence , my brave friends , look for the fury , The fire to light us to our honour 'd purpose , For by that time 'twill take .
What are our duties ?
When all are full of fear and fright , the GovernorOut of his wits , to see the flames so imperious , Ready to turn to ashes all he worships , And all the people there to stop these ruins , No man regarding any private office ; Then flie we to the prison suddenly , Here 's one has found the way , and dares direct us .
Then to our swords and good hearts , I long for it .
Certain we shall not find much opposition , But what is must be forced .
'T is bravely cast Sir , And surely too I hope .
If the fire fail not , And powder hold his nature , some must presentlyUpon the first cry of th ' amazed people , ( For nothing will be markt then , but the misery ) Be ready with the boat upon an instant , And then all 's right and fair .
Bless us dear fortune .
Let us be worthy of it in our courage , And fortune must befriend us , come all sever , But keep still within sight , when the flame risesLet 's meet , or either doe , or dye .
So be it. [ Exeunt .
No Captain , for those Troops we need 'em not , The Town is strong enough to stand their furies ; I wou 'd see 'em come , and offer to do something.They are high in words .
'T is safer Sir then doing .
Dost think they dare attempt ?
May be by Treaty , But sure by force they will not prove so froward .
No faith , I warrant thee , they know me well enoughAnd know they have no Child in hand to play with : They know my nature too , I have bit some of 'em , And to the bones , they have reason to remember me , It makes me laugh to think how gloriousThe fools are in their promises , and how pregnantTheir wits and powers are to bring things to pass ; Am I not grown lean with loss of sleep and careTo prevent these threatnings , Captain ?
You look well Sir : Upon my conscience you are not like to sickenUpon any such conceit .
I hope I shall not : Well , wou 'd I had this Wench , for I must have her , She must be mine ; and there 's another charge Captain ; What betwixt love and brawling I got nothing , All goes in maintenance -- Heark , What was that , [ The Train takes.That noise there ? it went with a violence .
Some old wall belike Sir , That had no neighbor help to hold it up , Is fallen suddenly .
I must discard these Rascals , That are not able to maintain their buildings , They blur the beauty of the Town .
Fire , Fire .
I hear another tune , good Captain , It comes on fresher still , 't is loud and fearful , Look up into the Town , how bright the ayr shewes ; Upon my life some sudden fire. [ Ex. Cap.The bell too ? [ Bell Rings.I hear the noise more clear .
Fire , fire .
Where ? where ?
Suddenly taken in a Merchan [ t ] s house sir , Fearful and high it blazes ; help good people .
Pox o'their paper-houses , how they smother , They light like Candles , how the rore still rises !
Your Magazine 's a fire Sir , help , help suddenly , The Castle too is in danger , in much danger , All will be lost , get the people presently , And all that are your Guard , and all help , all hands Sir , Your wealth , your strength , is burnt else , the Town perisht ; The Castle now begins to flame .
My soul shakes .
A Merchants house next joyning ? shame light on him , That ever such a neighbour , such a villain --
Raise all the Garrison , and bring 'em up .
And beat the people forward -- Oh I have lost allIn one house , all my hopes : good worthy CitizensFollow me all , and all your powers give to me , I will reward you all. Oh cursed fortune -- The flame 's more violent : arise still , help , help , Citizens , Freedom and wealth to him that helps : follow , oh follow.Fling wine , or any thing , I 'll see't recompenc'd.Buckets , more Buckets ; fire , fire , fire. [ Ex. omnes .

Let it flame on , a comely light it gives upTo our discovery .
Heark , what a merry cryThese hounds make ! forward fairly , We are not seen in the mist , we are not noted. Away , Away. Now if we lose our fortune -- [ Exit .
Up Soldiers , up , and deal like men .
More water , more water , all is consum 'd else .
All 's gone , unless you undertake it straight , yourWealth too , that must preserve , and pay your labor bravely.Up , up , away. [ Ex. Cap. and Cit. Then,
Armusia and his company breaking open a Doore .
So , thou art open , keep the way clearBehind still. Now for the place .
'T is here Sir .
Sure this is it.Force ope the doore -- A miserable creature ! Yet by his manly face -- [ The King discovered .
Why stare ye on me ? You can not put on faces to afright me : In death I am a King still , and contemne ye : Where is that Governor ? Methinks his Man-hoodShould be well pleas 'd to see my Tragedy , And come to bath his stern eyes in my sorrows ; I dare him to the sight , bring his scorns with him , And all his rugged threats : here 's a throat , soldiers ; Come , see who can strike deepest .
Break the Chain there .
What does this mean ?
Come , talke of no more Governors , He has other business , Sir , put your Legs forward , And gather up your courage like a Man , Wee 'll carry off your head else : we are friends , And come to give your sorrows ease .
On bravely ; Delayes may lose agen .
The Guard .
Upon 'em .
Make speedy , and sure work .
They flie .
Up with him , and to the Boat ; stand fast , now be speedy ; When this heat 's past , wee 'll sing our History.Away , like thoughts , sudden as desires , friends ; Now sacred chance be ours .
Pray when we have done , Sir. [ Exeunt .
What is the fire allaid ?
'T is out , 't is out , Or past the worst , I never did so stoutlyI 'll assure you neighbours since I was a Man : I have been burnt at both ends like a squib : I liv 'd two hours in the ' fire , 't was a hideous matter ; But when men of understanding come about it , Men that judge of things , my Wife gave me over , And took her leave a hundred times , I bore up still , And tost the Buckets Boys .
We are all meere Martins .
I heard a voice at latter end o'th hurry , Or else I dreamt I heard it , that said Treason .
'T is like enough , it might cry Murder too , for there wasMany without a joint , but what 's that to us : Let 's homeAnd fright our Wives , for we look like Devils .
Here come some of 'em to fright us .
Mine 's alive neighbor -- oh sweet hony husband .
Thou liest , I think abominably , and thou hadst beenIn my place , thou wouldst have stunk at both ends.Get me some drink , give me whole Tuns of drink , Whole cisterns ; for I have four dozen of fine firebrandsIn my belly , I have more smoke in my mouth , than wouldBlote a hundred Herrings .
Art thou come safe agen ?
I pray you what became of my man , is he in a Well ?
At hearts ease in a Well , is very well neighbor ; We left him drinking of a new dozen of Buckets ; Thy husbands happy , he was through roasted , And now he 's basting of himself at all points : The Clark and he are cooling their pericraniums ; Body [ O ] me neighbors there 's fire in my Codpiece .
Bless my Husband .
Blow it out Wife -- blow , blow , the gable end a'th ' store-house .
Some water , water , water .
Peace , 't is but a sparkle ; Raise not the Town again , 'twill be a great hindrance , I 'm glad 't is out , and't had ta'en in my Hay-loft ? What frights are [ t ] hese , marry heaven bless thy modicum .
But is a drown 'd outright , pray put me out ofFear neighbor .
Thou wouldst have it so , but after a hundred firesMore , he 'll live to see thee burnt for brewing mustyLiquor .
Come , let 's go neighbor .
For I would very fain turn down this liquor ; Come , come , I fry like a burnt mary-bone : Women get you afore , and draw upon us ; Run wenches , run , and let your Taps run with ye ; Run as the fire were in your tails , cry Ale , Ale .
Away , let 's nourish the poor wretches .
We 'll rallie up the rest of the burnt Regiment .
The fire 's quencht Captain , but the mischief hangs still ; The King 's redeem 'd , and gone too ; a trick , a dam 'd one : Oh I am overtaken poorly , tamely .
Where were the guard that waited upon the prison ?
Most of'em slain , yet some scap 'd , Sir , and they deliver , They saw a little boat ready to receive him , And those redeem 'd him , making such haste and fighting ; Fighting beyond the force of men .
I am lost Captain , And all the world will laugh at this , and scorn me : Count me a heavy sleepy fool , a coward , A coward past recovery , a confirm 'd coward , One without carriage , or common sense .
Hee 's gon Sir , And put to Sea amaine , past our recovery , Not a Boat ready to pursue ; if there were any , The people stand amazed so at their valor , And the sudden fright of fire , none knows to execute .
Oh , I could tear my limbs , and knock my boys brains'Gainst every post I meet ; fool 'd with a fire ?
It was a crafty trick .
No , I was lazy , Confident sluggish lazie , had I but met 'emAnd chang 'd a dozen blowes , I had forgiv'n 'em , By both these hands held up , and by that brightnessThat gildes the world with light , by all our worships , The hidden ebbes and flowes of the blew Ocean , I will not rest ; no mirth shall dwell upon me , Wine touch my mouth , nor any thing refresh me , Till I be wholly quit of this dishonor : Make ready my Barrato 's instantly , And what I shall intend --
We are your servants. [ Exeunt .
Quisara , Ruy Dyas .
Never tell me , you never car 'd to win me , Never for my sake to attempt a deed , Might draw me to a thought , you sought my favor : If not for love of me , for love of armes Sir , For that cause you profess , for love of honor , Of which you stile your self the mighty Master , You might have stept out nobly , and made an offer , As if you had intended something excellent , Put on a forward face .
Dear Lady hold me --
I hold ye , as I find ye , a faint servant .
By -- -- I dare doe --
In a Ladies chamberI dare believe ye , there 's no mortal danger : Give me the man that dares do , to deserve that : I thought you Portugals had been rare wonders , Men of those haughty courages and credits , That all things were confin 'd within your promises , The Lords of fate and fortune I believ 'd ye , But well I see I am deceiv 'd Ruy Dias , And blame , too late , my much beliefe .
am asham 'd , Lady , I was so dull , so stupid to your offer : Now you have once more school 'd me , I am right , And something shall be thought on suddenly , And put in Act as soon , some preparation --
And give it out ?
Yes , Lady , and so great too ; In which , the noise of all my Countrey-men --
Those will do well , for they are all approv 'd ones , And though he be restor 'd alive .
I have ye .
For then we are both servants .
I conceive ye , Good Madam give me leave to turn my fancies .
Do , and make all things fit , and then I 'll visit you. [ Ex .
My self , the Cozen , and the Garrison , The neighbors of the out-Isles of our Nation,
strength , for I can humor him : And proud Bekamus , I shall deceive his glory. [ A shout.What ringing sound of joy is this ? whence comes it ? May be the Princes are in sport .
Pyniero , Christoph .
Where are ye ?
Now Pyniero , What 's the haste you seek me ?
Doe you know this sign Sir ?
Ha !
Do you know this embleme : Your nose is boar 'd .
Boar 'd ? What 's that ?
Y'are topt Sir : The King 's come home again , the King .
The Devil !
Nay sure he came a Gods name home : He 's return 'd Sir .
And all this joy ye hear --
Who durst attempt him ? The Princes are all here .
They are worthy Princes , They are special Princes , all they love by ounces.Believe it Sir , 't is done , and done most bravely and easily.What fortune have ye lost Sir ? What justice have ye now unto this Lady ?
How stands your claim ? That ever Man should be fool 'd so , When he should do and prosper ; stand protesting , Kissing the hand , and farting for a favor , When he should be about his business sweating ; She bid you go , and pickt you out a purpose , To make your self a fortune by , a Lady , a Lady , and a lusty one , A lovely , that now you may go look , she pointed ye , Knowing you were a man of worth and merit , And bid you fly , you have made a fair flight o n't , You have caught a Goose .
How dare you thus molest me ? [ A shout.It can not be .
Heark how the general joy rings !
Have you your hearing left ? Is not that drunk too ? For if you had been sober , you had been wise sure .
Done ? Who dares do ?
It seems an honest fellow , That has ended his Market before you be up .
The shame o n't 's a stranger too .
'T is no shame , He took her at her word , and tied the bargain , Dealt like a man indeed , stood not demurring , But clapt close to the cause , as he will do to the Lady : 'Is a fellow of that speed and handsomness , He will get her with child too , ere you shall come to know him , Is it not brave , a gentleman scarce landed , Scarce eating of the air here , not acquainted , No circumstance of love depending on him , Nor no command to shew him , must start forth , At the first sight to --
I am undone .
Like an Oyster : She neither taking view , nor value of him , Unto such deeds as these -- Pox o ' these , These wise delayings -- They make men cowards.You are undone as a man would undoe an egge , A hundred shames about ye .
Quisara , Panura , and Traine .
Can it be possible , A stranger that I have not known , not seen yet , A man I never grac 'd ; O Captain , Captain , What shall I do ? I am betray 'd by fortune , It can not be , it must not be .
It is Lady , And by my faith a hansome Gentleman ; 'T is his poor Schollers prize .
Must I be givenUnto a Man I never saw , ne 're spoke with , I know not of what Nation ?
Is a Portugal , And of as good a pitch he will be giv'n to you Lady , For he 's given much to hansome flesh .
Oh Ruy Dias , This was your sloth , your sloth , your sloth Ruy Dias .
Your love sloth ; Unckle do you find it now ? You should have done at first , and faithfully : [ A shout.And then th'other had lyed ready for ye ; Madam , the general joy comes .
We must meet it -- but with what comfort ?
, boyes singing after 'em ;
King , Armusia , Soza , Emanuel ; The Princes and trainfollowing .
Oh my dear brother , what a joy runs through me , To see you safe again , your self , and mighty , What a blest day is this !
Rise up fair Sister , I am not welcome till you have embraced me .
A general gladness sir flies through the City , And mirth possesses all to see your Grace arrive , Thus happily arriv 'd again , and fairly ; 'T was a brave venture who so e'er put for it , A high and noble one , worthy much honor ; And had it fail 'd , we had not fail 'd great Sir , And in short time too , to have forc 'd the Governor , In spight of all his threats .
I thank ye Gentleman .
And all his subtilties to set you free , With all his heart and will too .
I know ye love me .
This had been good with something done before it , Something set off to beautifie it , now it sounds empty , likeA Barbers bason , pox there 's no metall i n't , no noble marrow .
I have an Army Sir , but that the Governor , The foolish fellow was a little provident , And wise in letting slip no time , became him too , That would have scour 'd him else , and all his confines ; That would have rung him such a peal --
Yes backward , To make dogs houl , I know thee to a farthing , Thy Army 's good for Hawks , there'sNothing but sheeps hearts in it .
I have done nothing Sir , thereforeI think it convenient I say little what I purposed , And what my love intended .
I like your modesty , And thank ye royal friends , I know it griev 'd yeTo know my misery ; but this man , Prince [ s ] , I must thank heartily , indeed , and treuly , For this Man saw me i n't , and redeemed me : He lookt upon me sinking , and then caught me.This Sister this , this all Man , this all valor , This pious Man .
My countenance , it shames me , One scarce arriv 'd , not harden 'd yet , notRead in dangers and great deeds , sea-sick , not season 'd -- Oh I have boy 'd my self .
This noble bulwark , This launce and honor of our age and Kingdome ; This that I never can reward , nor hopeTo be once worthy of the name of friend to , This , this Man from the bowels of my sorrowsHas new begot my name , and once more made me : Oh sister , if there may be thanks for this , Or any thing near recompence invented .
You are too noble Sir , there is rewardAbove my action too by millions : A recompence so rich and glorious , I durst not dreame it mine , but that 't was promised ; But that it was propounded , sworn and sealedBefore the face of Heaven , I durst not hope it , For nothing in the life of man , or merit , It is so truly great , can else embrace it .
O speak it , speak it , bless mine ears to hear it , Make me a happy man , to know it may be , For still methinks I am a prisoner , And feel no liberty before I find it .
Then know it is your sister , she is mine Sir , I claime her by her own word , and her honor ; It was her open promise to that ManThat durst redeeme ye ; Beauty set me on , And fortune crowns me fair , if she receive me .
Receive ye , Sir -- why Sister -- ha -- so backward , Stand as you knew me not ? nor what he has ventured ? My dearest Sister .
Good Sir pardon me , There is a blushing modesty becomes her , That holds her back ; Women are nice to wooe Sir ; I would not have her forc 'd ; give her fair liberty ; For things compell 'd and frighted , of soft natures , Turn into fears , and flie from their own wishes .
Look on him my Quisara , such another , Oh all ye powers , so excellent in nature ! In honor so abundant ! --
I confess Sir , Confess my word is past too , he has purchased ; Yet good Sir give me leave to think ; but timeTo be acquainted with his worth and person ; To make me fit to know it ; we are both strangers , And how we should believe so suddenly , Or come to fasten our affections -- Alas , love has his complements .
Be suddenAnd certain in your way , no woman [ s ] doubles , Nor coy delayes , you are his , and so assure it , Or cast from me and my remembrance ever ; Respect your word , I know you will , come Sister , Lets see what welcome you can give a prisoner , And what fair looks a friend -- Oh my most noblePrinces , no discontents , but all be lusty , He that frowns this day is an open enemy : Thus in my armes my dear .
You make me blush Sir .
And now lead on -- Our whole Court crown 'd with pleasure .
Madam , despair not , something shall be done yet , And suddenly , and wisely .
O Ruy Dias. [ Ex .
Well , he 's a brave fellow , and he has deserv 'd her richly ; And you have had your hands full I dare swear Gentlemen .
We have done something , Sir , if it hit right .
The woman has no eyes else , nor no honesty , So much I think .
Come , let 's goe bounce amongst 'em , To the Kings health , and my brave Country-mans.My Unckle looks as though he were sick oth'Worms friends. [ Exeunt .
Pyniero.Mine Unckle haunts me up and down , looks melancholy , Wondrous proof melancholy , sometimes swearsThen whistles , starts , cries , and groans , as if he had the Bots , As to say truth , I think h'as little better , A [ n ] d we 'd fain speak ; bids me good morrow at midnight , And good night when 't is noon , has something hoversAbout his brains , that would fain find an issue , But can not out , or dares not : still he follows .
Ruy Dyas.How he looks still , and how he beats about , Like an old dog at a dead scent ! I marry , There was a sigh wou 'd a set a ship a sailing : These winds of love and honor , blow at all ends.Now speak and't be thy Will : good morrow Uncle .
Good morrow Sir .
This is a new salute : Sure h'as forgot me : this is pur-blind Cupid .
My Nephew ?
Yes Sir , if I be not chang 'd .
I wou 'd fain speak with you .
I wou 'd fain have ye , Sir , For to that end I stay .
You know I love ye , And I have lov 'd ye long , my dear Pyniero , Bred and supply 'd you .
Whither walks this Preamble ?
You may remember , though I am but your Uncle , I sure had a father 's care , a father 's tenderness .
Sure he would wrap me into something now suddenly , He doubts my nature in , for mine is honest , He winds about me so .
A fathers diligence.My private benefits I have forgot , Sir , But those you might lay claim to as my follower ; Yet some men wou 'd remember --
I do daily .
The place which I have put ye in , which is no weak one , Next to my self you stand in all employments , Your counsels , cares , assignments with me equal , So is my study still to plant your person ; These are small testimonies I have not forgot ye , Nor wou 'd not be forgotten .
Sure you can not .
Oh Pyniero --
Sir , what hangs upon you , What heavy weight oppresses ye , ye have lost , ( I must confess , in those that understand ye ) Some little of your credit , but time will cure that ; The best may slip sometimes .
Oh my best Nephew --
It may be ye fear her too , that disturbs ye , That she may fall her self , or be forc 'd from ye .
She is ever true , but I undone for ever.Oh that Armusia , that new thing , that stranger , That flag stuck up to rob me of mine honor ; That murd'ring chain shot at me from my Countrey : That goodly plague that I must court to kill me .
Now it comes flowing from him , I fear 'd this , Knew , he that durst be idle , durst be ill too , Has he not done a brave thing ?
I must confess it Nephew , must allow it , But that brave thing has undone me , has sunk me , Has trod me like a name in sand , to nothing , Hangs betwixt hope and me , and threatens my ruin ; And if he rise and blaze , farewel my fortune ; And when that 's set , where 's thy advancement , Cosin ? That were a friend , that were a noble kinsman , That would consider these ; that man were grateful ; And he that durst do something here , durst love me .
You say true , 't is worth consideration , Your reasons are of weight , and mark me Uncle , For I 'll be sudden , and to th ' purpose with you.Say this Armusia , then were taken off , As it may be easily done , How stands the woman ?
She is mine for ever ; For she contemns his deed and him .
Pox on him.Or if the single pox be not sufficient , The hogs , the dogs , the devils pox possess him : 'Faith this Armusia stumbles me , 't is a brave fellow ; And if he could be spared Uncle --
I must perish : Had he set up at any rest but this , Done any thing but what concern 'd my credit , The everlasting losing of my worth --
I understand you now , who set you on too.I had a reasonable good opinion of the devilTill this hour ; and I see he is a knave indeed , An arrant , stinking knave , for now I smell him ; I 'll see what may be done then , you shall knowYou have a kinsman , but no villain Uncle , Nor no betrayer of fair fame , I scorn it ; I love and honor virtue ; I must haveAccess unto the Lady to know her mind too , A good word from her mouth you know may stir me ; A Ladies look at setting on --
You say well , Here Cosin , here 's a Letter ready for you , And you shall see how nobly she 'll receive you , And with what [ c ] are direct .
Farewel then Uncle , After I have talk 'd with her , I am your servant , To make you honest if I can -- else hate you.Pray ye no more compliments , my head is busie , heaven bless me ; What a malicious soul does this man carry ! And to what scurvy things this love converts us ! What stinking things , and how sweetly they become us ! Murther 's a moral virtue with these Lovers , A special piece of Divinity , I take it : I may be mad , or violently drunk.Which is a whelp of that litter ; or I may be covetous , And learn to murther mens estates , that 's base too ; Or proud , but that 's a Paradise to this ; Or envious , and sit eating of my selfAt others fortunes ; I may lye , and damnably , Beyond the patience of an honest hearer ; Cosin , Cutpurses , sit i'th ' Stocks for apples.But when I am a Lover , Lord have mercy , These are poor pelting sins , or rather plagues , Love and Ambition draw the devils Coach .
Quisana , and Panura.How now ! who are these ? Oh my great Ladies followers , Her Riddle-founders , and her Fortune-tellers.Her readers of her Love-Lectures , her Inflamers : These doors I must pass through , I hope they are wide.Good day to your beauties , how they take it to 'em ! As if they were fair indeed .
Good morrow to you , Sir .
That 's the old Hen , the brood-bird ! how she busles ! How like an Inventory of Lechery she looks ! Many a good piece of iniquityHas past her hands , I warrant her -- I beseech you , Is the fair Princess stirring ?
Yes marry is she , Sir.But somewhat private : you have a business with her ?
Yes forsooth have I , and a serious business .
May not we know ?
Yes , when you can keep counsel .
How prettily he looks ! he 's a soldier sure , His rudeness sits so handsomly upon him .
A good blunt Gentleman .
Yes marry am I : Yet for a push or two at sharp , and't please you --
My honest friend , you know not who you speak to : This is the Princesses Aunt,
I like her the betterAnd she were her Mother ( Lady ) or her Grandmother , I am not so bashful , but I can buckle with her .
Of what size is your business ?
Of the long sixteens , And will make way I warrant ye .
How fine he talks !
Nay in troth I talk but coursely , Lady , But I hold it comfortable for the understanding : How fain they wou 'd draw me into ribaldry ! These wenches that live easily , live high , [ And l ] ove these broad discourses , as they love possets ; These dry delights serve for preparatives .
Why do you look so on me ?
I am guessingBy the cast of your face , what the property of your place , should be , For I presume you turn a key , sweet beauty , And you another , gravity , under the Princess , And by my -- -- I warrant ye good places , Comly commodious Seats .
Prethee let him talk still.For me thinks he talks handsomely .
And trulyAs near as my understanding shall enable meYou look as if you kept my Ladies secrets : Nay , do not laugh , for I mean honestly , How these young things tattle , when they get a toy by th ' end ! And how their hearts go pit-a-pat , and look for it ! Wou 'd it not dance too , if it had a Fiddle ? Your gravity I guess , to take the Petitions , And hear the lingring suits in love dispos 'd , Their sighs and sorrows in their proper place , You keep the Ay-me Office .
Prethee suffer him , For as I live he 's a pretty fellow ; I love to hear sometimes what men think of us : And thus deliver 'd freely , 't is no malice : Proceed good honest man .
I will , good Madam.According to mens states and dignities , Moneys and moveables , you rate their dreams , And cast the Nativity of their desires , If he reward well , all he thinks is prosperous : And if he promise place , his dreams are Oracles ; Your antient practique Art too in these discoveries , Who loves at such a length , who a span farther , And who draws home , yield you no little profit , For these ye milk by circumstance .
Ye are cunning .
And as they oil ye , and advance your Spindle , So you draw out the lines of love , your doors too , The doors of destiny , that men must pass through ; These are fair places .
He knows all .
Your trap-doors , To pop fools in it , that have no providence , Your little wickets , to work wise men , like wires , through at , And draw their states and bodies into Cobwebs , Your Postern doors , to catch those that are cautelous , And would not have the worlds eye find their knaveries : Your doors of danger , some men hate a pleasure , Unless that may be full of fears ; your hope doors , And those are fine commodities , where fools payFor every new enco [ u ] ragement , a new custom ; You have your doors of honor , and of pleasure ; But those are for great Princes , glorious vanities , That travel to be famous through diseases ; There be the doors of poverty and death too : But these you do the best you can to damm up , For then your gain goes out .
This is a rare Lecture .
Read to them that understand .
Beshrew me , I dare not venture on ye , ye cut too keen , Sir .
Quisara .
We thank you Sir for your good mirth , You are a good companion.Here comes the Princess now , attend your business .
Is there no remedy , no hopes can help me ? No wit to set me free ? whose there hoe ?
Troubled ? her looks are almost wild : What ails the Princess ? I know nothing she wants .
Who 's that there with you ? Oh Signior Pyniero ? you are most welcome : How does your noble Uncle ?
Sad as you are Madam : But he commends his service , and this Letter .
Go off , attend within -- Fair Sir , I thank ye , Pray be no stranger , for indeed you are welcome ; For your own virtues welcome .
We are mistaken , This is some brave fellow sure .
I 'm sure he 's a bold fellow : But if she hold him so , we must believe it. [ Exit .
Do you know of this , fair Sir ?
I ghess it Madam , And whether it intends : I had not brought it else .
It is a business of no common reckoning .
The handsomer for him that goes about it ; Slight actions are rewarded with slight thanks : Give me a matter of some weight to wade in .
And can you love your Uncle so directly , So seriously , and so full , to undertake this ? Can there be such a faith ?
Dare you say I to it , And set me on ? 't is no matter for my Uncle , Or what I owe to him , dare you but wish it .
I wou 'd fain --
Have it done ; say but so Lady .
Conceive it so .
I will , 't is that I am bound to : Your Will that must command me , and your Pleasure , The fair aspects of those eyes that must direct me : I am no Uncles Agent , I am mine own , Lady ; I scorn my able youth should plough for others , Or my ambition serve for pay ; I aim , Although I never hit , as high as any man , And the reward I reach at , shall be equal , And what love spurs me on to , this desire , Makes me forget an honest man , a brave man , A valiant , and a virtuous man , my countrey-man , Armusia , The delight of all the Minions , This love of you , doting upon your beauty , the admiration of yourexcellence ; Make me but servant to the poorest smile , Or the least grace you have bestow 'd on others , And see how suddenly I 'll work your safety , And set your thoughts at peace ; I am no flatterer , To promise infinitely , and out-dream dangers ; To lye a bed , and swear men into Feavers , Like some of your trim suiters ; when I promise , The light is not more constant to the world , Than I am to my word -- She turns for millions .
I have not seen a braver confirm 'd courage .
For a Tun of Crowns she turns : she is a woman , And much I fear , a worse than I expected.You are the object , Lady , you are the eyeIn which all excellence appears , all wonder , From which all hearts take fire , all hands their valour : And when he stands disputing , when you bid him , Or but thinks of his Estate , Father , Mother , Friends , Wife , and Children , H'is a fool , and I scorn him , And 't be but to make clean his sword , a coward ; Men have forgot their fealty to beauty.Had I the place in your affections , My most unworthy Uncle is fit to fall from , Liv 'd in those blessed eyes , and read the storiesOf everlasting pleasures figur 'd there , I wou 'd find out your commands before you thought 'em , And bring 'em to you done , e'r you dream't of 'em .
I admire his boldness .
This , or any thing ; Your brothers death , mine Uncles , any mans , No state that stands secure , if you frown on it.Look on my youth , I bring no blastings to you , The first flower of my strength , my faith .
No more Sir ; I am too willing to believe , rest satisfi 'd ; If you dare do for me , I shall be thankful : You are a handsome Gentleman , a fair one , My servant if you please ; I seal it thus , Sir.No more , till you deserve more. [ Exit .
I am rewarded : This woman 's cunning , but she 's bloody too ; Although she pulls her Tallons in , she 's mischievous ; Form 'd like the face of Heaven , clear and transparent ; I must pretend still , bear 'em both in hopes , For fear some bloudy slave thrust in indeed , Fashion 'd and flesh 'd , to what they wish : well Uncle , What will become of this , and what dishonorFollow this fatal shaft , if shot , let time tell , I can but only fear , and strive to cross it.

Why are you thus sad ? what can grieve or vex youThat have the pleasures of the world , the profits , The honor , and the loves at your disposes ? Why should a man that wants nothing , want his quiet ?
I want what beggars are above me in , content ; I want the grace I have merited , The favor , the due respect .
Does not the King allow it ?
Yes , and all honors else , all I can ask , That he has power to give ; but from his Sister , The scornful cruelty , forgive me beauty , That I transgress from her that should look on me , That should a little smile upon my service , And foster my deserts for her own faiths sake ; That should at least acknowledge me , speak to me .
And you goe whining up and down for this , Sir ? Lamenting and disputing of your grievances ? Sighing and sobbing like a sullen School-boy , And cursing good-wife fortune for this favour ?
What would you have me doe ?
Doe what you should do , What a man would doe in this case , a wise man , An understanding man that knows a woman ; Knows her and all her tricks , her scorns , and all her trifles : Goe to her , and take her in your arms , and shake her , Take her and toss her like a barr .
But be sure you pitch her upon a Feather-bed , Shake her between a pair of Sheets , Sir , There shake these sullen fits out of her , spare her not there ; There you may break her Will , and bruise no bone , Sir .
Goe to her .
That 's the way .
And tell her , and boldly , And do not mince the matter , nor mock your self , With being too indulgent to her pride : Let her hear roundly from ye , what ye are , And what ye have deserved , and what she must be .
And be not put off like a common fellow , With the Princess would be private , Or that she has taken physick , and admits none ; I would talk to her any where .
It makes me smile .
Now you look handsomly : Had I a wench to win , I would so flutter her : They love a man that crushes 'em to verjuce ; A woman held at hard meat , is your Spaniel .
Pray take our council , Sir .
I shall do something , But not your way , it shews too boisterous , For my affections are as fair and gentle , As her they serve .
The King .
Why how now friend ? Why do you rob me of the companyI love so dearly , Sir , I have been seeking you ; For when I want you , I want all my pleasure : Why sad ? thus sad still man ? I will not have it ; I must not see the face I love thus shadowed .
And't please your Grace , methinks it ill becomes him : A soldier should be jovial , high and lusty .
He shall be so , come , come , I know your reason , It shall be none to cross you , ye shall have her , Take my word , ( 't is a Kings word ) ye shall have her , She shall be yours or nothing , pray be merry .
Your Grace has given me cause , I shall be Sir , And ever your poor servant .
Me my self , Sir , My better self , I shall find time , and suddainly , To gratifie your loves too , Gentlemen , And make you know how much I stand bound to you : Nay , 't is not worth your thanks , no further complement ; Will you go with me friend ?
I beseech your Grace , Spare me an hour or two , I shall wait on you , Some little private business with my self , Sir , For such a time .
I 'll hinder no devotion , For I know you are regular , I 'll take you Gentlemen , Because he shall have nothing to disturb him , I shall look for your friend. [ Exeunt. manet Armusia .

I dare not fail , Sir : What shall I do to make her know my misery , To make her sensible ? This is her woman , I have a toy come to me suddenly , It may work for the best , she can but scorn me , And lower than I am , I can not tumble , I 'll try , what e'er my fate be -- Good even fair one .
'T is the brave stranger -- A good night to you , Sir.Now by my Ladies hand , a goodly Gentleman ! How happy shall she be in such a Husband ! Wou 'd I were so provided too .
Good pretty one , Shall I keep you company for an hour or two ? I want employment for this evening.I am an honest man .
I dare believe ye : Or if ye were not , Sir , that 's no great matter , We take mens promises , wou 'd ye stay with me , Sir ?
So it please you , pray let 's be better acquainted , I know you are the Princesses Gentlewoman , And wait upon her near .
'T is like I do so .
And may befriend a man , do him fair courtesies , If he have business your way .
I understand ye .
So kind an office , that you may bind a gentleman , Hereafter to be yours ; and your way too , And ye may bless the hour you did this benefit : Sweet handsome faces should have courteous minds , And ready faculties .
Tell me your business , Yet if I think it be to her , your self , Sir , For I know what you are , and what we hold ye , And in what grace ye stand , without a second , For that but darkens , you wou 'd do it better , The Princess must be pleas 'd with your accesses ; I 'm sure I should .
I want a Courtiers boldness , And am yet but a stranger , I wou 'd fain speak with her:
'T is very late , and upon her hour of sleep , Sir .
Pray ye wear this , and believe my meaning civil , My business of that fair respect and carriage : This for our more acquaintance. [ Jewel .
How close he kisses ! And how sensible the passings of his lips are ! I must do it , and I were to be hang 'd now , and I will do it : He may do as much for me , that 's all I aim at ; And come what will o n't , life or death , I 'll do it , For ten such kisses more , and 'twere high treason .
I wou 'd be private with her .
So you shall , 'T is not worth thanks else , you must dispatch quick .
Suddenly .
And I must leave you in my chamber , Sir ; Where you must lock your self that none may see you ; 'T is close to her , you can not miss the entrance , When she comes down to bed .
I understand ye , and once more thank ye Lady .
Thank me but thus .
If I fail thee -- Come close then. [ Ex .
Quisara , and Quisana .
'T is late good Aunt , to bed , I am ev'n unready , My woman will not be long away .
I wou 'd have you a little merrier first , Let me sit by ye , and read or discourseSomething that ye fancy , or take my instrument .
No , no I thank you , I shall sleep without these , I wrong your age AuntTo make ye wait thus , pray let me intreat ye , To morrow I 'll see ye , I know y'are sleepy , And rest will be a welcome guest , you shall not , Indeed you shall not stay ; oh here 's my woman,
Panura.Good night , good night , and good rest Aunt attend you .
Sleep dwell upon your eyes , and fair dreams court ye .
Come , where have you been wench ? make me unready ; I slept but ill last night .
You 'll sleep the betterI hope [ too ] night , Madam .
A little rest contents me ; Thou lovest thy bed Panura .
I am not in love Lady , Nor seldom dream of devils , I sleep soundly .
I 'll swear thou dost , thy Husband wou 'd not take it so wellIf thou wert married wench .
Let him take , Madam , The way to waken me , I am no Dormouse , Husbands have larum bels , if they butRing once .
Thou art a merry wench .
I shall live the longer .
Prethee fetch my Book .
I am glad of that .
I 'll read awhile before I sleep .
I will Madam .
And if Ruy Dias meet you , and be importunate , He may come in .
I have a better fare for you , Now least in sight play I. [ Exit .
Armusia , locks the door .
Why should I love him ? Why should I doat upon a man deserves not , Nor has no will to work it ? who 's there wench ? What are you ? or whence come you ?
Ye may know me , I bring not such amazement , noble Lady .
Who let you in ?
My restless love that serves ye .
This is an impudence I have not heard of , A rudeness that becomes a thief or ruffian ; Nor shall my brothers love protect this boldness , You build so strongly on , my rooms are sanctuaries , And with that reverence , they that seek my favours , And humble fears , shall render their approaches .
Mine are no less .
I am Mistriss of my self , Sir , And will be so , I will not be thus visited : These fears and dangers thrust into my privacy.Stand further off , I 'll cry out else .
Oh dear Lady !
I see dishonor in your eyes .
There is none : By all that beauty they are innocent ; Pray ye tremble not , you have no cause .
I 'll dye first ; Before you have your Will , be torn in pieces ; The little strength I have left me to resist you , The gods will give me more , before I am forc'dTo that I hate , or suffer --
You wrong my duty .
So base a violation of my liberty ? I know you are bent unnobly ; I 'll take to meThe spirit of a man ; borrow his boldness , And force my womans fears into a madness , And e'er you arrive at what you aim at --
Lady , If there be in you any womans pity ; And if your fears have not proclaim 'd me monstrous ; Look on me , and believe me ; is this violence ? Is it to fall thus prostrate to your beautyA ruffians boldness ? is humility a rudeness ? The griefs and sorrows that grow here an impudence ? These forcings , and these fears I bring along with me ; These impudent abuses offered ye ; And thus high has your brothers favour blown me : Alas dear Lady of my life , I came notWith any purpose , rough or desperate , With any thought that was not smooth and gentle , As your fair hand , with any doubt or dangerFar be it from my heart to fright your quiet ; A heavy curse light on it , when I intend it .
Now I dare hear you .
If I had been mischievous , As then I must be mad ; or were a monster , If any such base thought had harbour 'd here , Or violence that became not man , You have a thousand bulwarks to assure you , The holy powers bear shields to defend chastity ; Your honor , and your virtues are such armours ; Your clear thoughts such defences ; if you mis-doubt stillAnd yet retain a fear , I am not honest , Come with impure thoughts to this place ; Take this , and sheath it here ; be your own safety ; Be wise , and rid your fears , and let me perish ; How willing shall I sleep to satisfie you .
No , I believe now , you speak worthily ; What came you then for ?
To complain me , beauty , But modestly .
Of what ?
Of your fierce cruelty , For though I dye , I will not blame the doer : Humbly to tell your grace , ye had forgot me : A little to have touch 'd at , not accused , For that I dare not do , your scorns , pray pardon meAnd be not angry that I use the libertyTo urge that word , a little to have shew 'd youWhat I have been , and what done to deserve ye , If any thing that love commands may reach ye : To have remembred ye , but I am unworthy , And to that misery falls all my fortunes , To have told ye , and by my life ye may believe me , That I am honest , and will only marryYou , or your memory ; pray be not angry .
I thank you Sir , and let me tell you seriously , Ye have taken now the right way to befriend ye , And to beget a fair and clear opinion , Yet to try your obedience --
I stand ready Lady.Without presuming to ask any thing .
Or at this time to hope for further favour ; Or to remember services or smiles ; Dangers you have past through , and rewards due to 'em ; Loves or despairs , but leaving all to me : Quit this place presently .
I shall obey ye .
Ruy Dias .
Ha ?
Who 's this ? What art thou ?
A Gentleman .
Thou art no more I 'm sure : oh 't is Ruy Dias ; How high he looks , and harsh !
Is there not door enough , You take such elbow room ?
If I take it , I 'll carry it .
Does this become you Princess ?
The Captain 's jealous.Jealous of that he never durst deserve yet ; Goe freely , goe , I 'll give thee leave .
Your leave , Sir ?
Yes my leave Sir , I 'll not be troubled neither , Nor shall my heart ake , or my head be jealous , Nor strange suspitious thoughts reign in my memory ; Go on , and do thy worst , I 'll smile at thee ; I kiss your fair hand first , then farewel Captain. [ Exit .
What a pure soul inherits here ! what innocence ! Sure I was blind when I first lov 'd this fellow , And long to live in that fogg still : how he blusters !
Am I your property ? or those your flatteries , The banquets that ye bid me to , the trustI build my goodly hopes on ?
Be more temperate .
Are these the shews of your respect and favour ? What did he here , what language had he with ye ? Did ye invite ? could ye stay no longer ? Is he so gracious in your eye ?
You are too forward .
Why at these private hours ?
You are too saucy , Too impudent to task me with those errors.Do ye know what I am Sir , and my prerogative ? Though you be a thing I have call 'd by th ' name of friend , I never taught you to dispose my liberty ; How durst you touch mine honor ? blot my meanings ? And name an action , and of mine but noble ? Thou poor unworthy thing , how have I grac 'd thee ! How have I nourisht thee , and raised thee hourly ! Are these the gratitudes you bring Ruy Dias ? The thanks ? the services ? I am fairly paid ; Was't not enough I saw thou wert a Coward , And shaddowed thee ? no noble sparkle in thee ? Daily provok 'd thee , and still found thee coward ? Rais 'd noble causes for thee , strangers started at ; Yet still , still , still a Coward , ever Coward ; And with those taints , dost thou upbraid my virtues ?
I was too blameLady .
So blindly bold to touch at my behaviour ? Durst thou but look amiss at my allowance ? If thou hadst been a brave fellow , thou hadst had some licenceSome liberty I might have then allowed theeFor thy good face , some scope to have argued with me ; But being nothing but a sound , a shape , The meer sign of a Soldier -- of a Lover.The dregs and draffy part , disgrace and jealousie , I scorn thee ; and contemn thee .
Dearest Lady , If I have been too free --
Thou hast been too foolish , And go on still , I 'll study to forget thee , I would I could , and yet I pity thee. [ Exit .
I am not worth it , if I were , that 's misery , The next door is but death , I must aim at it. [ Exit .
So far and truly you have discovered to meThe former currents of my life and fortune , That I am bound to acknowledge ye most holy , And certainly to credit your predictions , Of what are yet to come .
I am no lyer , 'T is strange I should , and live so near a neighbor ; But these are not my ends .
Pray ye sit good father , Certain a reverend man , and most religious .
Do Holy man , I 'll hear ye .
Beware these Portugals ; I say beware 'em , These smooth-fac 'd strangers ; have an eye upon 'em.The cause is now the God 's , hear , and believe King .
I do hear , but before I give rash credit , Or hang too light on belief , which is a sin , father ; Know I have found 'em gentle , faithful , valiant , And am in my particular , bound to 'em , I mean to some for my most strange deliverance .
Oh Son , the future aims of men , observe me , Above their present actions , and their glory , Are to be look 'd at , the Stars shew many turnings , If you could see , mark but with my eyes , pupil ; These men came hither , as my vision tells me , Poor weather-beaten , almost lost , starv 'd , feebled , Their vessels like themselves , most miserable ; Made a long sute for traffique , and for comfort , To vent their childrens toys , cure their diseases : They had their sute , they landed , and to th ' rateGrew rich and powerful , suckt the fat , and freedomOf this most blessed Isle , taught her to tremble , Witness the Castle here , the Citadel , They have clapt upon the neck of your Tidore , This happy Town , till that she knew these strangers , To check her when she 's jolly .
They have so indeed Father .
Take heed , take heed , I find your fair delivery , Though you be pleas 'd to glorifie that fortune , And think these strangers gods , take heed I say , I find it but a handsome preparation , A fair-fac 'd Prologue to a further mischief : Mark but the end good King , the pin he shoots atThat was the man deliver 'd ye ; the mirror , Your Sister is his due ; what 's she , your heir , Sir ? And what 's he a kin then to the kingdom ? But heirs are not ambitious , who then suffers ? What reverence shall the gods have ? and what justiceThe miserable people ? what shall they do ?
He points at truth directly .
Think of these Son : The person , nor the manner I mislike notOf your preserver , nor the whole man together , Were he but season 'd in the Faith we are , In our Devotions learn 'd .
You say right Father .
To change our Worships now , and our Religion ? To be traytor to our God ?
You have well advised me , And I will seriously consider Father , In the mean time you shall have your fair accessUnto my Sister , advise her to your purpose , And let me still know how the gods determine .
I will , but my main end is to adviseThe destruction of you all , a general ruine , And when I am reveng 'd , let the gods whistle. [ Exeunt .
Ruy Dias , and Pyniero .
Indeed , I am right glad ye were not greedy , And sudden in performing what I will 'd you , Upon the person of Armusia , I was afraid , for I well knew your valour , And love to me .
'T was not a fair thing , Uncle , It shew 'd not handsome , carried no man in it .
I must confess 't was ill ; and I abhor it , Only this good has risen from this evil ; I have tried your honesty , and find proof , A constancy that will not be corrupted , And I much honor it .
This Bell sounds better .
My anger now , and that disgrace I have suffer 'd , Shall be more manly vented , and wip 'd off , And my sick honor cur 'd the right and straight way ; My Sword 's in my hand now Nephew , my cause upon it , And man to man , one valour to another , My hope to his .
Why ? this is like Ruy Dias ? This carries something of some substance in it ; Some mettle and some man , this sounds a Gentleman ; And now methinks ye utter what becomes ye ; To kill men scurvily , 't is such a dog-trick , Such a Rat-catchers occupation --
It is no better , But Pyniero , now --
Now you do bravely .
The difference of our States flung by , forgotten , The full opinion I have won in service , And such respects that may not shew us equal , Laid handsomly aside , only our fortunes , And single manhoods --
In a service , Sir , Of this most noble nature , all I am , If I had ten lives more , those and my fortunesAre ready for ye , I had thought ye had forsworn fighting , Or banish 'd those brave thoughts were wont to wait upon you ; I am glad to see 'em call 'd home agen .
They are Nephew , And thou shalt see what fire they carry in them , Here , you guess what this means. [ Shews a challenge .
Yes very well , Sir , A portion of Scripture that puzles many an interpreter .
As soon as you can find him --
That will not be long Uncle , And o ' my conscience he 'll be ready as quickly .
I make no doubt good Nephew , carry it soIf you can possible , that we may fight .
Nay you shall fight , assure your self .
Pray ye hear meIn some such place where it may be possibleThe Princess may behold us .
I conceive ye , Upon the sand behind the Castle , Sir , A place remote enough , and there be windowsOut of her Lodgings too , or I am mistaken .
Y'are i'th ' right , if ye can work that handsomly --
Let me alone , and pray be you prepar'dSome three hours hence .
I will not fail .
Get you home , And if you have any things to dispose of , Or a few light prayersThat may befriend you , run 'em over quickly , I warrant I 'll bring him on .
Farewel Nephew , And when we meet again --
I , I , fight handsomly ; Take a good draught or two of Wine to settle ye , Tis an excellent armour for an ill conscience , Uncle ; I am glad to see this mans conversion , I was afraid fair honor had been bed-rid , Or beaten out o ' th ' Island , soldiers , and good ones , Intended such base courses ? he will fight now ; And I believe too bravely ; I have seen himCurry a fellows carkasse handsomely : And in the head of a troop , stand as if he had been rooted there , Dealing large doles of death ; what a rascal was II did not see his Will drawn ! What does she here ?
Quisara.If there be any mischief towards , a woman makes one still ; Now what new business is for me ?
I was sending for ye , But since we have met so fair , You have say 'd that labour ; I must intreat you , Sir --
Any thing Madam , Your Wils are my Commands .
Y'are nobly courteous ; Upon my better thoughts Signior Pyniero , And my more peaceable considerations , Which now I find the richer ornaments ; I wou 'd desire you to attempt no fartherAgainst the person of the noble stranger , In truth I am asham 'd of my share i n't ; Nor be incited farther by your Uncle , I see it will sit ill upon your person ; I have considered , and it will shew ugly , Carried at best , a most unheard of cruelty ; Good Sir desist --
You speak now like a woman , And wondrous well this tenderness becomes ye ; But this you must remember -- your commandWas laid on with a kiss , and seriouslyIt must be taken off the same way , Madam , Or I stand bound still .
That shall not endanger ye , Look ye fair Sir , thus I take off that duty .
By th ' mass 't was soft and sweet , Some bloods would bound now , And run a tilt ; do not you think bright beauty ; You have done me in this kiss , a mighty favour , And that [ I stand ] bound by virtue of this honor , To do what ever you command me ?
I think Sir , From me these are unusual courtesies , And ought to be respected so ; there are some , And men of no mean rank , would hold themselvesNot poorly blest to taste of such a bounty .
I know there are , that wou 'd do many unjust thingsFor such a kiss , and yet I hold this modest ; All villanies , body and soul dispense with , For such a provocation , kill their kindred , Demolish the fair credits of their Parents ; Those kisses I am not acquainted with , most certain Madam , The appurtenance of this kiss wou 'd not provoke meTo do a mischief , 't is the devils own dance , To be kiss 'd into cruelty .
I am glad you make that use Sir .
I am gladderThat you made me believe you were cruel , For by this hand , I know I am so honest , However I deceiv 'd ye , 't was high time too , Some common slave might have been set upon it else ; That willingly I wou 'd not kill a dogThat could but fetch and carry for a woman , She must be a good woman made me kick him , And that will be hard to find , to kill a man , If you will give me leave to get another , Or any she that plaid the best game at it , And 'fore a womans anger , prefer her fancy .
I take it in you well .
I thank ye Lady , And I shall study to confirm it .
Do Sir , For this time , and this present cause , I allow it , Most holy Sir .
, Quisana , and Panura .
Bless ye my Royal Daughter , And in you , bless this Island Heaven .
Good Aunt , What think ye of this man ?
Sure h ' is a wise man , And a Religious , he tells us things have hapenedSo many years ago , almost forgotten , As readily as if they were done this hour .
Does he not meet with your sharp tongue ?
He tells me Madam , Marriage , and mouldy Cheese will make me tamer .
A stubborn keeper , and worse fare , An open stable , and cold care , Will tame a Jade , may be your share .
Bir Lady , a sharp prophet , when this proves good , I 'll bequeath you a skin to make ye a Hood .
Lady , I would talk with you .
Do reverend Sir .
And for your good , for that that must concern ye , And give ear wisely to me .
I shall father .
You are a Princess of that excellence , Sweetness , and grace , that Angel-like fair feature , Nay , do not blush , I do not flatter you , Nor do I dote in telling this , I am amazed Lady , And as I think the gods bestow 'd these on ye , The gods that love ye .
I confess their bounty .
Apply it then to their use , to their honor , To them , and to their service give this sweetness ; They have an instant great use of your goodness ; You are a Saint esteem 'd here for your beauty , And many a longing heart --
I seek no fealty , Nor will I blemish that , heaven has seal 'd on me , I know my worth , indeed the PortugalsI have at those commands , and their last services , Nay , even their lives , so much I think my handsomness , That what I shall enjoyn --
Use it discreetly.For I perceive ye understand me rightly , For here the gods regard your help , and suddainly ; The Portugals , like sharp thorns ( mark me Lady ) Stick in our sides , like Razors , wound Religion , Draw deep , they wound , till the Life-bloud follows , Our gods they spurn at , and their worships scorn , A mighty hand they bear upon our government , These are the men your miracle must work on , Your heavenly form , either to root them out , Which as you may endeavour will be easie , Remember whose great cause you have to execute , To nip their memory , that may not spring more , Or fairly bring 'em home to our devotions , Which will be blessed , and for which you sainted , But can not be , and they go ; let me buzle .
Go up with me , Where we 'll converse more privately ; I 'll shew ye shortly how I hold their temper ; And in what chain thir souls .
Keep fast that hold still , And either bring that chain , and those bound in it , And link it to our gods , and their fair worships.Or Daughter , pinch their hearts apieces with it , I 'll wait upon your grace .
Come reverend father.Wait you below. [ Ex. Quisar. and Gov .

I am sorry , Sir , my fortune is so stubborn , To court my sword against my Countreyman ; I love my Nation well , and where I findA Portugal of noble Name and Virtue , I am his humble servant , Signior Pyniero , Your person , nor your Uncles am I angry with , You are both fair Gentlemen in my opinion , And I protest , I had rather use my swordIn your defences , than against your safeties ; 'T is methinks a strange dearth of enemies , When we seek foes among our selves .
You are injured , And you must make the best o n't now , and readiest --
You see I am ready in the place , and arm'dTo his desire that call 'd me .
Ye speak honestly , And I could wish ye had met on terms more friendly , But it can not now be so .
Ruy Dias .
Turn Sir , and see .
I have kept my word with ye Uncle , The Gentleman is ready .
Quisara above .
Ye are welcome .
Bid those fools welcome , that affect your courtesie , I come not to use compliment , ye have wrong 'd me , And ye shall feel , proud man , e'r I part from ye , The effects of that , if fortune do not fool me ; Thy life is mine , and no hope shall redeem thee .
That 's a proud word , More than your faith can justifie .
Sure they will fight .
She 's there , I am happy .
Let 'em alone , let 'em kill one another , These are the main posts , if they fall , the buildingsWill tumble quickly .
How temperate Armusia ! No more , be quiet yet .
I am not bloody , Nor do not feel such mortal malice in me , But since we can not both enjoy the Princess , I am resolv 'd to fight .
Fight home Armusia , For if thou faint'st , or fall'st --
Do ye make all vantages ?
Always ; unto thy life I will not spare thee , Nor look not for thy mercy .
I am arm 'd then .
Stand still I charge ye Nephew , as ye honor me .
And good Emanuel stir not --
Ye speak fitly , For we had not stood idle else .
I am sorry for't .
But since you will have it so --
Come Sir .
I wait ye .
I marry , this looks handsomely , This is warm work .
Both fall and't be thy Will. [ Ruy falls .
My Uncle dead ?
Stand still , or my swords in --
Now brave Ruy Dias , Now where 's your confidence , your prayers ? quicklyYour own spite has condemn 'd ye .
Hold Armusia .
Most happy Lady .
Hold , and let him rise , Spare him for me .
A long life may he enjoy , Lady .
What ha you done ? 't is better they had all perisht .
Peace father , I work for the best ; Armusia , Be in the Garden an hour hence. [ Ex. Qu. and Gov .
I shall Madam .
Now as I live , a Gentleman at all inches , So brave a mingled temper saw I never .
Why are ye sad Sir ? how would this have griev 'd you , If ye had fall'n under a profest enemy ? Under one had taken vantage of your shame too ? Pray ye be at peace , I am so far from wronging ye , Or glorying in the pride of such a victory , That I desire to serve ye , pray look chearfully .
Do you hear this Sir ? this love Sir ? do you see this GentlemanHow he courts ye ? why do you hold your head down ? 'T is no high Treason , I take it , to be equall 'd ; To have a slip i ' th field , no sin , that 's mortal ; Come , come , thank fortune and your friend .
It may beYou think my tongue may prove your enemy ; And though restrain 'd sometimes , out of a bravery , May take a License to disable ye : Believe me Sir , so much I hate that liberty , That in a strangers tongue , 'twill prove an injury , And I shall right you i n't .
Can you have more , Uncle ?
Sir , you have beat me both ways , yet so nobly , That I shall ever love the hand that did it : Fortune may make me worthy of some titleThat may be near your friend,
Sir , I must leave ye , But with so hearty love ; and pray be confident , I carry nothing from this place shall wrong ye. [ Exit Arm. and Em .
Come , come , you are right agen , Sir , love your honor , And love your friend , take heed of bloody purposes , And unjust ends , good heaven is angry with ye ; Make your fair virtues , and your fame your Mistriss , And let these trinkets go .
You teach well Nephew , Now to be honourabl [ e ] even with this Gentleman , Shall be my business , and my ends his .
Sir , Sir , you must do something suddainly , To stop his pride so great and high , he is shot up , Upon his person too , your state is sunk else : You must not stand now upon terms of gratitude , And let a simple tenderness besot ye : I 'll bring ye suddenly where you shall see him , Attempting your brave Sister , privately , Mark but his high behaviour then .
I will Father .
And with scorn , I fear contempt too .
I hope not .
I will not name a lust ; It may be that also ; A little force must be applyed upon him , Now , now applyed , a little force to humble him.These sweet intreaties do but make him wanton .
Take heed ye wrong him not .
Take heed to your safety , I but forewarn ye King ; if you mistrust me , Or think I come un-sent --
No , I 'll go with you. [ Exeunt .
Armusia , Quisara .
Madam , you see there 's nothing I can reach at , Either in my obedience , or my service , That may deserve your love , or win a liking , But a poor thought , but I pursue it seriously , Take pleasure in your Will , even in your anger , Which other men would grudge at , and grow stormy ; I study new humility to please ye , And take a kind of joy in my afflictions , Because they come from ye , I love my sorrows : Pray Madam but consider --
Yes , I do Sir , And to that honest end I drew thee hither ; I know ye have deserv 'd as much as man can , And know it is a justice to requite you : I know ye love .
If ever love was mortal , And dwelt in man , and for that love command me , So strong I find it , and so true , here Lady , Something of such a greatness to allow me , Those things I have done already , may seem foyls too : 'T is equity that man aspires to heaven , Should win it by his worth , and not sleep to it .
Now stand close King and hear , and as you find him , Believe me right , or let Religion suffer .
I dare believe your worth without additions ; But since you are so liberal of your love Sir , And wou 'd be farther tried , I do intend it , Because you shall not , or you wou 'd not win meAt such an easie rate .
I am prepared still , And if I shrink --
I know ye are no coward , This is the utmost trial of your constancy , And if you stand fast now , I am yours , your wife Sir ; You hold there 's nothing dear that may atchieve me , Doubted or dangerous .
There 's nothing , nothing : Let me but know , that I may straight flie to it .
I 'll tell you then , change your Religion.And be of one belief with me .
How ?
Mark , Worship our Gods , renounce that faith ye are bred in ; 'T is easily done , I 'll teach ye suddenly ; And humbly on your knees --
Ha ? I 'll be hang 'd first .
Offer as we do .
To the devil Lady ? Offer to him I hate ? I know the devil.To dogs and cats ? you make offer to them ; To every bird that flies , and every worm.How terribly I shake ! Is this the venture ? The trial that you talk 'd of ? where have I been ? And how forgot my self ? how lost my memory ? When did I pray , or look up stedfastly ? Had any goodness in my heart to guide me ? That I should give this vantage to mine enemy ; The enemy to my peace , forsake my faith ?
Come , come , I know ye love me .
Love ye this way ? This most destroying way ? sure you but jest , Lady .
My Love and Life are one way .
Love alone then , and mine another way , I 'll love diseases first , Doat on a villain that would cut my throat , Wooe all afflictions of all sorts , kiss cruelty.Have mercy heaven , how have I been wand'ring ! Wand'ring the way of Lust , and left my Maker ! How have I slept like Cork upon a water , And had no feeling of the storm that tost me ! Trode the blind paths of death ! forsook assurance , Eternity of blessedness for a woman ! For a young handsome face , hazard my Being !
Are not our powers eternal , so their comforts ? As great and full of hopes as yours ?
They are puppets .
Now mark him Sir , and but observe him nearly .
Their comforts like themselves , cold , sensless outsides ; You make 'em sick , as we are , peevish , mad , Subject to age ; and how can they cure us , That are not able to refine themselves ?
The Sun and Moon we worship , those are heavenly , And their bright influences we believe .
Now you may see .
Take heed , you goe too far , Sir , And yet I love to hear him , I must have ye , And to that end I let you storm a little ; I know there must be some strife in your bosomTo cool and quiet ye , e'r you can come back : I know old friends can not part suddainly , There will be some left still , yet I must have ye , Have ye of my faith too , and so enjoy ye .
Now I contemn ye , and I hate my selfFor looking on that face lasciviously , And it looks ugly now me thinks .
How Portugal ?
It looks like death it self , to which 'twou 'd lead me ; Your eyes resemble pale dispair , they fright me , And in their rounds , a thousand horrid ruins , Methinks I see ; and in your tongue hear fearfullyThe hideous murmurs of weak souls have suffer 'd ; Get from me , I despise ye ; and know woman , That for all this trap you have laid to catch my life in , To catch my immortal life , I hate and curse ye , Contemn your Deities , spurn at their powers , And where I meet your Mahumet gods , I 'll swing 'emThus o'r my head , and kick 'em into puddles , Nay , I will out of vengeance search your Temples.And with those hearts that serve my God , demolishYour shambles of wild worships .
Now , now you hear Sir .
I will have my faith , since you are so crafty , The glorious cross , although I love your brother ; Let him frown too , I will have my devotion , And let your whole State storm .
Enter and take him ; I am sorry friend that I am forc 'd to do this .
Be sure you bind him fast .
But use him nobly .
Had it to me been done , I had forgiven it , And still preserv 'd you fair , but to our gods Sir --
Methinks I hate 'em now .
To our Religion , To these to be thus stubborn , thus rebelliousTo threaten them .
Use all your violence , I ask no mercy , nor repent my words : I spit at your best powers ; I serve one , Will give me strength to scourge your gods .
Away with him .
To grind 'em into base dust , and disperse 'em , That never more their bloudy memories --
Clap him close up .
Good friend be cooler .
Never ; Your painted Sister I despise too .
Softly .
And all her devilish Arts laugh and scorn at , Mock her blind purposes .
You must be temperate ; Offer him no violence , I command you strictly .
Now thou art up , I shall have time to speak too .
Oh how I love this man , how truly honor him. [ Exeunt .
Christophero , and Pedro ( at one door ) Emanuel , andSoza , ( at another ) .
Do you know the news Gentlemen ?
Wou 'd we knew as well , Sir , How to prevent it .
Is this the love they bear us , For our late benefit ? taken so maliciously , And clapt up close ? is that the thanks they render ?
It must not be put up thus , smother 'd slightly , 'T is such a base unnatural wrong .
I know , They may think to doe wonders , aim at all , And to blow us with a vengeance , out o'th ' Islands : But if we be our selves , honest and resolute , And continue but Masters of our antient courages , Stick close , and give no vantage to their villanies --
Nay , if we faint or fall apieces now , We are fools , and worthy to be markt for misery ; Begin to strike at him , they are all bound too ? To cancel his deserts ? what must we look forIf they can carry this ?
I 'll carry coals then ; I have but one life , and one fortune , Gentlemen , But I 'll so husband it to vex these rascals , These barbarous slaves .
Shall we go charge 'em presently ?
No , that will be too weak , and too fool-hardy , We must have grounds , that promise safety , friends , And sure offence , we lose our angers else , And worse than that , venture our lives too lightly .
Pyniero .
Did you see mine Uncle ? plague o ' these Barbarians , How the rogues stick in my teeth , I know ye are angry , So I am too , monstrous angry , Gentlemen , I am angry , that I choak agen.You hear Armusia 's up , honest Arm : Clapt up in prison , friends , the brave Arm : Here are fine boys .
We hope he shall not stay there .
Stay , no , he must not stay , no talk of staying , These are no times to stay ; are not these rascals ? Speak , I beseech ye speak , are they not Rogues ? Think some abominable names -- are they not devils ? But the devil 's a great deal too good for 'em -- fusty villains .
They are a kind of hounds .
Hounds were their fathers ; Old blear-ey 'd bob-tail 'd hounds -- Lord , where 's my Uncle ?
But what shall be done , Sir ?
Done ?
Yes , to relieve him ; If it be not sudden they may take his life too .
They dare as soon take fire and swallow it , Take stakes and thrust into their tails for glisters : His life , why 't is a thing worth all the Islands , And they know will be rated at that value ; His very imprisonment will make the Town stink , And shake and stink , I have physick in my hand for 'emShall give the goblins such a purge --
Ruy Dias .
Your Uncle .
I hear strange news , and have been seeking ye ; They say Armusia 's prisoner .
'T is most certain .
Upon what cause ?
He has deserv 'd too much , Sir ; The old heathen policie has light upon him.And paid him home .
A most unnoble dealing .
You are the next , if you can carry it tamely , He has deserved of all .
I must confess it , Of me so nobly too .
I am glad to hear it , You have a time now to make good your confession , Your faith will shew but cold else , and for fashion , Now to redeem all , now to thank his courtesie , Now to make those believe that held you backward , And an ill instrument , you are a Gentleman , An honest man , and you dare love your Natio [ n ] , Dare stick to virtue , though she be opprest , And for her own fair sake , step to her rescue : If you live ages , Sir , and lose this hour , Not now redeem , and vindicate your honorYour life will be a murmure , and no man i n't .
I thank ye nephew , come along with me Gentlemen , We 'll make 'em dancing sport immediately : We are Masters of the Fort yet , we shall seeWhat that can do .
Let it but spit fire finely , And play their turrets , and their painted Palaces , A frisking round or two , that they may trip it ; And caper in the air .
Come , we 'll do somethingShall make 'em look about , we 'll send 'em plums , If they be not too hard for their teeth .
And fine PotatoesRosted in Gunpowder , such a Banquet , SirWill prepare their unmannerly stomachs .
They shall seeThere is no safe retreat in villany ; Come , be high-hearted all .
We are all on fire , Sir. [ Exeunt .
I am ungrateful , and a wretch , perswade me not , Forgetful of the mercy he shew 'd me , The timely noble pity -- why should ISee him fast bound and fetter 'd , whose true courtesie , Whose manhood , and whose mighty hand set me free ? Why should it come from me ? why I command this ? Shall not all tongues and truths call me unthankful ?
Had the offence been thrown on you , 't is certainIt had been in your power , and your discretionTo have turn 'd it into mercy , and forgiven it , And then it had shew 'd a virtuous point of gratitude , Timely , and nobly taken ; but since the causeConcerns the honor of our gods , and their Title , And so transcends your power , and your compassion , A little your own safety , if you saw it too , If your too fond indulgence did not dazle you , It can not now admit a private pitty ; 'T is in their Wills , their Mercies , or Revenges , And these revolts in you , shew mere rebellions .
They are mild and pittiful .
To those repent .
Their nature 's soft and tender .
To true hearts.That feel compunction for their trespasses : This man defies 'em still , threatens destructionAnd demolition of their Arms and Worship , Spits at their powers ; take heed ye be not found , Sir , And mark 'd a favourer of their dishonor ; They use no common justice .
What shall I doTo deserve of this man --
If ye more bemoan him , Or mitigate your power to preserve him , I 'll curse ye from the gods , call up their vengeance .
Quisara with her hands bound , Quisana , Panura.And fling it on your Land and you , I have charge [ for't ; ] I hope to wrack you all .
What ails my Sister ? Why , is she bound ? why looks she so distractedly ? Who does do this ?
We did it , pardon Sir , And for her preservation -- She is grown wild , And raving on the strangers love and honor , Sometimes crying out help , help , they will torture him , They will take his life , they will murder him presently , If we had not prevented violentlyHave laid hands on her own life .
These are tokens , The gods displeasure is gone out , be quick , And e'r it fall , doe something to appease 'em.You know the sacrifice -- I am glad it works thus .
How low and base thou lookst now , that wert noble ! No figure of a King , methinks shews on you.No face of Majesty , foul , swarth ingratitudeHas taken off thy sweetness , base forgetfulnessOf mighty benefits , has turned thee Devil : Thou hast persecuted goodness , innocence ; And laid a hard and violent hand on virtue , On that fair virtue that should teach and guide us ; Thou hast wrong 'd thine own preserver , whose least merit , Pois 'd with thy main Estate , thou canst not satisfie , Nay , put thy life in too , 'twill be too light still : What hast thou done ?
Goe for him presently , And once more we 'll try if we can win him fairly : If not , let nothing she says hinder ye , or stir ye ; She speaks distractedly -- Do that the gods command ye , Do you know what ye say Lady ?
I could curse thee too , Religion and severity has steel 'd thee , Has turn 'd thy heart to stone ; thou hast made the gods hard too , Against their sweet and patient natures , cruel : None of ye feel what bravery ye tread on ? What innocence ? what beauty ?
Pray be patient .
What honourable things ye cast behind [ ye ] ? What monuments of man ?
Armusia and Guard .
Once more Armusia , Because I love ye tenderly and dearly , And would be glad to win ye mine , I wish ye , Even from my heart I wish and wooe ye --
What Sir , Take heed how ye perswade me falsly , then ye hate me : Take heed how ye intrap me .
I advise ye , And tenderly and truly I advise ye , Both for your souls health , and your safety .
Stay , And name my soul no more , she is too precious , Too glorious for you [ r ] flatteries , too secure too .
Consider the reward , Sir , and the honorThat is prepared , the glory you shall grow to .
They are not to be consider 'd in these cases , Not to be nam 'd when souls are question 'd ; They are vain and flying vapors -- touch my life , 'T is ready for ye , put it to what testIt shall please ye , I am patient ; but for the restYou may remove Rocks with your little fingers , Or blow a Mountain out o ' th ' way , with bellows , As soon as stir my faith ; use no more arguments .
We must use tortures then .
Your worst and painfull'stI am joyful to accept .
You must the sharpest , For such has been your hate against our DeitiesDelivered openly , your threats and scornings , And either your repentance must be mighty , Which is your free conversion to our customs , Or equal punishment which is your life , Sir .
I am glad I have it for ye , take it Priest , And all the miseries that shall attend it : Let the gods glut themselves with Christian bloud , It will be ask 'd again , and so far followed , So far reveng 'd , and with such holy justice , Your gods of gold shall melt and sink before it ; Your Altars and your Temples shake to nothing ; And you false worshipers , blind fools of ceremony , Shall seek for holes to hide your heads , and fears in , For seas to swallow you from this destruction , Darkness to dwell about ye , and conceal ye ; Your mothers womb agen --
Make the fires ready , And bring the several tortures out .
Stand fast , Sir , And fear 'em not , you that have stept so noblyInto this pious Trial , start not now , Keep on your way , a Virgin will assist ye , A Virgin won by your fair constancy , And glorying that she is won so , will dye by ye : I have touch 'd ye every way , tried ye most honest , Perfect , and good , chaste , blushing chaste , and temperate , Valiant , without vain-glory , modest , stayed , No rage , or light affection ruling in you : Indeed , the perfect school of worth I find ye , The temple of true honor .
Whether will she ? What do you infer by this fair argument , Lady ?
Your Faith , and your Religion must be like ye , They that can shew you these , must be pure mirrors , When the streams flow clear and fair , what are the fountains ? I do embrace your faith , Sir , and your fortune ; Go on , I will assist ye , I feel a sparkle here , A lively spark that kindles my affection , And tells me it will rise to flames of glory : Let 'em put on their angers , suffer nobly , Shew me the way , and when I faint , instruct me ; And if I follow not --
Oh blessed Lady , Since thou art won , let me begin my triumph , Come clap your terrors on .
All your fell tortures.For there is nothing he shall suffer , brother , I swear by a new faith , which is most sacred , And I will keep it so , but I will follow in , And follow to a scruple of affliction , In spight of all your gods without prevention .
Death ! she amazes me .
What shall be done now ?
They must dye both , And suddenly , they will corrupt all else ; This woman makes me weary of my mischief , She shakes me , and she staggers me , go in Sir , I 'll see the execution .
Not so suddain : If they go , all my Friends and Sisters perish .
Wou 'd I were safe at home agen .
Arm , arm , Sir , Seek for defence , the Castle plays and thunders , The Town Rocks , and the houses fly i ' th ' air , The people dye for fear -- Captain Ruy Dias , Has made an oath he will not leave a stone here ; No , not the memory , here has stood a City , Unless Armusia be deliver 'd fairly .
I have my fears : what can our gods do now for us ?
Be patient , but keep him still : he is a cure , Sir , Against both Rage and Cannon : goe and fortifie , Call in the Princess , make the Palace sure , And let 'em know you are a King : look nobly ; And take you [ r ] courage to ye ; keep close the prisoner , And under command , we are betraid else .
How joyfully I goe !
Take my heart with thee .
I hold a Wolf by the ear now : Fortune free me. [ Exeunt .
Heaven bless us , What a thund'ring 's here ! what fire-spitting ! We can not drink , but our Cans are mauld amongst us .
I wou 'd they would mall our scores too : Shame o ' their Guns , I thought they had been bird-pots , Or great Candle-cases , how devilishly they bounce , And how the Bullets borrow a piece of a house here , There another , and mend those up agenWith another Parish ; here flies a poudring-tub , The meat ready rosted , and there a barrel pissing vinegar , And they two over-taking the top of a high Steeple , Newly slic 'd off for a Sallet .
A vengeance fire 'em .
Nay , they fire fast enough ; You need not help 'em .
Are these the Portugal Bulls -- How loud they bellow !
Their horns are plaguy strong , they push down PalacesThey toss our little habitations like whelps , Like grindle-tails , with their heels upward ; All the windows i'th Town dance a new Trenchmore , 'T is like to prove a blessed age for Glasiers , I met a hand , and a Letter i n't , in great haste , And by and by , a single leg running after it , As if the arm had forgot part of his errand , Heads flie like Foot-balls every where .
What shall we do ?
I care not , my shop 's cancell 'd , And all the Pots , and earthen Pans i n't vanish't : There was a single Bullet , and they together by the ears ; You would have thought Tom Tumbler had been there , And all his troop of devils .
Let 's to the King , And get this Gentleman deliver 'd handsomly : By this hand , there 's no walking above ground else .
By this leg -- let me swear nimbly by it , For I know not how long I shall owe it , If I were out o'th ' Town once , if I came in agen toFetch my breakfast , I will give 'em leave to cramm meWith a Portugal Pudding : Come ; let 's doe any thingTo appease this thunder. [ Exeunt .
Pyniero and Panura .
Art sure it was that blind Priest ?
Yes most certain , He has provok 'd all this ; the King is merciful , And wond'rous loving ; but he fires him on still , And when he cools , enrages him , I know it : Threatens new vengeance , and the gods fierce justiceWhen he but looks with fair eyes on Armusia , Will lend him no time to relent ; my royal Mistriss , She has entertain 'd a Christian hope .
Speak truly .
Nay , 't is most true , but Lord ! how he lies at her , And threatens her , and flatters her , and damns her , And I fear , if not speedily prevented , If she continue stout , both shall be executed,
I 'll kiss thee for this news , nay more Panura , If thou wilt give me leave I 'll get thee with Christian , The best way to convert thee .
Make me believe so ?
I will y'faith. But which way cam'st thou hither ? The Pallace is close guarded , and barricado 'd .
I came through a private vault , which few there know of ; It rises in a Temple not far hence , Close by the Castle here .
How -- To what end ?
A good one : To give ye knowledge of my new-born Mistriss ; And in what doubt Armusia stands , Think any present means , or hope to stop 'emFrom their fell ends : the Princes are come in too , And they are harden 'd also .
The damn 'd Priest --
Sure he 's a cruel man , methinks ReligionShould teach more temperate Lessons .
He the fire-brand ? He dare to touch at such fair lives as theirs are ? Well Prophet , I shall prophesie , I shall catch ye , When all your Prophecies will not redeem ye ? Wilt thou do one thing bravely ?
Any good I am able .
And by thine own white hand , I 'll swear thou art virtuous , And a brave wench , durst thou but guide me presently , Through the same vault thou cam'st , into the PallaceAnd those I shall appoint , such as I think fit .
Yes I will do it , and suddainly , and truly .
I wou 'd fain behold this Prophet .
Now I have ye : And shall bring ye where ye shall behold him , Alone too , and unfurnish 'd of defences : That shall be my care ; but you must not betray me .
Dost thou think we are so base , such slaves , rogues ?
I do not : And you shall see how fairly I 'll work for ye .
I must needs steal that Priest , Steal him , and hang him .
Do any thing to remove his mischief , strangle him --
Come prethee love .
You 'll offer me no foul play ? The Vault is dark .
'T was well remember 'd .
And ye may -- But I hold ye honest .
Honest enough I warrant thee .
I am but a poor weak wench ; and what with the place , And your perswasions Sir -- but I hope you will not ; You know we are often cozen 'd .
If thou dost fear me , Why dost thou put me in mind ?
To let you know Sir , Though it be in your power , and things fitting to it , Yet a true Gent --
I know what he 'll do : Come and remember me , and I 'll answer thee , I 'll answer thee to the full ; we 'll call at th ' Castle , And then my good guide , do thy Will ; sha't find meA very tractable man !
I hope I shall Sir. [ Exeunt .
Bakam , Syana , and Soldiers .
Let my men guard the Gates .
And mine the Temple , For fear the honor of our gods should suffer , And on your lives be watchful .
And be valiant ; And let 's see , if these Portugals dare enter ; What their high hearts dare do : Let 's see how readily , The great Ruy Dias will redeem his Countrey-men ; He speaks proud words , and threatens .
He is approv 'd , Sir , And will put fair for what he promises ; I could wish friendlier terms , Yet for our liberties and for our gods , We are bound in our best serviceEven in the hazard of our lives .
Come up Princes , And give your counsels , and your helps : the Fort stillPlays fearfully upon us , beats our buildings , And turns our people wild with fears .
Send for the prisoner , And give us leave to argue. [ Exit Ba. and Sy. then,
Ruy Dias , Emanuel , Christoph. Pedro , with Sold .
Come on nobly , And let the Fort play still , we areStrong enough to look upon 'em , And return at pleasure ; it mayBe on our view they will return him .
We will return 'em such thanks else , Shall make 'em scratch where it itches not .
How the people stare , And some cry , some pray , and some curse heartily : But it is the King --
Syana , Bakam , Quisara , Armusia , with Soldiers above .
I can not blame their wisdoms.They are all above , Armusia chain 'd and bound too ? Oh , these are tha [ n ] kful Squires .
Hear us Ruy Di [ a ] s , Be wise and hear us , and give speedy answer , Command thy Cannon presently to cease , No more to trouble the afflicted people , Or suddainly Armusia 's head goes off ; As suddainly as said .
Stay Sir , be moderate .
Do nothing that 's dishonourable Ruy DyasLet not the fear of me , master thy valour ; Pursue 'em still , they are base malicious people .
Friend , be not desperate .
I scorn your courtesies ; Strike when you dare , a fair arm guide the GunnerAnd may he let flie still with fortune : friend , Do me the honor of a Soldiers funerals , The last fair Christian right , see me i'th ' ground , And let the Palace burn first , then the Temples , And on their scorn 'd gods , erect my monument : Touch not the Princess , as you are a Soldier .
Which way you goe , Sir , I must follow necessary.One life , and one death .
Will you take a truce yet ?
Pyniero , Soza , and Soldiers , with the Governor .
No , no , go on : Look here , your god , your prophet .
How came he taken ?
I conjur 'd for him , King.I am a sure Curr at an old blind Prophet.I 'll haunt ye such a false knave admirably , A terrier I ; I eartht him , and then snapt him .
Saving the reverence of your grace , we stole him , E'en out of the next chamber to ye .
Come , come , begin King , Begin this bloudy matter when you dare ; And yet I scorn my sword should touch the rascal , I 'll tear him thus before ye. Ha ? What art thou ? { Pulls his Beard and hair off .
How 's this ! Art thou a Prophet ?
Come down Princes .
We are abus 'd -- Oh my most dear Armusia -- Off with his chains. And now my noble Sister , Rejoyce with me , I know ye are pleas 'd as I am .
This is a precious Prophet. Why Don Governor , What make you here , how long have you taken Orders ?
Why what a wretchArt thou to work this mischief ? To assume this holy shape to ruine honor , Honor and chastity ?
I had paid you all , But fortune plaid the slut. Come , Give me my doom .
I can not speak for wonder .
Nay , 't is I Sir , And here I stay your sentence .
Take her friend , You have half perswaded me to be a Christian , And with her all the joyes , and all the blessings.Why what dream have we dwelt in ?
All peace to ye , And all the happiness of heart dwell with ye , Children as sweet and noble as their Parents .
And Kings at least .
Good Sir , forget my rashness.And noble Princess [ e ] , for I was once angry , And out of that , might utter some distemper , Think not 't is my nature .
Your joy is ours , Sir.And nothing we find in ye , but most noble .
To prison with this dog , there let him houl , And if he can repent , sigh out his villanies : His Island we shall seize into our hands , His Father and himself have both usurp 'd it , And kept it by oppression ; the Town and Castle , In which I lay my self most miserable , Till my most honourable friend redeem 'd me , Signior Pyniero , I bestow on you , The rest of next command upon these Gentlemen , Upon ye , all my love .
Oh brave Ruy Dias , You have started now beyond me. I must thank ye , And thank ye for my life , my wife and honor .
I am glad I had her for you , Sir .
Jaques .
What happiness waits on the life at Court , What dear content , greatness , delight and ease ! What ever-springing hopes , what tides of honor ! That raise their fortunes to the height of wishes ! What can be more in man , what more in nature , Than to be great and fear 'd ? A Courtier , A noble Courtier , 'T is a name that drawsWonder and duty from all eyes and knees .
And so your Worships Land within the Walls , Where you shall have it all inclos 'd , and sure .
Peace knave ; dull creature , bred of sweat and smoke , These mysteries are far above thy faith : But thou shalt see --
And then I shall believe ; Your fair revenues , turn 'd into fair suits ; I shall believe your Tenant 's bruis 'd and rentUnder the weight of Coaches , all your stateDrawn through the streets in triumph , suits for placesPlied with a Mine of Gold , and being gotFed with a great stream. I shall believe all this .
You shall believe , and know me glorious.Cosin , good day and health .
The same to you , Sir , And more , without my wishes , could you knowWhat calm content dwels in a private house : Yet look into your self , retire : this placeOf promises , and protestations , fitsMinds only bent [ t ] o ruin , you should know this , You have their language perfect , you have tutorsI do not doubt , sufficient : but beware .
You are merry Cosin:
Yet your patience , You shall learn that too , but not like it self , Where it is held a virtue ; tell me Sir , Have you cast up your State , rated your Land , And find it able to endure the changeOf time and fashion ? is it always harvest ? Always vintage ? have you Ships at Sea , To bring you Gold and Stone from rich Peru , Monthly returning Treasure ? doth the KingOpen his large Exchequer to your handsAnd bid ye be a great man ? can your wifeCoin off her beauty ? or the week allowSuits to each day ? and know no ebb in honor ? If these be possible , and can hold out , Then be a Courtier still , and still be wasting .
Cosin , pray give me leave:
I have done .
I could requite your gall , and in a strainAs bitter , and as full of Rubarb , preachAgainst your Countrey life , but 't is below meAnd only subject to my pitty , knowThe eminent Court , to them that can be wise , And fasten on her blessings , is a SunThat draws men up from course and earthly Being , I mean these men of merit that have powerAnd reason to make good her benefits , Learns them a manly boldness , gives their tonguesSweetness of Language , makes them apt to please ; Files of all rudeness , and uncivil haviour , Shews them as neat in carriage , as in cloaths ; Cosin , have you ever seen the Court ?
No Sir , Nor am I yet in travel with that longing .
Oh the state and greatness of that placeWhere men are foundOnly to give the first creation glory ! Those are the models of the antient worldLeft like the Roman Statues to stir upOur following hopes , the place it self puts onThe brow of Majesty , and flings her lustreLike the air newly light'ned ; Form , and Order , Are only there themselves , unforc 'd , and sound , As they were first created to this place .
You nobly came , but will goe from thence base .
'T was very pretty , and a good conceit ; You have a wit good Cosin , I do joy i n't , Keep it for Court : but to my self again , When I have view 'd these pieces , turn 'd these eyes , And with some taste of superstition , Look 'd on the wealth of Nature , the fair dames , Beauties , that light the Court , and make it shewLike a fair heaven , in a frosty night : And 'mongst these mine , not poorest , 't is for tonguesOf blessed Poets , such as Orpheus was , To give their worth and praises ; Oh dear Cosin : You have a wife , and fair , bring her hither , Let her not live to be the Mistriss of a Farmers heirAnd be confin 'd ever to a searge , Far courser than my horse-cloth.Let her have Velvets , Tiffinies , Jewels , Pearls , A Coach , an Usher , and her two Lacquies , And I will send my wife to give her rules , And read the rudiments of Court to her .
Sir , I had rather send her to VirginiaTo help to propagate the English Nation .
Sirrah , how slept your Mistriss , and what visitantsAre to pay service ?
As I came out , Two Counts were newly ent'red .
This is greatness , But few such servants wait a Countrey beauty .
They are the more to thank their modesty , God keep my Wife , and all my Issue FemaleFrom such uprisings .
What ? my learned Doctor ? You will be welcome , give her health and youthAnd I will give you gold. [ Exit Doctor.Cosin , how savors this ? is it not sweetAnd very great , tasts it not of Nobleness ?
Faith Sir , my pallat is too dull and lazieI can not taste it , 't is not for my relish , But be so still.Since your own misery must first reclaim ye , To which I leave you , Sir , If you will , yet be happy , leave the humorAnd base subjection to your Wife , be wise , And let her know with speed , you are her Husband , I shall be glad to hear it.My horse is sent for. [ Exit .
Even such another countrey thing as thisWas I , such a piece of dirt , so heavy , So provident to heap up ignorance , And be an ass : such musty cloaths wore I , So old and thred-bare , I do yet rememberDivers young Gallants lighting at my Gate , To see my honoured Wife , have offered pence , And bid me walk their horses , such a slaveWas I in shew then : but my eyes are open 'd .
Many sweet morrows to my worthy Wife .
'T is well , and aptly given , as much for you , But to my present business , which is money --
Lady , I have none left .
I hope you dare not say so , nor imagine so base and low , A thought : I have none left ? Are these words fitting for a man of worth , And one of your full credit ? Do you knowThe place you live in ? me ? and what I labourFor , you ? and your advancement ?
Yes my dearest .
Now heaven forbid I should do wrong to youMy dearest Wife , and Madam ; yet give leaveTo your poor creature to unfold himself.You know my debts are many more than means , My bands not taken in , my friends at homeDrawn dry with these expences , my poor TenantsMore full of want than we , then what new courseCan I beget , to raise those crowns by ? speak , And I shall execute .
Pray tell me true , Have you not Land in the Countrey ?
Pardon me , I had forgot it .
Sir , you must remember it , There is no remedy , this Land must be , In Paris e'r to morrow night .
It shall , let me consider , some 300 acresWill serve the turn .
'Twill furnish at all points , Now you speak like your self , and know like him , That means to be a man , suspect no lessFor the return will give ye five for one , You shall be great to morrow , I have said it.Farewel , and see this business be a-foot , With expedition. [ Exit Wife .
Health , all joy , and honorWait on my lovely Wife. What ? Jaques , Jaques .
Jaques .
Sir , did you call ?
I did so , hie thee Jaques.Down to the Bank , and there to some good Merchant ( Conceive me well , good Jaques , and be private ) Offer 300 acres of my Land : Say it is choice and fertile , ask upon itFive thousand Crowns , this is the businessI must employ thee in , be wise and speedy .
Sir , do not do this .
Knave , I must have money .
If you have money thus , your knave must tell yeYou will not have a foot of Land left , be more wary , And more friend to your self , this honest LandYour Worship has discarded , has been true , And done you loyal service .
Gentle Jaques , You have a merry wit , employ it wellAbout the business you have now in hand.When ye come back , enquire me in the Presence , If not in the Tennis-Court , or at my house. [ Exit .
If this vain hold , I know where to enquire ye.Five thousand Crowns ! this , with good husbandry , May hold a month out , then 5000 more , And more Land a bleeding for't , as many more , And more Land laid aside. God and St. DennisKeep honest minded young men batchelors.'Tis strange , my Master should be yet so youngA puppy , that he can not see his fallAnd got so near the Sun. I 'll to his Cosin.And once more tell him o n't , if he fail , Then to my Mortgage , next unto my sale. [ Exit .
Longovile , Bewford , and the Servant .
Gentlemen , hold on discourse a while , I shall return with knowledge how and whereWe shall have best access unto my MistrissTo tender your devotions. [ Exit .
Be it so : Now to our first discourse .
I prethee peace ; Thou canst not be so bad , or make me knowSuch things are living , do not give thy selfSo common and so idle , so open vile , So great a wronger of thy worth , so low , I can not , nor I must not credit thee .
Now by this light I am a whoremaster , An open , and an excellent whormaster , And take a special glory that I am so : I thank my Stars I am a whoremaster , And such a one as dare be known and seen , And pointed at to be a noble wencher .
Do not let all ears hear this , hark [ y ] e Sir , I am my self a whoremaster , I amBelieve it Sir ( in private be it spoken ) I love a whore directly , most men are wenchers , And have profest the Science , few menThat look upon ye now , but whoremasters , Or have a full desire to be so .
This is noble .
It is without all question , being private , And held as needful as intelligence , But being once discover 'd , blown abroad , And known to common senses , 't is no moreThan geometrical rules in Carpenters , That only know some measure of an Art , But are not grounded : be no more deceived , I have a conscience to reclaim you , Sir.Mistake me not : I do not bid you leave your whoreOr less to love her ; forbid it , I should be such a villain to my friend , Or so unnatural : 't was never harbor 'd here , Learn to be secret first , then strike your Deer .
Your fair instructions , Mo [ n ] sieur , I shall learn .
And you shall have them ; I desire your care .
They are your servants .
You must not love .
How Sir ?
I mean a Lady , there 's danger.She hath an Usher and a Waiting Gentlewoman , A Page , a Coach-man , these are fee 'd and fee'dAnd yet for all that will be prating .
So .
You understand me Sir , they will discover't , And there is a loss of credit , Table-talkWill be the end of this , or worse , than that ; Will this be worthy of a Gentleman ?
Proceed good Sir .
Next leave your City Dame ; The best of that Tribe , are most meerly coy , Or most extreamly foolish , both which vicesAre no great stirrers up , unless in HusbandsThat owe this Cattle , fearing her that 's coyTo be but seeming , her that 's fool too forward .
This is the rarest fellow , and the soundest , I mean in knowledge , that e'r wore a Codpiece , H'as found out that will pass all Italy , All France and England ; to their shames I speak , And to the griefs of all their Gentlemen , The noble Theory of Luxury .
Your patience , And I will lay before your eyes a courseThat I my self found out , 't is excellent , Easie , and full of freedome .
O good Sir , You rack me till I know it .
This it is , When your desire is up , your blood well heatedAnd apt for sweet encounter , chuse the night , And with the night your Wench , the streets have store , There seize upon her , get her to your chamber , Give her a cardecew , 't is royal payment ; When ye are dull , dismiss her , no man knows , Nor she her self , who hath encountred her .
O but their faces .
Nere talke of faces : The night allows her equal with a Dutchess , Imagination doth all think her fair , And great , clapt in Velvet , she is so , Sir , I have tryed those , and do find it certainIt never failes me , 't is but twelve nights sinceMy last experience .
O my meiching Varlet , I 'll fit ye as I live.'Tis excellent , I 'll be your Scholar Sir .
Lady and Servant .
You are fairly welcome both : troth GentlemenYou have been strangers , I could chide you for't , And taxe ye with unkindness , What 's the news ? The Town was never empty of some novelty ; Servant , What 's your intelligence ?
Faith nothing.I have not heard of any worth relating .
Nor I sweet Lady .
Then give me attention,
mad .
Mad ?
Mad as May-butter , And which is more , mad for a Wench .
'T is strange , and full of pity .
All that comes near himHe thinks are come of purpose to betray him , Being full of strange conceit : the wench he lovedStood very near the Crown .
Alass good Monsieur ; A ' was a proper man , and fair demean 'd , A Person worthy of a better temper .
He is strong opinion 'd that the Wench he lov'dRemains close prisoner by the Kings command : Fearing her title , when the poor grieved GentlewomanFollows him much lamenting , and much lovingIn hope to make him well , he knows her not , Nor any else that comes to visit him .
Let 's walk in Gentlemen , and there discourseHis further miseries , you shall stay dinner , In truth you must obey .
We are your servants. [ Exeunt .
There 's no good to be done , no cure to be wroughtUpon my desperate Kinsman : I 'll to horseAnd leave him to the fools whip , misery.I shall recover twenty miles this night , My horse stands ready , I 'll away with speed .
Shattillion .
Sir , may I crave your name ?
Yes Sir you may : My name is Cleremont .
'T is well , your faction ? What party knit you with ?
I know no parties , Nor no Factions , Sir .
Then weare this Cross of white : And where you see the like they are my friends , Observe them well , the time is dangerous .
Sir keep your cross , I 'll weare none , sure this fellowIs much beside himself , grown mad .
A word Sir ; You can pick nothing out of this , this crossIs nothing but a cross , a very cross , Plain , without spell , or witchcraft , search it , You may suspect , and well , there 's poyson i n't , Powder , or wild-fire , but 't is nothing so .
I do believe you , Sir , 't is a plain cross .
Then do your worst , I care not , tell the King , Let him know all this , as I am sure he shall ; When you have spit your venome , then will IStand up a faithful , and a loyal Subject , And so God save His Grace , this is no Treason .
He is March mad , farewell Monsieur. [ Exit Couzen .
Farewel ; I shall be here attending , 't is my lifeThey aime at , there 's no way to save it , wellLet 'em spread all their nets : they shall not draw meInto any open Treason , I can see , And can beware , I have my wits about me , I thank heaven for't .
Love .
There he goes , That was the fairest hope the French Court bred , The worthiest and the sweetest temper 'd spirit , The truest , and the valiantest , the best of judgment , Till most unhappy I : sever 'd those virtues , And turn 'd his wit wild with a coy denial , Which heaven forgive me , and be pleas 'd , O heavenTo give again his senses : that my loveMay strike off all my follies .
Lady .
I Sir .
Your will with me sweet Lady .
Sir , I come .
From the dread sovereign King , I know it Lady , He is a gracious Prince , long may he live , Pertain you to his chamber ?
No indeed Sir , That place is not for women , Do you know me ?
Yes , I do know you .
What 's my name ? pray you speak .
That 's all one , I do know you and your business , You are discover 'd Lady , I am wary , It stands upon my life ; pray excuse me , The best man of this Kingdom sent you hither , To dive into me , have I toucht you ? ha ?
You are deceiv 'd Sir , I come from your love , That sends you fair commends , and many kisses .
Alass , poor soul , How does she ? Is she living ? Keeps she her bed still ?
Still Sir , She is living , And well , and shall do so .
Are ye in counsel ?
No Sir , nor any of my sex .
Why so , If you had been in counsel , you would know , Her time to be but slender ; she must die .
I do believe it , Sir .
And suddenly , She stands too near a fortune .
Sir ?
'T is so , There is no jesting with a Princes Title , Would we had both been born of common parents , And liv 'd a private and retir 'd life , In homely cottage , we had then enjoyed , Our loves , and our embraces , these are things , That can not tend to Treason --
I am wretched .
O I pray as often for the King as any , And with as true a heart , for 's continuance , And do moreover pray his heirs may live ; And their fair issues , then as I am boundFor all the states and commons : if these prayersBe any wayes ambitious , I submit , And lay my head down , let 'em take it off ; You may informe against me , but withallRemember my obedience to the Crown , And service to the State .
Good Sir , I love ye .
Then love the gracious King , and say with me .
Heaven save his Grace .
This is strange -- A woman should be sent to undermine me , And buz love into me to try my spirit ; Offer me kisses , and enticing follies , To make me open , and betray my self ; It was a subtile and a dangerous plot , And very soundly followed , farewel Lady , Let me have equal hearing , and relateI am an honest Man. Heaven save the King. [ Exit .
I 'll never leave him , till , by art or prayer , I have restor 'd his senses , If I makeHim perfect Man again , he 's mine , till when , I here abjure all loves of other men. [ Exit .
Cozen , and Jaques .
Nay , good Sir be perswaded , go but back , And tell him hee 's undone , say nothing else ; And you shall see how things will work upo n't .
Not so good Jaques , I am held an asse , A Countrey Fool , good to converse with dirt , And eate course bread , weare the worst Wooll , Know nothing but the high-way to Paris , And wouldst thou have me bring these stains , And imperfections to the rising viewOf the right worshipful thy worthy Master ? They must be bright , and shine , their cloathsSoft Velvet , and the Tyrian PurpleLike the Arabian gums , hung like the Sun , Their golden beames on all sides ; Such as these may come and knowThy Master , I am base , and dare not speak unto him , Hee 's above me .
If ever you did love him , or his state , His name , his issue , or your self , go back : 'Twill be an honest and a noble partWorthy a Kinsman ; save 300 AcresFrom present execution ; they have had sentence , And can not be repriev 'd , be merciful .
Have I not urg 'd already all the reasons , I had to draw him from his will ? his ruin ? But all in vain , no counsel will prevail ; H'as fixt himself , there 's no removing , Jaques , 'Twill prove but breath and labor spent in vain , I 'll to my horse , farewell .
For Gods sake , Sir , As ever you have hope of joy , turn back ; I 'll be your slave for ever , do but go , And I will lay such fair directions to youThat if he be not doting on his fall , He shall recover sight , and see his danger , And ye shall tell him of his Wives abuses , I fear , too foul against him ; how she plots , With our young Mounsiers , to milk-dry her husband , And lay it on their backs ; the next her pride ; Then what his debts are , and how infiniteThe curses of his Tenants , this will workI 'll pawn my life and head , he cries away , I 'll to my house in the Countrey .
Come , I 'll go , and once more try him , If he yield not , so , The next that tryes him shall be want and woe. [ Exeunt .
Jaques .
Sir. [ Within .
Rise Jaques 't is grown day , The Country life is best , where quietly , Free from the clamor of the troubled Court , We may enjoy our own green shadowed walks , And keep a moderate diet without art.Why did I leave my house , and bring my Wife , To know the manner of this subtile place ? I would , when first the lust to fame and honor , Possest me , I had met with any evil , But that ; had I been tied to stay at home , And earn the bread for the whole family , With my own hand , happy had I been .
Jaques .
Sir , this is from your wonted course at home , When did ye there keep such inordinate hours ? Goe to bed late ? start thrice ? and call on me ? Would you were from this place ; our Countrey sleeps , Although they were but of that moderate lengthThat might maintain us in our daily work , Yet were they sound and sweet .
I Jaques , there we dreamt not of our Wives , we lay together ; And needed not ; now at length my Cozens words , So truly meant , mixt with thy timely prayersSo often urged , to keep me at my home , Condemn me quite .
'T was not your fathers course : He liv 'd and dy 'd in Orleance , where he hadHis Vines as fruitful as experience ( Which is the art of Husbandry ) could make ; He had his presses for 'em , and his winesWere held the best , and out-sold other Mens , His corn and cattel serv 'd the neighbor TownsWith plentiful provision , yet his thriftCould miss one Beast amongst the heard ; He rul 'd more where he liv 'd , than ever you will here .
'T is true , why should my Wife then , 'gainst my good , Perswade me to continue in this course ?
Why did you bring her hither at the first , Before you warm 'd her blood with new delights ? Our Countrey sports could have contented her ; When you first married her a puppet-playPleas 'd her as well as now the tilting doth.She thought her self brave in a bugle chain , Where Orient pearl will scarce content her now .
Sure Jaques , she sees something for my goodMore than I do ; she oft will talk to meOf Offices , and that she shortly hopes , By her acquaintance with the friends she hath , To get a place shall many times outweighOur great expences , and if this be so --
Think better of her words , she doth deceive you , And only for her vain and sensual endsPerswade ye thus. Let me be set to dwellFor ever naked in the barest soil , So you will dwell from hence .
I see my folly , Pack up my stuffe , I will away this morne.Haste -- haste .
I , now I see your Father 's honorsTrebling upon you , and the many prayersThe Countrey spent for him , which almost nowBegun to turn to curses , turning back , And falling like a [ timely ] showerUpon ye .
Goe , call [ up ] my Wife .
But shall she not prevail , And sway you , as she oft hath done before ?
I will not hear her , but raile on her , Till I be ten miles off .
If you be forty , 'Twill not be worse Sir:
Call her up .
I will Sir. [ Exit .
Why what an Ass was I that such a thingAs a Wife is could rule me ! Know not I that woman was created for the man , That her desires , nay all her thoughts should beAs his are ? is my sense restor 'd at length ? Now she shall know , that which she should desire , She hath a husband that can govern her,
If her desires leads me against my will ; Are you come ?
What sad unwonted courseMakes you raise me so soon , that went to bedSo late last-night .
O you shall goe to bed sooner hereafter , And be rais 'd again at thrifty hours : In Summer time wee'l walkAn hour after our Supper , and to bed , In Winter you shall have a set at Cards , And set your Maids to work .
What do you mean ?
I will no more of your new tricks , your honors , Your Offices , and all your large preferments , Which still you beat into my ears , hang o'er me , I 'll leave behind for others , the great swayWhich I shall bear at Court : my living hereWith countenance of your honoured friends , I 'll be content to lose : for you speak thisOnly that you may still continue hereIn wanton ease : and draw me to consume , In cloaths and other things idle for shew , That which my Father got with honest thrift .
Why , who hath been with you Sir , That you talk thus out of Frame .
You make a fool of me : You provide one to bid me forth to supper , And make me promise ; then must some one or otherInvite you forth , if you have born your selfLoosely to any Gentleman in my sightAt home , you ask me how I like the carriage , Whether it were not rarely for my good , And open 'd not a way to my preferment ? Come , I perceive all : talk not , we 'll away .
Why Sir , you 'll stay till the next triumphDay be past ?
I , you have kept me here triumphingThis seven years , and I have ridden through the streets , And bought embroyder 'd hose and foot-cloths too , To shew a subjects zeal , I rode beforeIn this most gorgeous habit , and salutedAll the acquaintance I could espieFrom any window , these are wayes ye told meTo raise me ; I see all : make you ready straight , And in that Gown which you came first to Town in , Your safe-guard , cloak , and your hood sutable : Thus on a double gelding shall you amble , And my man Jaques shall be set before you .
But will you goe ?
I will .
And shall I too ?
And you shall too .
But shall I by this light ?
Why by this light you shall .
Then by this lightYou have no care of your Estate , and mine.Have we been seven years venturing in a Ship , And now upon return , with a fair wind , And a calm Sea , full fraught with our own wishes , Laden with wealth and honor to the brim , And shall we flye away and not receive it ? Have we been tilling , sowing , labouring , With pain and charge a long and tedious winter , And when we see the corn above the ground , Youthful as is the Morn and the full eare , That promises to stuffe our spacious garners , Shall we then let it rot , and never reap it ?
Wife talke no more , your Rhetorick comes too late , I am inflixible ; and how dare youAdventure to direct my course of life ? Was not the husband made to rule the Wife ?
'T is true : but where the man doth miss his way , It is the Womans part to set him right ; So Fathers have a power to guide their SonsIn all their courses , yet you oft have seenPoor little children , that have both their eyes , Lead their blind Fathers .
She has a plaguy wit , I say you'r but a little piece of man .
But such a piece , as being tane away , Man can not last : the fairest and tallest ship , That ever sail 'd , is by a little piece of the sameWood , steer 'd right , and turn 'd about .
'T is true she sayes , her answers stand with reason .
But Sir , your Cozin put this in your head , Who is an enemy to your preferment , Because I should not take place of his wife ; Come , by this kiss , thou shalt not go sweet heart .
Come , by this kiss I will go Sweet-heart , On with your riding stuffe : I know your tricks , And if preferment fall ere you be ready , 'T is welcome , else adieu the City life .
Well , Sir , I will obey .
About it then .
To please your humor I would dress my self , In the most loathsome habit you could name , Or travel any whether o 're the World , If you command me , it shall ne'r be said , The frailty of a woman , whose weak mind , Is often set on loose delights , and shews , Hath drawn her husband to consume his state , In the vain hope of that which never fell .
About it then , women are pleasant creatures , When once a man begins to know himself .
But hark you Sir , because I will be sure , You shall have no excuse , no word to sayIn your defence hereafter ; when you seeWhat honors were prepar 'd for you and me , Which you thus willingly have thrown away , I tell you I did look for present honor , This morning for you , which I know had come : But if they do not come ere I am ready ( Which I will be the sooner least they should ) When I am once set in a countrey life , Not all the power of earth shall alter me , Not all your prayers or threats shall make me speakThe least words to my honorable friends , To do you any grace .
I will not wish it .
And never more hope to be honorable .
My hopes are lower .
As I live you shall not , You shall be so far from the name of nobleThat you shall never see a Lord again ; You shall not see a Maske , or Barriers , Or Tilting , or a solemn Christning , Or a great Marriage , or new Fire-works , Or any bravery ; but you shall liveAt home , bespotted with your own lov 'd durt , In scurvy cloaths , as you were wont to doe , And to content you , I will live so too .
Tis all I wish , make haste , the day draws on , It shall be my care to see your Stuffe packt up .
It shall be my care to gull you : you shall stay. [ Ex. Gen.And more than so , intreat me humbly too , You shall have honors presently ; Maria .
Maria .
Madam .
Bring hither , pen , ink , and paper .
'T is here .
Your Master will not stay , Unless preferment come within an hour .
Let him command one of the City gates , In time of mutiny , or you may provide him , To be one of the counsel for invading , Some savage Countrey to plant Christian faith .
No , no , I have it for him , call my page ; Now , my dear husband , there it is will fit you. [ Ex. Maria.And when the world shall see what I have done , Let it not move the spleen of any Wife , To make an Ass of her beloved husband , Without good ground , but if they will be drawnTo any reason by you , do not gull them ; But if they grow conceited of themselves , And be fine Gentlemen , have no mercy , Publish them to the World , 'twill do them goodWhen they shall see their follies understood , Go bear these Letters to my servant , And bid him make haste , I will dress my self , In all the Journey-Cloaths I us 'd before , Not to ride , but to make the Laughter more. [ Exit .
Gentleman , and Jaques .
Is all packt up ?
All , all Sir , there is no tumblerRuns through his hoop with more dexterity , Then I about this business : 'T is a day , That I have long long 'd to see .
Come , Where 's my Spurs ?
Here , Sir , and now 't is come .
I , Jaques , now , I thank my fates , I can command my Wife .
I am glad to see it , Sir .
I do not love alwayes , To be made a puppie , Jaques .
But , yet me thinks your Worship does not look , Right like a Countrey Gentleman .
I will , give me my t'other hat .
Here .
So , my Jerkin .
Yes , Sir .
On with it Jaques , thou and IWill live so finely in the Countrey , Jaques , And have such pleasant walks into the WoodsA mornings , and then bring home riding-rods , And walking staves --
And I will bear them , Sir , And Skurdge-sticks for the children .
So thou shalt , And thou shalt do all , over-see my Work-folkes , And at the weeks end pay them all their wages .
I will , Sir , so your Worship give me Money .
Thou shalt receive all too : give me my Drawers .
They are ready , Sir .
And I will make thy Mistriss , My wife , look to her landrie , and her dairy , That we may have our linnen clean on Sundayes .
And Holy-dayes .
I , and ere we walk about the GroundsProvide our break-fast , Or she shall smoke , I 'll have her a good huswife ; She shall not make a voyage to her Sisters , But she shall live at home , And feed her pullen fat , and see her MaidesIn bed before her , and lock all the doors .
Why that will be a life for Kings and Queens .
Give me my Scarfe with the great Button quickly .
'T is done , Sir .
Now my Mittens .
Here they are , Sir .
'T is well : now my great dagger .
There .
Why so ; thus it should be , now my riding rod .
There 's nothing wanting , Sir .
Another , man , to stick under my girdle .
There it is .
All is well .
Why now methinks your Worship looksLike to your self , a Man of means and credit , So did your grave and famous Ancestors , Ride up and down to Fairs , and cheapen cattel .
Goe , hasten your Mistriss , Sirra .
It shall be done. [ Ex. Jaques .
Servant and Page .
Who 's that ? who 's that Boy ?
I think it be my Master .
Who , he that walkes in gray , whisking his riding rod ?
Yes , Sir , 't is he .
'T is he indeed ; he is prepar'dFor his new journey ; when I wink upon you , Run out and tell the Gentleman 't is time --
good day .
Monsieur , your Mistriss is within , but yet not ready .
My business is with you , Sir ; 't is reported , I know not whether by some enemyMaliciously , that envies your great hopes , And would be ready to sow discontentsBetwixt his Majesty , and you , or truely , Which on my faith I would be sorry for , That you intend to leave the Court in haste .
Faith , Sir , within this half hour. Jaques ?
Sir ?
Is my Wife ready ?
Presently .
But Sir , I needs must tell you , as I am your friend , You should have ta'en your journey privater , For 't is already blaz 'd about the Court .
Why Sir , I hope it is no Treason , is it ?
'T is true , Sir , but 't is grown the common talk , There 's no discovery else held , and in the presenceAll the Nobility and Gentry , Have nothing in their mouths but only this,
, that noble Gentleman , Is now departing hence : every Mans faceLooks ghastly on his fellows ; such a sadness ( Before this day ) I ne'er beheld in Court , Mens hearts begin to fail them when they hear it , In expectation of the great eventThat needs must follow it , pray Heaven it be good !
Why , I had rather all their hearts should fail , Than I stay here until my purse fail me .
But yet you are a Subject , and beware , I charge you by the love I bear to you , How you do venture rashly on a course , To make your Sovereign jealous of your deeds , For Princes jealousies , where they love most , Are easily found , but they be hardly lost .
Come , these are tricks , I smell 'em , I will goe .
Have I not still profest my self your friend ?
Yes , but you never shewd it to me yet .
But now I will , because I see you wise , And give ye thus much light into a business , That came to me but now , be resolute , Stand stifly to it that you will depart , And presently .
Why so I mean to doe .
And by this light you may be what you will ; Will you be secret , Sir ?
Why ? What 's the matter ?
The King does fear you .
How ?
And is now in Counsel ;
About me ?
About you , and you be wise , You 'll find he 's in Counsel about you : His Counsellors have told him all the truth .
What truth ?
Why , that which now he knows too well .
What is't ?
That you have followed him seven years , With a great train : and though he have not grac't you , Yet you have div 'd into the hearts of thousands , With liberality and noble carriage ; And if you should depart home unprefer 'd , All discontented , and seditious spiritsWould flock to you , and thrust you into action : With whose help , and your Tenants , who doth not know ( If you were so dispos 'd : ) How great a part of this yet fertile peaceful Realm of FranceYou might make desolate ? but when the KingHeard this --
What said he ?
Nothing , but shook , As never Christian Prince did shake before.And to be short , you may be what you willBut be not ambitious Sir , sit downWith moderate honors , least you make your selfMore fear 'd .
I know , Sir , what I have to doeIn mine own business .
Longavile .
Where 's Monsieur Mount Marine ?
Why there he stands , will you ought with him ?
Yes : Good day Monsieur Marine .
Good day to you .
His Majesty doth commend himself , Most kindly to you Sir , and hath , by me , Sent you this favor : kneel down , rise a Knight .
I thank his Majesty .
And he doth further request you , Not to leave the Court so soon , For though your former merits have been slighted , After this time there shall no Office fall ; Worthy your spirit , as he doth confessThere 's none so great , but you shall surely have it .
Do you hear ? if you yield yet you are an ass .
I 'll shew my service to his MajestyIn greater things than these , but for this small oneI must intreat his Highness to excuse me .
I 'll bear your Knightly words unto the King , And bring his Princely answer back again. [ Exit Long .
Well said , be resolute a while , I knowThere is a tide of honors coming on.I warrant you .
Bewford .
Where is this new made Knight ?
Here , Sir .
Let me enfold you in my arms , Then call you Lord , the King will have it so , Who doth entreat your Lordship to rememberHis Message sent to you by Longavile .
If ye be durty , and dare not mount aloft ; You may yield now , I know what I would do .
Peace , I will fit him ; tell his MajestyI am a Subject , and I do confessI serve a gracious Prince , that thus hath heaptHonors on me without desert , but yetAs for the Message , business urgeth me , I must be gone , and he must pardon me , Were he ten thousand Kings and Emperors .
I 'll tell him so .
Why , this was like your self .
As he hath wrought him , 't is the finest fellowThat e 're was Christmas Lord , he carries itSo truely to the life , as though he wereOne of the plot to gull himself. [ Exit Bewf .
Why so , you sent the wisest and the shrewdest answerUnto the King , I swear , my honored friend , That ever any Subject sent his Liege .
Nay now I know I have him on the hip , I 'll follow it .
Longavile .
My honorable Lord , Give me your noble hand right courteous Peer , And from henceforth be a courtly Earl ; The King so wills , and Subjects must obey : Only he doth desire you to considerOf his request .
Why faith you'r well my Lord , yield to him .
Yield ? why 't was my plot .
Nay , 't was your Wives plot .
To get preferment by it , And thinks he now to pop me i'th ' mouthBut with an Earldome ? I 'll be one step higher .
'T is the finest Lord , I am afraid anonHe will stand upo n't to share the Kingdom with him .
Bewford .
Where 's this Courtly Earl ? His Majesty commends his love unto you ; And will you but now grant to his request , He bids you be a Duke , and chuse of whence .
Why if you yield not now , you are undone , What can you wish to have more , but the Kingdom ?
So please his Majesty , I would be D. of Burgundy , Because I like the place .
I know the King is pleas 'd .
Then will I stay and kiss his Highness hand .
His Majesty will be a glad man when he hears it .
But how shall we keep this from the world 's ear , That some one tell him not , he is no Duke ?
Wee'l think of that anon.Why Gentlemen , Is this a gracious habit for a Duke ? Each gentle body set a finger toTo pluck the clouds of this his riding weedsFrom off the orient Sun of his best cloaths ; I 'll pluck one Boot and spur off .
I another .
I 'll pluck his Jerkin off .
Sit down my Lord ; Both his spurs off at once good Longavile , And Bewford , take that Scarfe off , and that Hat , Doth not become his largely sprouting fore-head.Now set your gracious foot to this of mine , One pluck will do it , so , off with the other .
Loe , thus your servant Longavile doth pluckThe trophy of your former gentry off.Off with his Jerkin Bewford .
Didst thou never seeA nimble footed Taylor stand so in his stockings , Whilst some friend help 'd to pluck his Jerkin off , To dance a Jigg ?
Jaques .
Here 's his man Jaques come , Booted and ready still .
My Mistriss stayes ; Why how now Sir ? What do 's your Worship mean , To pluck your grave and thrifty habit off .
My slippers , Jaques .
O thou mighty Duke , Pardon this Man , That thus hath trespassed in ignorance .
I pardon him .
His Graces slippers , Jaques .
Why what 's the matter ?
Foot-man , he 's a Duke : The King hath rais 'd him above all his Land .
I 'll to his Cozen presently , and tell him so ; O what a dung-hill Countrey rogue was I. [ Exit Jaques .
Wife .
See , see , my Mistriss .
Let 's observe their greeting .
Unto your will , as every good Wife ought , I have turn 'd all my thoughts , and now am ready .
O Wife , I am not worthy to kiss the leastOf all thy toes , much less thy Thumb , Which yet I would be bold with ; all thy counselHath been to me Angelical , but mine to theeHath been most dirty , like my mind : Dear Duchess I must stay .
What are you mad , to make meDress , and undress , turn and wind me , Because you find me plyant ? said I notThe whole world should not alter me , if onceI were resolv 'd ? and now you call me Duchess : Why what 's the matter ?
Loe a Knight doth kneel .
A Knight ?
A Lord .
A Fool .
I say doth kneel an Earl , a Duke .
In Drawers .
Without shoes .
Sure you [ are ] lunatick .
No , honoured Duchess , If you dare but believe your servants truth , I know he is a Duke .
God save his Grace .
I ask your Graces pardon .
Then I rise , And here , in token that all strife shall end , 'Twixt thee and me , I let my drawers fall , And to thy hands I do deliver them : Which signifies , that in all acts and speeches , From this time forth , my Wife shall wear the breeches .
An honorable composition. [ Exeunt omnes .
Cozen , and Jaques .
Shall I believe thee , Jaques ?
Sir you may .
Didst thou not dreame ?
I did not .
Nor imagine ?
Neither of both : I saw him great and mighty , I saw the Monsieurs bow , and heard them cry , Good health and fortune to my Lord the Duke .
A Duke art sure ? a Duke ?
I am sure a Duke , And so sure , as I know my self for Jaques .
Yet the Sun may dazel ; Jaques , Was it notSome leane Commander of an angry Block-houseTo keep the Fleemish Eele-boats from invasion , Or some bold Baron able to dispendHis fifty pounds a year , and meet the foeUpon the Kings command , in gilded canvas , And do his deeds of worth ? or was it notSome place of gain , as Clerk to the great BandOf maribones , that people call the Switzers ? Men made of Beufe , and Sarcenet ?
Is a Duke his chamber hung with Nobles like a presence ?
I am something wavering in my faith ; Would you would settle me , and swear 't is so , Is he a Duke indeed ?
I swear he is .
I am satisfied , he is my Kinsman. Jaques , And I his poor unworthy Cozen .
True , Sir .
I might have been a Duke too , I had means , A wife as fair as his , and as wise as his ; And could have brookt the Court as well as his , And laid about her for her husbands honor : O Jaques , had I ever dreamt of this , I had prevented him .
Faith Sir it cameAbove our expectation , we were wiseOnly in seeking to undoe this honor , Which shewed our dung-hill breeding and our durt .
But tell me Jaques , Why could we not perceive ? what dull DivelWrought us to cross this noble course , perswading'Twould be his overthrow ? 'fore me a CourtierIs he that knows all , Jaques , and does all , 'T is as his noble Grace hath often said , And very wisely , Jaques , we are fools , And understand just nothing .
I , as we were , I confess it.But rising with our great Master , We shall be call 'd to knowledge with our places , 'T is nothing to be wise , not thus much there , There 's not the least of the billet dealers , Nor any of the Pastry , or the Kitchin , But have it in measure delicate .
Methinks this greatness of the Dukes my Cozens , ( I ask you mercy , Jaques , that near nameIs too familiar for me ) should give promiseOf some great benefits to his attendants .
I have a suit my self , and it is sure , Or I mistake my ends much .
What is't Jaques , May I not crave the place ?
Yes , Sir , you shall , 'T is to be but his Graces Secretary , Which is my little all , and my ambition , Till my known worth shall take me by the hand , And set me higher ; how the fates may doIn this poor thread of life , is yet uncertain ; I was not born I take it for a Trencher , Nor to espouse my Mistriss Dairy-maid .
I am resolv 'd my Wife shall up to Court ; I 'll furnish her , that is a speeding course , And can not chuse but breed a mighty fortune ; What a fine youth was I , to let him start , And get the rise before me ! I 'll dispatch , And put my self in Moneys .
Mass 't is true , And now you talke of Money ; Sir , my businessFor taking those Crowns must be dispatcht : This little plot in the Countrey lies most fitTo do his Grace such serviceable uses , I must about it .
Yet , before you goe , Give me your hand , and bear my humble serviceTo the great Duke your Master , and his Duchess , And live your self in favor : say my WifeShall there attend them shortly , so farewell .
I 'll see you mounted , Sir .
It may not be , Your place is far above it , spare your self , And know I am your servant , fare ye well. [ Exit Couzen .
Sir I shall rest to be commanded by you , This place of Secretary will not content me , I must be more and greater : let me see ; To be a Baron is no such great matterAs people take it : for say I were a Count , I am still an under-person to this Duke , Which methinks sounds but harshly : but a Duke ? O I am strangely taken , 't is a DukeOr nothing , I 'll advise upo n't , and seeWhat may be done by wit and industry. [ Exit .
Wife , Longoveil , Bewford , Servants .
It must be carried closely with a careThat no man speak unto him , or come near him , Without our private knowledge , or be madeAfore-hand to our practice : My good husband , I shall entreat you now to stay a while , And prove a noble coxcomb.Gentlemen , Your counsel and advice about this carriage .
Alas good man , I do begin to mournHis dire Massacre : what a persecutionIs pouring down upon him ! sure he is sinful .
Let him be kept in 's chamber under shewOf state and dignity , and no man suffer'dTo see his noble face , or have access , But we that are Conspirators .
Or else down with him into the Countrey amongst his Tenants , There he may live far longer in his greatness , And play the fool in pomp amongst his fellows .
No , he shall play the fool in the City , and stay , I will not lose the greatness of this jest , That shall be given to my wit , for the whole Revenues .
Then thus wee 'll have a guard about his person , That no man come too near him , and our selvesAlwayes in company ; have him into the CityTo see his face swell ; whilst , in divers corners , Some of our own appointing shall be readyTo cry heaven bless your Grace , long live your Grace .
Servant , your counsel 's excellent good , And shall be follow 'd , 'twill be rarely strangeTo see him stated thus , as though he wentA shroving through the City , or intendedTo set up some new [ stake ] : I shall not holdFrom open laughter , when I hear him cry , Come hither my sweet Duchess : let me kissThy gracious lips : for this will be his phrases ? I fear me nothing but his legs will breakUnder his mighty weight of such a greatness .
Now me thinks dearest Lady you are too cruel ; His very heart will freeze in knowing this .
No , no , the man was never of such deepness , To make conceit his Master : Sir , I 'll assure yeHe will out-live twenty such pageants.Were he but my Cozen , or my Brother , And such a desperate killer of his fortune , In this belief he should dye , though it cost meA thousand Crowns a day to hold it up ; Or were I not known his wife , and so to haveAn equal feeling of this ill he suffers , He should be thus till all the Boyes i'th ' TownMade sute to weare his badges in their hats , And walk before his Grace with sticks and nose-gayes , We Married Women hold --
'T is well , no more.The Duke is entring , set you [ r ] faces right , And bow like Countrey Prologues : here he comes.Make room afore , the Duke is entring .
The choisest fortunes wait upon our Duke .
And give him all content and happiness .
Let his great name live to the end of time .
We thank you , and are pleas 'd to give you noticeWe shall at fitter times wait on your Loves , Till when , be near Us .
'T is a valiant purge , and works extreamly ; 'Thas delivered himOf all Right worshipful and gentle humors , And left his belly full of nobleness .
It pleased the King my Master , For sundry vertues not unknown to him , And the all-seeing state , to lend his hand , And raise me to this Eminence , how thisMay seem to other Men , or stir the mindsOf such as are my fellow Peers , I know not , I would desire their loves in just designs .
Now by my faith he does well , very well : Beshrew my heart I have not seen a better , Of a raw fellow , that before this dayNever rehearst his state : 't is marvellous well .
Is he not Duke indeed , see how he looksAs if his spirit were a last , or twoAbove his veins , and stretcht his noble hide .
Hee 's high-brac't like a Drum , pray God he break not .
Why let him break , there 's but a Calves-skin lost .
May it please your Grace to see the City , 'Twill be to the minds and much contentmentOf the doubtful people .
I am determin 'd so , till my returnI leave my honour 'd Dutchess to her chamber.Be careful of your health , I pray you be so .
Your Grace shall suffer us your humble servantsTo give attendance , fit so great a personUpon your body .
I am pleased so .
Away good Bewford , raise a guard sufficientTo keep him from the reach of Tongues , be quick ; And do you hear , remember how the streetsMust be dispos 'd with , for cries , and salutations.Your Grace determines not to see the King --
Not yet , I shall be ready ten dayes henceTo kiss his Highness hand , and give him thanks , As it is fit I should for his great bounty.Set forward Gentlemen .
Room for the Duke there. [ Exeunt Duke and Train .
'T is fit he should have room to shew his mightiness , He swells so with his poyson , 'T is better to reclaim ye thus , than makeA sheeps-head of you , It had been but your due ; But I have mercy Sir , and mean to reclaim youBy a directer course.That Woman is not worthy of a SoulThat has the sovereign power to rule her husband , And gives her title up , so long providedAs there be fair play , and his state not wrong 'd .
Shattillion .
I would be glad to know whence this new Duke springs , The people buz abroad ; or by what titleHe receiv 'd his dignity , 't is very strangeThere should be such close jugling in the State , But I am ty 'd to silence , yet a dayMay come , and soon to perfect all these doubts .
It is the mad Shattillion by my Soul , I suffer much for this poor Gentleman ; I 'll speak to him , may be he yet knows me .
Can you give me reason from whenceThis great Duke sprang that walks abroad ?
Even from the King himself .
As you are a Woman , I think you may be cover 'd ? Yet your prayer would do no harm good Woman .
God preserve him .
Shattillions Love .
I say Amen , and so say all good Subjects .
Lady , as ever you have lov 'd , or shall , As you have hope of heaven lend your hand , And wit , to draw this poor distracted manUnder your roofe , from the broad eyes of people , And wonder of the streets .
With all my heart ; My feeling of his grief and loss is much .
Sir , now you are come so near the prison , will yeGoe in , and visit your fair Love : poor soulShe would be glad to see you .
This same Duke is butApocryphal , there 's no creationThat can stand where titles are not right .
'T is true , Sir .
That is another draught upon my life ; Let me examine well the words I spake.The words I spake were , that this novel DukeIs not o'th ' true making , 't is to me most certain .
You are as right , Sir , as you went by line .
And to the grief of many thousands more .
If there be any such , God comfort them .
Whose mouths may open when the time shall please ; I 'm betray 'd , commend me to the King , And tell him I am sound , and crave but justice ; You shall not need to have your guard upon me , Which I am sure are plac 'd for my attachment ; Lead on ; I 'm obedient to my bonds .
Good Sir be not displeased with us ; We are but servants to his Highness will , To make that good .
I do forgive you even with my heart ; Shall I entreat a favor ?
Any thing .
To see my love before that fatal stroak , And publish to the world my christian death , And true obedience to the Crown of France .
I hope it shall not need Sir , for there is mercyAs well as Justice in his Royal heart. [ Exeunt .
Every man take his corner , here am I , You there , and you in that place , so be perfect , Have a great care your cries be loud ; and facesFull of dejected fear and humbleness.He comes .
Jaques .
Fye , how these streets are charg 'd and swell'dWith these same rascally people ! give more room , Or I shall have occasion to distributeA martial almes amongst you ; as I am a GentlemanI have not seen such rude disorder , They follow him like a prize , there 's no true gaperLike to your Citizen , he will be sureThe Beares shall not pass by his door in peace , But he and all his family will follow.Room there afore : Sound:
Give room , and keep your places , you may see enough ; keep your places .
These people are too far unmanner 'd , thusTo stop your Graces way with multitudes .
Rebuke them not , good Monsieur , 't is their lovesWhich I will answer , if it please my starsTo spare me life and health .
Bless your Grace .
And you with all my heart .
Now heaven preserve your happy dayes:
I thank you too .
Now Heaven save your Grace ;
I thank you all .
On there before .
Stand Gentlemen , stay yet a while.For I am minded to impart my loveTo these good people , and my friends , Whose love and prayers for my greatness , Are equal in abundance , note me well , And with my words ; my heart ? for as the Tree --
Your Grace had best beware , 'twill be inform'dYour greatness with the people .
I had more , My honest , and ingenious people. -- ButThe weight of business hath prevented me.I am call 'd from you : but this tree I spake ofShall bring forth fruit , I hope , to your content , And so I share my bowels amongst you all .
A noble Duke , a very noble Duke .
Afore there Gentlemen .
You'r faithfully met good Monsieur Mount Marine .
Be advis 'd , the time is alter 'd .
Is he not the same man he was afore ?
Still the same man to you , Sir .
You have received mighty Grace , be thankful .
Let me not dye in ignorance ;
You shall not.Then know , the King out of his love , hath pleas'dTo stile him Duke of Burgundy .
O great Duke , Thus low , I plead for pardon , and desireTo be enrol 'd amongst your poorest slaves .
Sir , you have mercy , and withal my hand , From henceforth let me call you one of mine .
Make room afore there , and dismiss the people .
Every Man to his house in peace and quiet .
Now heaven preserve the Duke , heaven bless the Duke. [ Exeunt Omnes .
This Letter came this morn from my CosinTo the great Lady , high and mighty DuchessOf Burgundy , be these delivered. Oh , For a stronger lace to keep my breathThat I may laugh the nine days till the wonderFall to an ebb : the high and mighty Duchess ? The high and mighty God ? what a stile is this ! Methinks it goes like a Duchy lope-man , A ladder of 100 rounds will failTo reach the top o n't : well my gentle CosinI know by these contents , your itch of honor ; You must to the Court you say , and very shortly : You shall be welcome ; and if your wife have witI 'll put her in a thriving course , if notHer own sin on her own head , not a blotShall stain my reputation , only thisI must for healths sake sometimes make an assOf the tame moil my Husband ; 'twill do him good , And give him fresher brains , Me fresher bloud.Now for the noble Duke , I hear him coming .
Your Grace is well return 'd .
As well as may be : Never in younger health , never more able : I mean to be your bed-fellow this night , Let me have good encounter .
Bless me heavenWhat a hot meat this greatness is !
It may be so , For I 'll be sworn he hath not got a snapThis two months on my knowledge , or her womanIs damn 'd for swearing it .
I thank you Gentlemen for your attendanceAnd also your great pains , pray know my LodgingsBetter and oftner , do so Gentlemen.Now by my honor , as I am a Prince , I speak sincerely , know my lodgings better , And be not strangers , I shall see your serviceAnd your deservings , when you least expect .
We humbly thank your grace for this great favor .
Jaques ?
Your Grace .
Be ready for the Countrey , And let my Tenants know the Kings great love : Say I would see them , but the weight at CourtLies heavy on my shoulders : let them knowI do expect their duties in attendanceAgainst the next feast , wait for my comingTo take up Post-horse , and be full of speed. [ Exit Jaq .
I would desire your Grace --
You shall desire , and have yourFull desire : sweet Duchess speak .
To have some conference with a GentlemanThat seems not altogether void of reason.He talks of Titles , and things near the Crown , And knowing none so fit as your [ good ] Grace , To give the difference in such points of State --
What is he ? if he be noble , or have any partThat 's worthy our converse , we do accept him .
I can assure your Grace , his strain is noble , But he 's very subtle .
Let him be so.Let him have all the brains , I shall demonstrateHow this most Christian Crown of France can bearNo other shew of Title than the Kings.I will go in and meditate for half an hour , And then be ready for him presently , I will convert him quickly , or confound him .
Is mad Shattillion here ?
Is here , and 's Lady , I prethee servant fetch him hither .
Why , what do you mean to put him to ?
To chat with the mad lad my Husband ; 'Twill be brave to hear them speak , babble , Stare , and prate .
But what shall be the end of all this , Lady ?
Shattillion and Lady .
Leave that to me , now for the grand dispute , For see , here comes Shattillion : as I live , methinksAll France should bear part of his griefs .
I 'll fetch my Lord the Duke .
Where am I now , or whether will you lead me ? To my death ? I crave my priviledge , I must not dye , but by just course of Law .
His Majesty hath sent by me your pardon , He meant not you should dye ; but would intreat youTo lay the full state of your Title open , Unto a grave and Noble Gentleman .
Duke and Longovile.The Duke of Burgundy who here doth come , Who , either by his wisdom will confute you , Or else inform and satisfie the King .
May't please your grace , this is the Gentleman .
Is this he that chops Logick with my Liege ?
D 'ye mock me ? you are great , the time will come , When you shall be as much contemn 'd as I , Where are the antient compliments of France , The upstarts brave the Princes of the bloud ?
Your Title Sir , in short .
He must Sir , Be a better States-man than your self , that canTrip me in any thing , I will not speakBefore these witnesses .
Depart the room , for none shall stay , No , not my dearest Duchess .
We 'll stand behind the Arras and hear all. [ Exeunt .
In that chair take your place , I in this , Discourse your Title now .
Sir , you shall know , My Loves true Title , mine by Marriage , Setting aside the first race of French Kings , Which will not here concern us , as Pharamond , With Clodian , Meroveus , and Chilperick , And to come down unto the second Race , Which we will likewise slip --
But take me with you .
I pray you give me leave , of Martel Charles , The Father of King Pippin , who was , SireTo Charles the Great , and famous Charlemain.And to come to the third Race of French Kings , Which will not be greatly pertinent in this cause , Betwixt the King and me , of which you know
was the first , Next his Son Robert , Henry then , and PhilipWith Lewis , and his Son a Lewis too , And of that name the Seventh , but all thisSprings from a Female , as it shall appear .
Now give me leave , I grant you this your TitleAt the first sight , carries some shew of truth ; But if ye weigh it well , ye shall find light.Is not his Majesty possest in peace , And justice executed in his name , And can you think the most Christian KingWould do this if he saw not reason for it ?
But had not the Tenth Lewis a sole Daughter ?
I can not tell .
But answer me directly .
It is a most seditious question .
Is this your justice ?
I stand for my King .
Was ever Heir-apparant thus abus 'd ? I 'll have your head for this .
Why , do your worst .
Will no one stir to apprehend this Traitor ? A guard about my person , will none come ? Must my own royal hands perform the deed ? Then thus I do arrest you .
Treason , help .
, Long. Bew. and Serv .
Help , help , my Lord and Husband .
Help the Duke .
Forbear his grace 's person .
Forbear you to touch him thatYour Heir-apparent weds , But by this hand , I will have all your heads. [ Exit .
How doth your Grace ?
Why ? well .
How do you find his Title ?
'T is a dangerous one , As can come by a female .
I , 't is true , But the Law Salique cuts him off from all .
I do beseech your Grace , how stands his Title ?
Pew , nothing ; the Law Salique cuts him off from all .
My gracious Husband , you must now prepare , In all your Graces pomp to entertainYour Cosin , who is now a convertite , And follows here , this night he will be here .
Be ready all in haste , I do intend , To shew before my Cosin 's wondring face , The greatness of my pomp , and of my place. [ Exeunt omnes .
Sirrah , is all things carried to the Tailor ? The measure , and the fashion of the Gown , With the best trim ?
Yes Sir , and 'twill be ready within this two days .
For my self I care not , I have a suit or two of antient Velvet ; Which with some small correcting and addition , May steal into the presence .
Would my Gown were ready ; Husband , I 'll lay my life , To make you something e'r to morrow night .
It must not beBefore we see the Duke , and have advice , How to behave our selves : lets in the while , And keep our selves from knowledge , till time shall call us .

I much admire the fierce masculine spirit , Of this dread Amazon .
This following night I 'll have a wench in solace .
Sir , I hear you , And will be with you if I live , no more .

My Lady would intreat your presence , Gentlemen .
We will obey your Lady , she is worthy .
You , light alone , a word , or two .
Your Will , Sir .
Hark in your ear ; wilt thou be married ? speak , wilt thoumarry ?
Married ? to whom Sir ?
To a proper fellow , landed , and able bodied .
Why do you flout me , Sir ?
I swear I do not ; I love thee for thy Ladies sake , be free ?
If I could meet such matches as you speak of , I were a very child to lose my time , Sir .
What saist thou to Monsieur Bewford ?
Sir , I say he 's a proper Gentleman , and farAbove my means to look at .
Dost thou like him ?
Yes Sir , and ever did .
He is thine own .
You are too great in promises .
Be rul 'd , and follow my advice , he shall be thine .
Would you would make it good , Sir .
Do but thus , Get thee a cushion underneath thy cloaths , And leave the rest to me .
I 'll be your scholar , I can not lose much by the venture sure .
Thou wilt lose a pretty maidenhead , my rogue , Or I am much o'th ' bow hand , you 'll rememberIf all this take effect , who did it for you , And what I may deserve for such a kindness .
Yours Sir. [ Exeunt .
Jaques and Shattillion severally .
Save ye Sir .
Save the King .
I pray you Sir , which is the nearest way .
Save the King , this is the nearest way .
Which is the nearest way to the Post-house ?
God save the King and his Post-house .
I pray Sir direct me to the house .
Heaven save the King , you can not catch me , Sir .
I do not understand you , Sir .
You do not , I say you can not catch me , Sir .
Not catch you , Sir ?
No Sir , nor can the King , With all his stratagems , and his forced tricks , Although he put his Nobles in disguise ; Never so oft to sift into my words , By course of Law , lay hold upon my life .
It is business that my Lord the DukeIs by the King imployed in , and he thinksI am acquainted with it .
I shall not need to rip the cause up , From the first , to you , But if his Majesty had suffer 'd meTo marry her , though she be after him , The right heir general to the Crown of France.I would not have convey 'd her into Spain , As it was thought , nor would I e'er have joyn 'd , With the reformed Churches , to make them , Stand for my cause .
I do not think you would .
I thank you Sir , And since I see you are a favourerOf virtues , kept in bondage ; Tell directly to my soveraign King , For so I will acknowledge him for ever , How you have found my staid affectionsSetled for peace , and for the present state .
Why Sir ?
And good Sir , tell him further this , That notwithstanding all suggestionsBrought to him against me , and all his suspitions , Which are innumerable to my treasons , If he will warrant me but publique trial , I 'll freely yeild my self into his hands ; Can he have more than this ?
No by my troth .
I would his Majesty would hear but reason , As well as you .
But Sir , you do mistake me , For I never saw the King.In all my life but once , therefore good Sir , May it please you to shew me which is the Post-house .
I cry you mercy , Sir , then you are my friend .
Yes Sir .
And such men are very rare with me , The Post-house is hard by , farewel ;
I thank you , Sir , I must ride hard to night , And it is dark already .
I am cruel , to send this man directly to his deathThat is my friend , and I might easily save him , He shall not dye , come back , my friend , come back .
What is your Will ?
Do you not know ?
Not I .
And do you gather nothing by my face ?
No Sir .
Virtue is ever innocent , Lay not the fault on me , I grieve for you , And wish that all my tears might win your safety .
Why Sir ?
Alas good friend you are undone , The more ill fortune , mine to be the meansOf your sad overthrow , you know not me .
No truly Sir .
Would you had never seen me , I am a man pursu 'd by the whole stateAnd sure some one hath seen me talk with you .
Yes , divers Sir .
Why then your head is gone .
I 'll out of town .
Would it were soon enough , Stay if you love your life , or else you are taken .
What shall I do ?
I 'll venture deeply for him , Rather than to cast away an innocent , Take courage friend , I will preserve thy life , With hazard of mine own .
I thank you , Sir .
This night thou shalt be lodg 'd within my doors , Which shall be all lock 'd fast , and in the mornI 'll so provide , you shall have free access , To the Sea-side , and so be shipt away , E'r any know it .
Good Sir , suddainly , I am afraid to dye .
Then follow me. [ Exeunt .
Shatillion 's Love .
This way he went , and there 's the house , I hope , His better Angel hath directed him , To leave the wandring streets , poor Gentleman.Would I were able with as free a heart , To set his soul right , as I am to grieve , The ruine of his fame , which God forgive me ; Sir , if you be within , I pray Sir speak to me .
I am within , and will be ; what are you ?
A friend .
No Sir , you must pardon me , I am acquainted with none such : be speedy , Friend , there is no other remedy .
A word Sir , I say , I am your friend .
You can not scape by any other means , Be not fearful , God save the King , What 's your business , Sir ?
To speak with you .
Speak out then .
Shall I not come up ?
Thou shalt not : flie if thou be'st thine own friend , There lies the suit and all the furnitureBelonging to the head , on with it friend .
Sir do you hear ?
I do , God bless the King , It was a habit I had laid aside , For my own person , if the state had forced me .
Good Sir , unlock your door .
Be full of speed , I see some 20 Musquetiers in ambushWhate'r thou art , know I am here and will be , Seest thou this bloody sword that cries revenge ? Shake not my friend , through millions of these foesI 'll be thy guard , and set thee safe aboard .
Dare you not trust me , Sir ?
My good sword before me , And my allegeance to the King I tell theeCaptain ( for so I ghess thee by thy Arms ) And the loose flanks of Halberdiers about thee , Thou art too weak , and foolish to attempt me.If you be ready , follow me , and hark youUpon your life speak to no living wight , Except my self .
Monsieur Shattillion ?
Thou shalt not call agen ; thus with my sword , And the strong faith I bear unto the King ; Whom God preserve , I will de [ sc ] end my chamber , And cut thy throat , I swear I 'll cut thy throat , Steal after me and live .
I will not stay.The fury of a man so far distracted. [ Exit Love .
Shattillion.Where 's the Officer that dares not enter , To intrap the life of my distressed friend ? I , have you hid your self ? you must be found , What do you fear ? is not authority on your sideNay , I know the Kings commandWill be your warrant , why then fear you ? speakWhat strange designs are these ? Shattillion , Be resolute and bear thy self upright , Though the whole world despise thee : soft , methinks.I heard a rushing which was like the shakeOf a discovered Officer , I 'll searchThe whole street over , but I 'll find thee out. [ Exit .
Jaques in womans apparel .
How my joynts do shake , where had I beenBut for this worthy Gentleman , thatHath some touch of my infortunes ; would I wereSafe under hatches once , for Callicut , Farewel the pomp of Court , I never moreCan hope to be a Duke or any thing , I never more shall see the glorious faceOf my fair spreading Lord that lov 'd me well .
Shattillion .
Fly you so fast ? I had a sight of you , But would not follow you ; I was too wise , You shall not lead me with a cunning trick ; Where you may catch me ; poor Shattillion ; Hath the Kings anger left thee never a friend ? No , all mens loves move by the breath of Kings .
It is the Gentleman that sav 'd my life , Sir .
Bless Shattillion , another plot .
No Sir , 't is I .
Why , who are you ?
Your friend whom you preserv 'd .
Whom I preserv 'd ? My friend ? I have no woman friend but one , Who is too close in prison to be here ; Come near , let me look on you .
'T is I .
You should not be a woman by your stature .
I am none , Sir .
I know it , then keep off , Strange men and times ! how I am still preserv 'd ! Here they have sent a yeoman of the guard , Disguis 'd in womans clothes , to work on me , To make love to me ; and to trap my words , And so insnare my life , I know you , Sir , Stand back , upon your peril , can this beIn Christian Common-weals , from this time forthI 'll cut off all the means to work on me , I 'll ne'er stir from my house : and keep my doorsLockt day and night , and cheapen meat and drinkAt the next shops by Signs , out of my window , And having bought it , draw it up in my garters .
Sir , will you help me ?
Do not follow me , I 'll take a course to live , despight of men. [ Exit Shat .
He dares not venture for me , wretched Jaques ! Thou art undone for ever and for ever , Never to rise again ? what shall I do ?
Bewfort.Where shall I hide me ? here 's one to take me , I must stand close , and not speak for my life .
This is the time of night , and this the haunt , In which I use to catch my Wastcoatiers , It is not very dark , no , I shall spie 'em , I have walk't out in such a pitchy night.I could not see my fingers this far off , And yet have brought home venison by the smell , I hope they have not left their old walk , ah ? Have I spied you sitting by this light ? To me there 's no such fine sight in the world , As a white apron 'twixt twelve and one ; See how it glisters ! do you think to scape ? See now I have you fast ; come , and do not strive , It takes away the edge of appetite ; Come , I 'll be liberal every way.Take heed you make no noise , for waking of the Watch. [ Exeunt .
Now the blessing of some happy guide , To bring us to the Duke , and we are ready .
Long. and Servant.Come forward , see the door is open 'd , And two of his Gent. I 'll speak to them , And mark how I behave my self , God save ye ; For less I can not wish to men of sort , and of your seeming : Are you of the Dukes ?
We are , Sir , and your servants , your salutes , We give you back again with many thanks .
When did you hear such words before Wife ? peace , Do you not dare to answer yet ; is't fitSo mean a Gentleman as my self should crave , The presence of the great Duke your Master ?
Sir you may .
Shall we desire your name , and business , Sir ? And we will presently inform him of you .
My name is Cleremont .
You are his Graces kinsman , Or I am much mistaken ?
You are right , Some of his noble bloud runs through these veins , Though far unworthy of his graces knowledge .
Sir , we must all be yours ; his graces kinsman , And we so much forgetful ? 't was a rudeness , And must attend your pardon , thus I crave it : First to this beauteous Lady , whom I takeTo be your Wife , Sir , next your mercy .
You have it , Sir , I do not like this kissing , It lies so open to a world of wishes .
This is the merry fellow ; this is heThat must be noble too .
And so he shall.If all the Art I have can make him noble , I 'll dub him with a Knight-hood ; if his wifeWill be but forward , and joyn issue , I like her above excellent .
Wil't please youTo walk a turn or two , whilst to the DukeWe make your comming known ? [ Exit Serv. and Long .
I shall attend , Sir .
These Gentlemen are very proper men , And kiss the best that e'er I tasted.For goodness-sake husband , let us never moreCome near the Countrey , whatsoe'er betide us ; I am in malice with the memoryOf that same stinking dung-hil .
Why now you are my chicken and my dear , Love where I love , hate where I hate : nowYou shall have twenty Gowns , and twenty Chains , See , the door is opening .
Room afore there , the Duke is entring .
, Wife , Long. Servant , Maria .
'T is the Duke , even he himself , be merry , This is the golden age the Poet speaks on .
I pray it be not brazen 'd by their faces , And yet methinks they are the neatest PiecesFor shape , and cutting that e'er I beheld .
Most gracious Duke , my poor Spouse and my self , Do kiss your mighty foot , and next to thatThe great hand of your Dutchess , ever wishingYour honors ever springing , and your years .
Cosin ?
Your Graces vassal , far unworthyThe nearness of your blood .
Correct me not , I know the word I speak , And know the person.Though I be something higher than the placeWhere common men have motion , and descendingDown with my eye , their forms are lessened to me ; Yet from this pitch can I behold my own , From millions of those men that have no mark , And in my fearful stoop , can make them stand , When others feel my feet , and perish : Cosin , Be comforted , you are very welcome , soIs your fair Wife : the charge of whom I giveTo my own dearest , and best beloved.Tell me , you have resolv 'd your self for Court , And utterly renounc 'd the slavish Countrey , With all the cares thereof ?
I have , Sir .
Have you dismist your eating houshold , Sold your hangings of Nebuchadnezar , for such they were , As I remember , with the FurnituresBelonging to your Beds and Chambers ?
I Sir .
Have you most carefully ta'en off the Lead , From you [ r ] roof , weak with age , and so preventedThe ruin of your house , and clapt himIn a summer suit of thatch to keep him cool ?
All this I have perform 'd .
Then lend me all your hands , I will embrace my CosinWho is an understanding Gentleman , And with a zeal mighty , as is my name , Once more I bid you welcome to the Court ; My state again .
As I was telling you , your HusbandMust be no more Commander , look to that , Be several at meat , and lodging , let him haveBoard-wages , and Diet , 'mongst his men i'th ' TownFor pleasure , if he be given to't , let him have it , Else as your own fancy shall direct you.Cosin , you see this mighty man here : he was an assWhen he came first to Town : indeed he wasJust such another coxcomb as your Husband , God bless the mark , and every good mans child ! This must not stir you Cosin .
Heaven forbid !
Sweet Maria ; provide the cushion ready for it .
It shall be done .
Receive all your advices from our self , Be once a day with us , and so farewelFor this time , my fair Cosin , GentlemenConduct him to his Lodging .
Farewel , and think upon my words .
I shall observe them. [ Exit Duke and Duchess .
Health , and the Kings continual love , attend you .
Oh for a private place to ease my Lungs ! Heaven give me patience , such a pair of jadesWere never better ridden to this hour , Pray heaven they hold out to the journeys end .
Twitch him aside good Monsieur , whilst I breakUpon the body of his strength , his wife , I have a constant promise : she is my own .
Ply her to wind-ward Monsieur , you have takenThe most compendious way to raise your self , That could have been delivered by a Counsel .
I have some certain aims , Sir : but my wife --
Your wife , you must not let that trouble you .
It will Sir , to see her in a strangers arms .
What mean you ? let her alone , be wise , stir not a footFor if you do , all your hopes are buried : I swear you are a lost man if you stir .
I thank you Sir , I will be more advis 'd .
But what great Office do you level at ?
Sir , they are kissing .
Let them kiss , And much may do their good hearts ; they must kissAnd kiss , and double kiss , and kiss again , Or you may kiss the post for any rising : Had your noble kinsman ever mountedTo these high Spheres of honor , now he moves in , But for the kisses of his wife ?
I know not .
Then I do ; credit me , he had been lost , A fellow of no mark , and no repute.Had not his wife kist soon , and very sweetly : She was an excellent woman , and dispatcht himTo his full being , in a moment , Sir -- [ Exit Long. and Wife .
But yet methinks he [ sh ] ould not take her , Sir , Into a private room .
Now stand and flourish , You are a mad [ e ] man for ever.I do envy you if you stand your fortunes up , You are the happiest man , but your great Cosin , This day in Court : well , I will marry surely , And not let every man out-run me thus.'Tis time to be mine own friend , I liveIn town here , and direct the readiest way , To other men , and be a slave my self .
Nay , good Sir be not mov 'd , I am your servant , And will not be ungrateful for this knowledge .
Will you be walking home ?
I would desire to have my wife along .
You are too raw , Begone , and take no notice where you left her , Let her return at leasure , if she stayA month , 'twill be the better , understand meThis Gentleman can do't. [ Exit Cosin .

Oh come in , I 'll find a time for you too , be not loud .
Sir , you have found that time already , shameOn my soul therefore .
Why ? what 's the matter ?
Do you not see , Sir , is your light so dim ?
Do you not wait on the Lady Mount Marine ?
I do Sir , but my love on you .
Poor soul ! how cam'st thou by this big belly ?
By your self .
By heaven I ne'er touch 'd your body .
Yes , unswear that oath again , I 'll tell you all ; These two years I have lov 'd you , but the meansHow to enjoy you , I did never knowTill Twelf-night last , when hearing of your gameTo take up wenches private in the night , I apprehended straight this course to makeMy self as one of them , and wait your coming ; I did so , and enjoyed you , and now this childThat now is quick within me , hide my shame , And marry me , or else I must be forc 'd --

Are you a bed ?
No Sir , the hangings .

Nay Monsieur , I 'll forbid that , we 'll have fair play , Lend me your candle , are you taken Bewford ? A lecher of your practice , and close carriageTo be discovered thus ? I am asham'dSo great a master in his art should fail , And stagger in his grounds .
You 're wide , This woman and my self are man and wife , And have been so this half year , Where are you now ? have I been discover 'd ? You can not break so easily on me , Sir , I am too wary to be open 'd by you .
But these are but illusions , to give colourTo your most mystick leachery , but Sir , The belly hath betraid you all , it must out .
Good Longaveil believe me on my faith , I am her husband .
On my faith I can not , unless I sawYour hands fast , and your hearts .
Why Longavile , when did I give that to your ears , That was not truth ? by all the world she 's mine , She is my wife , and to confirm you betterI give my self again , here take my handAnd I yours , we are once more married , Will this content you ?
Yes I am believing , and God give you joy .
My loving wife , I will not wrong thee , Since I am thine and only loved of theeFrom this hour I vow my self a new man , Be not jealous : for though I had a purpose , To have spent an hour or two in solace otherwise , And was provided for it , yet my loveShall put a better temper to my blood , Come out thou woman of unwholsome life , Be sorry for thy sins , and learn to mend , Nay , never hide your face , you shall be seen .
Jaques , why Jaques , art thou that Jaques , The very staffe , and right hand of our Duke ? Speak , thou bearded Venus .
I am he , by miracle preserv 'd to be that Jaques , Within this two hours Gentlemen , poor JaquesWas but as coarse in grave : a man of wisdom , That of my conscience , if he had his rightShould have a pretty State , but that 's all oneThat Noble Gentleman did save this life , I keep it for him , 't is his own .
Oh Bacchus ! is all the world drunk ? come we 'll to the DukeAnd give thanks for this delivery .
Jaques .
Not gone unto my Tenants to relateMy Grace and Honor ; [ and ] the mightinessOf my new name , which would have struck a terrorThrough their course doublets , to their very hearts ?
Alas , great Lord and Master , I could scarceWith safety of my life return againUnto your graces house , and but for oneThat had some mercy , I had sure been hang 'd .
My house ?
Yes Sir , this house , your house i ' th ' Town .
Jaques we are displeas 'd , hath it no name ?
What name ?
Dull rogue ; what hath the King bestow'dSo many honors , open 'd all his springs , And show'red his graces down upon my head , And has my house no name ? no title yet ?
house you ass .
Your graces mercy , when I was come off , and had recover 'd
house , I durst not yet be seen , But lay all night for fear of pursevantsIn Burgundy privie house .
Oh Sir , 't is well , Can you remember now ? but Jaques knowSince thy intended journey is so crost , I will go down my self this morning .
Sir ?
Have I not said this morning ?
But consider , That nothing is prepared yet for your journey , Your graces teams not here to draw your cloaths ; And not a Carrier yet in town to send by .
I say once more go about it , You 're a wise man , you 'd have me linger time , Till I have worn these cloaths out : will ye go ? [ Ex. Jaq.Make ye ready Wife .
I am so , mighty Duke .
Nay , for the Countrey .
How ? for the Countrey ?
Yes I am resolv 'd to see my Tenants in this bravery , Make them a sumptuous feast , with a slight shew , Of Dives and Lazarus , and a squib or two , And so return .
Why Sir ? you are not mad ?
How many Dukes have ye known mad ? I pray speak .
You are the first , Sir , and I hope the last , But you are stark horn-mad .
Forbear good wife .
As I have faith you 're mad : your hornsHave been too heavy for you , and have brokeYour skull in pieces : If you be in earnest .
Well , you shall know my skull and wits are wholeE'r I have done , and yet I am in earnest .
Why , do you think I 'll go ?
I know you shall .
I shall ? by what authority shall I ?
I am your Husband .
True , I confess it , And by that name , the world hath given youA power to sway me ; but Sir , you shall knowThere is a greater bond that ties me here , Allegeance to the King , has he not heaptThose honors on you to no other end , But to stay you here , and shall I have a handIn the offending such a gracious Prince ? Besides , our own undoings lies upo n't , Were there no other cause , I do not see , Why you should go : If I should say you should not .
Do you think so ?
Yes faith .
Now good wife make me understand that point .
Why that you shall , did I not bring you hither ?
Yes .
And were not all these honors wrought out of the fire by me ?
By you ?
By me ? how strange you make it ! When you came first , did you not walk the Town , In a long Cloak half compass ? an old Hat , Lin 'd with Vellure , and on it for a band , A skein of crimson Cruil ?
I confess it .
And took base courses ?
Base ?
Base , by this light , extream base , and scurvie , monstrous base .
What were these courses , wife ?
Why , you shall know , Did you not thus attir 'd , trot up and down , Plotting for vild and lowsie Offices , And agreed with the Sergeant of the Bears , To buy his place ? deny this , if you can .
Why it is true .
And was not that monstrous base ?
Be advis 'd wife , a Bear 's a Princely beast .
A Bear ?
Yes wife , and one side venison .
You 're more than one side fool , [ I 'm ] sure of that .
But since you have vext me wife , know you shall go ; Or you shall never have penny from me .
Nay , I have done , and though I know 'twill beYour overthrow , I 'll not forsake you now .
Be ready then. [ Exit Duke .
I will .

What are you married Bewford ?

Oh Gentlemen , we are undone .
For what ?
This Gentleman , the Lord of Lor [ n ] e , my Husband , Will be gone down to shew his play-fellowsWhere he is gay .
What , down into [ the ] Countrey ?
Yes faith , was ever fool but he so cross ? I would as fain be gracious to him , As he could wish me , but he will not let me ; Speak faithfully , will he deserve my mercy ?
According to his merits he should wear , A guarded coat , and a great wooden dagger .
If there be any woman that doth know , The duties 'twixt a Husband and his wife , Will speak but one word for him , he shall scape ; Is not that reasonable ? but there 's none , Be ready therefore , to pursue the plotWe had against a pinch , for he must stay .
Wait you here for him , whilst I goeAnd make the King acquainted with your sport , For fear he be incens 'd for our attemptingPlaces of so great honor. [ Exit Long .
Go , be speedy .
, Cosin , Wife , Jaques , Man .
Come let me see how all things are dispos 'd of .
One Cart will serve for all your furniture , With room enough behind to ease the Footman , A capcase for you [ r ] linnen , and your plate , With a strange lock that opens with Amen , For my young Lord , because of easie portage , A quiver of your graces lin 'd with Cunney , Made to be hang 'd about the Nurses neck , Thus , with a Scarfe or Towel .
Very good .
Nay , 't is well , but had you staid another week , I would have had you furnisht , in such pomp , As never Duke of Burgundy was furnisht , You should have had a Sumpter , though 't had cost meThe laying on my self , where now you are fain , To hire a Rippers mare , and buy new dossers , But I have got them painted with your Arms , With a fair darnex Carpet of my ownLaid cross for the more state .
Jaques I thank you : your Carpet shall be brushtAnd sent you home ; what , are you ready wife ?
An hour ago .
I can not chuse but kiss thy royal Lips , Dear Duchess mine , thou art so good a woman .
Youl 'd say so if you knew all , goodman Duckling .
This was the happiest fortune could befal meNow in his absence will I follow closeMine own preferment , and I hope e'r long , To make my mean and humble name so strong , As my great Cosins , when the world shall know , I bear too hot a spirit to live low.The next Spring will I down , my wife and houshold , I 'll have my Ushers , and my four Lacquies , Six spare Caroches too , but mum , no more , What I intend to do , I 'll keep in store .
Mountey , mountey , Jaques , be our Querry .
To horse there Gentlemen , and fall in couples .
Come honoured Duchess .
Longavile .
Stand thou proud man .
Thieves , Jaques , raise the people .
No , raise no people , 't is the Kings command , Which bids thee once more stand , thou haughty man , Thou art a monster , for thou art ungrateful , And like a fellow of a rebel nature , Hast flung from his embraces : and forHis honors given thee , hast not return'dSo much as thanks , and to oppose his Will , Resolv 'd to leave the Court , and set the RealmA fire , in discontent , and open action : Therefore he bids thee stand , thou proud man , Whilst with the whisking of my sword about , I take thy honors off : this first sad whiskTakes off thy Dukedom , thou art but an Earl .
You are mistaken , Longavile .
Oh would I were : this second whisk dividesThy Earldom from thee , thou art yet a Baron .
No more whisks if you love me Longavile .
Two whisks are past , and two are yet behind , Yet all must come , but not to linger time.With these two whisks I end , now mount Marine , For thou art now no more , so says the King , And I have done his Highness Will with grief .
Degraded from my honors ?
'T is too certain .
I am no Traitor sure , that I know of ; Speak Jaques , hast thou ever heard me utter wordTending to Treason , or to bring in the enemy ?
Alas Sir , I know nothing , Why should your Worship bring me in to hang me ? [ God 's my judge Gentlemen ] I never medledBut with the brushing of his cloaths , or fetchingIn water in a morning for his hands .
Are these the honors of this place ? AnthonyHelp me to take her Gown off quickly , Or I 'll so swinge ye for't --
Why Husband ? Sir ?
I 'll not loose a penny by this town .
Why what do you mean , Sir , have her to her lodging , And there undress her , I will wait upon her .
Indeed you shall not , your month is out I take it , Get you out before me wife : Cosin farewel , I told you long agoe , That pride begins with pleasure , ends with woe. [ Exit with 's Wife .
Goe thy way sentences , 'twill be thy fortune , To live and dye a Cuckold , and Churchwarden .
Oh my poor Husband ! what a heavy fortuneIs fallen upon him !
Methinks 't is strange , That heaven fore-warning great men of their falls , With such plain tokens , they should not avoid 'em : For the last night betwixt eleven and twelve , Two great and hideous blazing stars were seenTo fight a long hour by the clock , the oneDrest like a Duke , the other like a King ; Till at the last the crowned Star o'er-came .
Why do ye stand so dead , Monsieur Marine ?
So Cæsar fell , when in the CapitolThey gave his body two and thirty wounds.Be warned all ye Peers , and by my fall , Hereafter learn to let your wives rule all .
Monsieur Marine , pray let me speak with you ; Sir , I must wave you to conceal this party , It stands upon my utter overthrow ; Seem not discontented , nor do not stir afoot , For if you do , you and your hope -- I swear you are a lost man if you stir.And have an eye to Bewford , he 'll tempt you .
Come , come , for shame go down ; Were I Marine , [ by heaven ] I would go down : And being there , I would rattle him such an answerShould make him smoke .
Good Monsieur Bewford , peaceLeave these rebellious words , Or by the honors which I once enjoyed , And yet may swear by , I 'll tell the King of your proceedings ; I am satisfied .
You talkt of going down when 't was not fit , But now let 's see your spirit , A thousand and a thousand will expect it .
Why wife , are ye mad ?
No , nor drunk , but I 'd have you know your own strength .
You talke like a most foolish woman , wife ; I tell you I will stay , yet I have aCrotchet troubles me .
More crotchets yet ?
Follow me Jaques , I must have thy counsel , I will return again , stay you there wife .
I fear this loss of honor will give him some few stools .
No , no , he is resolv 'd , he will notStir a foot , I 'll lay my life .
I , but he 's discontented , how shall we resolve that , And make him stay with comfort ?
Faith Bewford we must even let nature work , For he 's the sweetest temper 'd man for thatAs one can wish , for let men but go about to fool him , And he 'll have his finger as deep i n't as the best ; But see where he comes frowning , bless us all !
Off with your hats , for here doth comeThe high and mighty Duke of Burgundy.What ever you may think , I have thoughtAnd thought , and thought upo n't , and I find it plain , The King can not take back what he has given , Unless I forfeit it by course of Law.Not all the water in the River Seine , Can wash the blood out of these Princely veins .
God-a-mercy Husband , thou art the bestTo work out a thing at a pinch in France .
I will ascend my State again , Duchess , take your place , And let our Champion enter .
Has he his Champion ? that 's excellent .
And let loud Musick sound before his entrance.Sound Trumpet .
Jaques in Armor , one carrying a Scutcheon beforehim , and a two-handed Sword .
How well our Champion doth demean himself , As if he had been made for such an action ? Methinks his sturdy truncheon he doth weild , Like Mars approaching to a bloody field .
I think there 's no man so desperateTo dare encounter with our Champion , But trust me , Jaques , thou hast pleas 'd us well ; Once more our warlike Musick , then proceed .
Shattillion .
What wondrous age is this ! what close proceedings ! I hear the clang of Trumpets in this house , To what intent do not our States-men search ? Oh no , they look not into simple truth ; For I am true , and they regard not me , A man in Armor too : God save the King , The world will end , there 's nought but treachery .
I Jaques , servant to the high and mighty Godfrey , Duke of Burgundy , do come hither to prove by naturalstrength , and activity of my body , without the help of sorcery , inchantment , or negromancy , that the said Godfrey , late of Mount Marine , and now of Burgundy , hath perfectright thereto , notwithstanding the Kings command to thecontrary , and no other person whatsoever : and in tokenthat I will be ready to make good the same : I throw downmy gage , which is my honor , pronounced the 37 of Feb.Stilo novo , God save the Duke .
Of all the plots the King hath laid for meThis was the shrewdest , 't is my life they seekAnd they shall have it : if I should refuseTo accept the challenge in the Kings behalf , They have some cause to take away my life , And if I do accept it , who can tell , But I may fall by doubtful chance of War ? 'T was shrew 'd , but I must take the least of evils , I take thy gauntlet up , thou treacherous man , That stands in armed Coat against the King.Whom God preserve , and with my single sword , Will justifie whatever he commands ; I 'll watch him for catching of my words .
Jaques go on , defend our Princely Title .
Why shrink'st thou back ? thou hast an evil cause ; Come forward man , I have a rock about me , I fight for my true Liege .
Go forward Jaques .
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me , I will not fight with him , with any elseI 'll shew my resolution speedily .
Come , do thy worst , for the King shall seeAll is not true , that is reported of me .
I may not fight with him by Law of Arms .
What ? shall my Title fall ? wilt thou not fight ?
Never with him that once hath sav 'd my life .
Dar'st thou not fight ? behold then , I do goStrong with the zeal I bear my Sovereign , And seize upon that haughty man himself.Descend the steps ( that thou hast thus usurp'dAgainst the King and State , ) down to the ground , And if thou do utter but a syllableTo cross the Kings intent , thou art but dead ; There , lye upon the earth , and pine , and dye.Did ever any man wade through such stormsTo save his life , as poor Shattillion ?
I fear this challenge hath spoil 'd all .
Ne'er fear it , he 'll work it out again , servant.See where Shattillion 's Love , poor Lady , comes .
Lie still , Sir , if you love your life , I 'll whistle when he'sgone,
Oh Gentlemen , I charge you by the LoveWhich you bear to women , take some pittyOn this distressed man , help to restoreThat precious Jewel to him he hath lost .
Lady , what ever power doth lie in usBy Art , or Prayer , or danger , we are yours .
A strange conceit hath wrought this malady , Conceits again must bring him to himself , My strict denial to his Will wrought this : And if you could but draw his wilder thoughtsTo know me , he would sure recover sense .
That charge I 'll undertake .
Look Jaques , look , for Gods sake let me rise , This greatness is a jade , I can not sit it .
His sword is up , and yet he watcheth you .
I 'll down again , pray for thy Master , Jaques .
Now the King may see all the suggestions are not true , He hath receiv 'd against my loyalty ; When all men else refuse , I fight his battels , And thrust my body into dangers mouth ; I am become his Champion , and this swordHas taught his enemies to know themselves ; Oh that he would no more be jealous of me !
Monsieur Shattillion , the King ass [ ign ] s you , That for this valiant loyal act of yours , He hath forgot all jealousies and fears , And never more will tempt you into danger .
But how shall I believe this , what new tokenOf reconcilement will he shew me ? Let him release my poor Love from her torment , From her hard fare , and strict imprisonment .
He hath done this to win your after-love , And see your Lady sent you from the KingBy these two Gentlemen : be thankful for her .
She lives , she lives , I know her by the powerShoots from her eyes .
Rise dear Shattillion .
I know my duty , Next unto my King , I am to kneel to you .
I 'll have you rise , fetch me a chair , sit down Shat .
I am commanded , and faith tell me Mistriss , What usage have you had ? pray be plain !
Oh my most lov 'd Shattillion , pain enough , But now I am free , thanks to my God and King .
His eyes grow very heavy , not a word , That his weak senses may come sweetly home .
The King is honourable .
When do you whistle Jaques ?
By and by .
Come hither Monsieur , canst thou laugh a little ?
Yes Sir .
So thou shalt then. Bewford , how dost thou ?
Why well .
I 'm glad o n't , and how does thy wife ?
Why , you may see her , Sir , she stands behind you .
By the mass she 's there indeed , but where 's her belly ?
Belly ?
Her great belly , man ; what hast thou sent thee ?
A Boy , I 'll lay my life , it tumbled so .
Catcht by this light .
I 'll be a Gossip Bewford .
And I .
I have an odd Apostle spoon .
S'foot , catcht .
Why , what 's the matter , Gentlemen ?
He 's married to your woman .
And I not know it ?
'T was a venial sin .
Gall , gall , gall .
Forgive her , Monsieur Bewford , 't was her love .
You may rise if you please , I must endure it .
See how my great Lord lies upon the groundAnd dare not stir yet !
whistles ?
Jaques , Jaques , is the Kings Champion gon yet ?
No , but he 's asleep .
Is he asleep art sure ?
I am sure he is , I hear him snore .
Then by your favours Gentlemen I rise , And know I am a Duke still .
And I am his Champion .
Hold thee there , and all France can not mend thee .
I am a Prince as great within my thoughtsAs when the whole state did adorn my person ; What trial can be made to try a Prince ? I will [ o ] ppose this noble corps of mineTo any danger that may end the doubt .
Great Duke , and Husband , there is but one wayTo satisfie the world of our true right , And it is dangerous .
What may it be ? Were it to bring the great Turk bound in chainsThrough France in triumph : or to couple upThe Sophie , and great Prestor John together , I would attempt it Duchess , tell the course .
There is a strong opinion through the world , And no doubt , grounded on experience , That Lions will not touch a lawful Prince , If you be confident then of your right , Amongst the Lions bear your naked body , And if you come off clear , and never winch , The world will say you are a perfect Prince .
I thank you Duchess , for your kind advice , But now we do not affect those ravenous beasts .
A Lion is a beast to try a King ; But for the trial of such a state like this
reports a mastive dog will serve .
We will not deal with dogs at all , but men .
You shall not need to deal with them at all , Hark you Sir , the King doth know you are a Duke:
No , does he ?
Yes , and is content you shall be , but with this caution , That none know it but your self : For if ye do , he 'll take it away by Act of Parliament .
Here 's my hand , and whilst I live or breath , No living wight shall know I am a Duke .
Mark me directly , Sir , your wife may know it .
May not Jaques .
Yes , he may .
May not my Countrey Cosin ?
By no means , Sir , if you love your life and state .
Well then , know all , I am no Duke .
No , I 'll swear it .
See , he wakes .
Where am I , or where have I been all this while ? Sleep hath not sate so sound upon mine eyesBut I remember well that face ; Oh thou too cruel , leave at length to scornHim that but looking on thy beauty , dies , Either receive me , or put out my eyes .
Dearest Shattillion , see upon my knees , I offer up my love , forget my wrongs .
Art thou mine own ?
By heaven I am .
Then all the world is mine .
I have stranger things to tell thee , my dearest love .
Tell nothing , but that thou art mine own : I do not care to know where I have been , Or how I have liv 'd , or any thing , But that thou art my own .
Well wife , though 'twere a trick that made us wed , We 'll make our selves merry soon in bed .
Know all , I am no Duke .
What [ saye ] ?
Jaques ?
Sir .
I am a Duke .
Are ye ?
Yes faith , yes faith.But it must only run among our selves , And Jaques , thou shalt be my Secretary still .
Kind Gentlemen , lead in Shattillion , For he must needs be weak and sickly yet.Now all my labours have a perfect end , as I could wish , Let all young sprightly wives that haveDull foolish coxcombs to their Husbands , Learn by me their duties , what to do , Which is , to make 'em fools , and please 'em too.

Philocles and Lisander .
Make way for my Lord Protector .
Your graces servants .
Cassander , and Lisimachus .
I like your diligent waiting , where 's Lisimachus ?
I wait upon you , Sir .
The Queen looks pleasantThis morning , does she not ?
I ever foundHer gracious smiles on me .
She does consultHer safety i n't , for I must tell thee boy , But in the assurance of her love to thee , I should advance thy hopes another way , And use the power I have in Epire , toSettle our own , and uncontrouled greatness ; But since she carries her self so fairly , I am content to expect , and by her marriageSecure thy fortune , that 's all my ambitionNow , be still careful in thy applicationsTo her , I must attend other affairs , Return , and use what Art thou canst to layMore charms of love upon her .
I presumeShe always speaks the language of her heart , And I can be ambitious for no moreHappiness on earth , than she encouragesMe to expect .
It was an act becomingThe wisdom of her Father to engageA tye between our Families , and sheHath play 'd her best discretion to allow it ; But we lose time in conference , wait on her , And be what thou wert born for , King of Epire , I must away. [ Exit .
Success ever attend you.Is not the Queen yet coming forth ?
Your servant , You may command our duties , This is the Court Star , Philocles .
The Star that we must sail by .
All must borrowA light from him , the young Queen directs allHer favours that way .
He 's a noble Gentleman , And worthy of his expectations : Too good to be the son of such a Father .
Peace , remember he is Lord Protector .
We have more need of Heavens ProtectionI ' th ' mean time , I wonder the old KingDid in his life , design him for the office .
He might expect his faith , I have heard whenThe King , who was no Epirote , advanc'dHis claim , Cassander , our Protector now , Young then , oppos 'd him toughly with his faction , But forc 'd to yield , had fair conditions , And was declar 'd by the whole State , next heir ; If the King wanted issue , our hopes onlyThriv 'd in this daughter .
Whom but for her smilesAnd hope of marriage with Lisimachus , His Father , by some cunning , had remov'dE'r this .
Take heed , the Arras may have earsI should not weep much if his grace would henceRemove to Heaven .
I prethee what should he do there ?
Some Offices will fall .
And the Skie too , e'r I get one stair higherWhile he 's in place .
Antigonus .
Lisander , Philocles , How looks the day upon us ? where 's the Queen ?
In her bed-chamber .
Who was with her ?
None but the young Lord Lisimachus .
'T is no treasonIf a man wish himself a CourtierOf such a possibility : he hasThe mounting fate .
I would his Father wereMounted to th ' gallows .
He has a path fair enough , If he survive by title of his Father .
The Queen will hasten his ascent .
Would I were Queen .
Thou wou'dst become rarely the petticoat , What wou'dst thou do ?
Why , I wou 'd marryMy Gentleman usher , and trust all the strengthAnd burden of my State upon his legs , Rather than be call 'd wife by any sonOf such a Father .
Come , let 's leave this subject , We may find more secure discourse ; when sawYou young Arcadius , Lord Macarius 's Nephew ?
There 's a spark , a youth moulded for a Favourite , The Queen might do him honor .
Favourite , 't is too cheap a name , there were a matchNow for her Virgin blood .
Must every manThat has a handsome face or leg , feed such
He has a nimble soul , and gives great hopeTo be no woman-hater , dances handsomly , Can court a Lady powerfully , but more goesTo th ' making of a Prince. He 's hereAnd 's Uncle .
Arcadius , Macarius , Seleucus .
Save you Gentlemen , who can direct meTo find my Lord Protector ?
He was hereWithin this half hour , young LisimachusHis Son is with the Queen .
There let him compliment , I have other business , ha , Arcadius ! [ Exit .
Observ 'd you , with what eyes ArcadiusAnd he saluted , their two familiesWill hardly reconcile .
Seleucus carriesHimself too roughly ; with what pride and scornHe past by 'em .
Th'other with less shewOf anger , carries pride enough in 's soul , I wish 'em all at peace , Macarius looksAre without civil war , a good old man , The old King lov 'd him well , Seleucus FatherWas as dear to him , and maintain 'd the characterOf an honest Lord through Epire : that two menSo lov 'd of others , should be so unwelcomeTo one another .
The Queen was not wont to send for me .
The reason 's to her self , It will become your duty to attend her .
Save you Gentlemen , what noveltyDoes the Court breathe to day ?
None Sir , the newsThat took the last impression is , that youPurpose to leave the Kingdom , and those men , That honor you , take no delight to hear it .
I have ambition to see the differenceOf Courts , and this may spare ; the delightsAt home do surfet , and the Mistriss , whomWe all do serve , is fixt upon one object , Her beams are too much pointed , but no CountreyShall make me lose your memories .
, Lisimachus , Macarius , Charilla .
Arcadius .
Your Lordship honor 'd me , I have no blessing in his absence .
'T is done like a pious Uncle .
We must notGive any licence .
If your MajestyWould please .
We are not pleas 'd , it had become your duty , To have first acquainted us , e'r you declar'dYour resolution publick , is our CourtNot worth your stay ?
I humbly beg your pardon .
Where 's Lysimachus ?
Your humble servant , Madam .
We shall findEmployment at home for you , do not lose us .
Madam , I then write my self blest on earthWhen I may do you service .
We would be private , Macarius .
Madam , you have blest me , Nothing but your command could interpose toStay him .
Lisimachus , You must not leave us .
Nothing but Lisimachus ? has she notTa'en a philter ?
Nay , pray be cover 'd , Ceremony from you , Must be excus 'd .
It will become my duty .
Not your love ? I know you would not have me look uponYour person as a Courtier , not as Favorite ; That Title were too narrow to expressHow we esteem you .
The least of allThese names from you , Madam , is grace enough .
Yet here you wou 'd not rest ?
Not if you please : To say there is a happiness beyond , And teach my ambition how to make it mine , Although the honors you already haveLet fall upon your servant , exceed allMy merit ; I have a heart is studiousTo reach it with desert , and make i [ f ] possibleYour favor 's mine by justice , with your pardon .
We are confident this needs no pardon , Sir , But a reward to cherish your opinion , And that you may keep warm your passion , Know we resolve for marriage , and ifI had another gift , beside my self , Greater , in that you should discern , how muchMy heart is fixt .
Let me digest my blessing .
But I can not resolve when this shall be .
How Madam ? do not make me dream of Heaven , And wake me into misery , if your purposeBe , to immortalize your humble servant , Your power on earth 's divine , Princes are hereThe copies of Eternity , and create , When they but will our happiness .
I shallBelieve you mock me in this argument , I have no power .
How , no power ?
Not as a Queen .
I understand you not .
I must obey , your Father 's my Protector .
How ?
When I am absolute , Lisimachus , Our power and Titles meet , before , we are butA shadow , and to give you that were nothing .
Excellent Queen , My love took no original from State , Or the desire of other greatness , Above what my birth may challenge modestly , I love your virtues ; mercenary soulsAre taken with advancement , you 've an EmpireWithin you , better than the worlds , to thatLooks my ambition .
T'other is not , Sir , To be despis 'd , Cosmography allows
, a place i ' th ' Map , and know till IPossess what I was born to , and aloneDo grasp the Kingdoms Scepter , I accountMy self divided , he that marries meShall take an [ a ] bsolute Queen to his warm bosom , My temples yet are naked , until thenOur Loves can be but compliments , and wishes , Yet very hearty ones .
I apprehend .
Your Father .
Cassander and Seleucus .
Madam , a Gentleman has an humble suit .
'T is in your power to grant , you are Protector , I am not yet a Queen .
How 's this ?
I shall expound her meaning .
Why kneel you , Sir ?
Madam , to reconcile two familiesThat may unite , both Counsels and their bloodTo serve your Crown .
Macarius , and EubulusThat beare inveterate malice to each other.It grew , as I have heard , upon the questionWhich some of either family had madeWhich of their Fathers was the best Commander : If we believe our stories , they have bothDeserved well of our state , and yet this quarrelHas cost too many lives , a severe faction .
But I 'll propound a way to plant a quietAnd peace in both our houses , which are tornWith their dissentions , and lose the gloryOf their great names , my blood speaks my relationTo Eubulus , and I wish my veins were emptiedTo appease their war .
Thou hast a noble soul , This is a charity above thy youth , And it flows bravely from thee , name the way .
In such a desperate cause , a little streamOf blood might purge the foulness of their heartsIf you 'll prevent a deluge .
Be particular .
Let but your Majesty consent that twoMay with their personal valour , undertakeThe honor of their family , and determineTheir difference .
This rather will inlargeTheir hate , and be a means to call more bloodInto the stream .
Not if both familiesAgree , and swear --
And who shall be the Champions ?
I beg the honor , for Eubulus causeTo be ingag 'd , if any for Macarius , Worthy to wager heart with mine , accept it , I am confident , Arcadius , For honor would direct me to his sword , Will not deny , to stake against my lifeHis own , if you vouchsafe us priviledge .
You are the expectation , and top boughsOf both your houses , it would seem injustice , To allow a civil war to cut you off , And your selves the instruments , besidesYou appear a soldier ; ArcadiusHath no acquaintance yet with rugged war , More fit to drill a Lady , than exposeHis body to such dangers : a small woundI'th ' head , may spoil the method of his hair , Whose curiosity exacts more time , Than his devotion , and who knows but heMay lose his ribond by it in his lock , Dear as his Saint , with whom he would exchangeHis head , for her gay colours ; then his bandMay [ b ] e disorder 'd , and transform 'd from LaceTo Cutwork , his rich cloaths be discomplexionedWith bloud , beside the infashionable slashes : And at the next Festival take Physick , Or put on black , and mourn for his slain breeches : His hands cas 'd up in gloves all night , and sweet
: the next day may be endanger'dTo blisters with a sword , how can he standUpon his guard , who hath Fidlers in his head , To which , his feet must ever be a dancing ? Beside a falsify may spoil his cringe , Or making of a leg , in which consistsMuch of his Court-perfection .
Is this CharacterBestow 'd on him ?
It something may concern the Gentleman , Whom if you please to challengeTo Dance , play on the Lute , or Sing .
Some [ catch ] ?
He shall not want those will maintain himFor any sum .
You are my Sovereign , I dare not think , yet I must speak somewhat , I shall burst else , I have no skill in Jiggs , Nor Tumbling .
How Sir ?
Nor was I born a Minstrel , and in this you haveSo infinitely disgrac 'd Arcadius.But that I have heard another Character , And with your royal Licence do believe it , I should not think him worth my killing .
Your killing ?
Does she not jeer me ; I shall talk treason presently , I find itAt my tongues end already , this is anAffront , I 'll leave her .
Come back , do you know Arcadius ?
I ha ' chang 'd but little breath with him ; our personsAdmit no familiarity ; we wereBorn to live both at distance , yet I ha ' seen himFight , and fight bravely .
When the spirit of WineMade his brain valiant , he fought bravely .
Although he be my enemy , should anyOf the gay flies that buzze about the Court , Sit to catch trouts i'th ' summer , tell me so , I durst in any presence but your own .
What ?
Tell him he were not honest .
I see Sele [ u ] cus , thou art resolute , And I but wrong 'd Arcadius , your firstRequest is granted , you shall fight , and heThat conquers be rewarded , to confirmFirst place and honor to his Family : Is it not this you plead for ?
You are gracious .
Lisimachus .
Madam .
She has granted then ?
With much ado .
I wish thy sword may openHis wanton veins , Macarius is too popular , And has taught him to insinuate .
It shallBut haste the confirmation of our loves , And ripen the delights of marriage , Seleucus. [ Exit cum Sel .
As I guest , It can not be too soon .
To morrow then we crown her , and investMy Son with Majesty , 't is to my wishes , Beget a race of Princes , my Lisimachus .
First , let us marry , Sir .
Thy brow was madeTo wear a golden circle , I 'm transported , Thou shalt rule her , and I will govern thee .
Although you be my Father , that will notConcern my obedience , as I take it .
Philocles , Lisander , and Antigonus.Gentlemen , Prepare your selves for a solemnityWill turn the Kingdom into triumph , EpireLook fresh to morrow , 'twill become your dutiesIn all your glory , to attend the QueenAt her Coronation , she is pleased to makeThe next day happy in our Calendar , My office doth expire , and my old bloodRenews with thought o n't .
How 's this ?
Crown 'd to morrow .
And he so joyful to resign his Regency , There 's some trick i n't , I do not like these hastyProceedings , and whirls of state , they have commonl [ y ] As strange and violent effects ; well , heaven save the Queen .
Heaven save the Queen , say I , and send her a sprightlyBed-fellow , for the Protector , let him pray forHimself , he is like to have no benefit of my devotion .
But this doth quicken my old heart , Lisimachus , There is not any step into her throne , But is the same degree of thy own state ; Come Gentlemen .
We attend your grace .
Lisimachus .
What heretofore could happen to mankindWas with much pain to climb to heaven , but in
marriage of all Queens the best , Heaven will come down to earth , to make me blest. [ Exe .
Arcadius and Polydora .
Indeed you shall not go .
Whither ?
To travel , I know you see me , but to take your leave , But I must never yield to such an absence .
I prethee leave thy fears , I am commandedTo th ' contrary , I wonot leave thee now .
Commanded ? by whom ?
The Queen .
I am very glad , for trust me , I could thinkOf thy departure with no comfort , thouArt all the joy I have , half of my soul , But I must thank the Queen now for thy company , I prethee , what could make thee so desirousTo be abroad ?
Only to get an appetiteTo thee Polidora .
Then you must provoke it .
Nay , prethee do not so mistake thy servant .
Perhaps you surfeit with my Love .
Thy love ?
Although I have no beauty to compareWith the best faces , I have a heart aboveAll competition .
Thou art jealous now , Come let me take the kiss I gave thee last , I am so confident of thee , no LipHas ravisht it from thine ; I prethee comeTo Court .
For what ?
There is the throne for beauty .
'T is safer dwelling here .
There 's none will hurt , Or dare but think an ill to Polydora , The greatest will be proud to honor thee.Thy luster wants the admiration here : There thou wot shine indeed , and strike a reverenceInto the gazer .
You can flatter too .
No praise of thee can be thought so , thy virtueWill deserve all , I must confess , we CourtiersDo oftentimes commend to shew our Art , There is necessity sometimes to say , This Madam breaths Arabian Gumms , Amber and Cassia ; though while we are praising , We wish we had no nostrils to take inTh ' offensive steam of her corrupted Lungs.Nay , some will swear they love their Mistriss , Would hazard lives and fortunes , to preserveOne of her hairs brighter than Berinices ; Or young Apollo 's , and yet after this , A favour from another toy would tempt himTo laugh , while the officious hangman whipsHer head off .
Fine men .
I am none of these , Nay , there are women Polidora , tooThat can do pretty well at flatteries ; Make men believe they dote , will languish for 'em , Can kiss a Jewel out of one , and dallyA carcanet of Diamonds from another , Weep into th ' bosome , of a third , and makeHim drop as many Pearls ; they count it nothingTo talk a reasonable heir within ten daysOut of his whole Estate , and make him madHe has no more wealth to consume .
You 'll teach meTo think I may be flattered in your promises , Since you live where this Art is most profest .
I dare not be so wicked Polidora , The Infant errors of the Court I mayBe guilty of , but never to abuseSo rare a goodness , nor indeed did everConverse with any of those shames of Court , To practise for base ends ; be confidentMy heart is full of thine , and I so deeplyCarry the figure of my Polydora , It is not in the power of time or distanceTo cancel it , by all that 's blest I love thee : Love thee above all women , dare invokeA curse when I forsake thee .
Let it be someGentle one .
Teach me an oath I prethee , One strong enough to bind , if thou dost findAny suspition of my faith , or elseDirect me in some horrid imprecation : When I forsake thee for the love of otherWomen , may heaven reward my apostacyTo blast my greatest happiness on earth , And make all joys abortive .
Revoke these hasty syllables , they carryToo great a penalty for breach of LoveTo me , I am not worth thy suffering , You do not know , what beauty may inviteYour change , what happiness may tempt your eyeAnd heart together .
Should all the graces of your sex conspireIn one , and she should court [ me ] , with a Dowry , Able to buy a Kingdom , when I giveMy heart from Polidora .
I suspect not , And to requite thy constancy , I swear .
'Twere sin to let thee waste thy breathI have assurance of thy noble thoughts .
My Lord , your Uncle hath been every whereI ' th ' Court inquiring for you , his looks speakSome earnest cause .
I am more acquainted withThy virtue , than to imagine thou wilt notExcuse me now , one kiss dismisses himWhose heart shall wait on Polidora pretheeLet me not wish for thy return too often , My Father .
Nestorius , and a servant .
I met Arcadius in strange haste , he told meHe had been with thee .
Some affair too soonRavish 'd him hence , his Uncle sent for himYou came now from Court : how looks the QueenThis golden morning ?
Like a Bride , her soulIs all on mirth , her eyes have quick'ning fires , Able to strike a spring into the earth , In winter .
Then Lisimachus can haveNo frost in 's blood , that lives so near her beams .
His politick Father the Protector smiles too , Resolve to see the ceremony of the Queen'Twill be a day of state .
I am not well .
How ! not well ? retire then , I must returnMy attendance is expected , Polidora , Be careful of thy health .
It will concern me. [ Exit .
Arcadius , and Macarius .
You amaze me , Sir .
Dear Nephew , if thou respect thy safetyMy honor , or my age , remove thy self , Thy life 's in danger .
Mine ? who 's my enemy ?
Take horse , and instantly forsake the City , Or else within some unsuspected dwelling , Obscure thy self , stay not to know the reason .
Sir , I beseech your pardon , which i ' th ' numberOf my offences unto any , shouldProvoke this dishonourable flight ?
I would , when I petition 'd for thy stay , I had pleaded for thy banishment , thou knowst notWhat threatens thee .
I would desire to know it , I am in no conspiracy of treason , Have ravish 'd no mans Mistriss , not so muchAs given the lye to any , what should meanYour strange and violent fears , I will [ n ] ot stirUntil you make me sensible I have lostMy innocence .
I must not live to seeThy body full of wounds , it were less sinTo rip thy Fathers Marble , and fetch fromThe reverend vault , his ashes , and disperse themBy some rude winds , where none should ever findThe sacred dust : it was his Legacy , The breath he mingled with his prayers to HeavenI [ sh ] ould preserve Arcadius , whose fateHe prophesied in death , would need protection , Thou wot disturb his ghost , and call it toAffright my dreams , if thou refuse to obey me .
You more inflame me , to enquire the causeOf your distraction , and you 'll arm me betterThan any coward flight by acquainting meWhose malice aims to kill me , good Sir tell me .
Then prayers and tears assist me .

Ha , keep off .
What mean you , Sir ?

By whom ?
I know not , nor wou 'd I part with life so tamely .
We dare engage ours in your quarrel , hideYour sword , it may beget suspition , It 's enough to question you .
I am confident ; Pray pardon me , come , I despise all danger : Yet a dear friend of mine , my Uncle told meHe would not see my body full of wounds .
Your Uncle , this is strange .
Yes , my honest Uncle , If my unlucky Stars have pointed meSo dire a fate .
There is some strange mistake i n't .
Antigonus .
Arcadius , the Queen would speak with you , You must make haste .
Though to my death , I flieUpon her summons I give up my breathThen willingly , if she command it from me .
This does a little trouble me .
I know notWhat to imagine , something is the groundOf this perplexity , but I hope there is notAny such danger as he apprehends .
Queen , Lisimachus , Macarius , Eubulus , Seleucus , Arcadius , Ladies , Attendants and Gent .
We have already granted to SeleucusAnd they shall try their valour , if ArcadiusHave spirit in him to accept the challenge , Our Royal word is past .
This is strange .
Madam , my son knew not what he ask 'd , And you were cruel to consent so soon .
Wherein have I offended , to be rob'dAt once , of all the wealth I have , ArcadiusIs part of me .
Seleucus 's life and mineAre twisted on one thred , both stand or fallTogether , hath the service for my CountreyDeserved but this reward , to be sent weepingTo my eternal home ? Was't not enoughWhen I was young , to lose my bloud in wars , But the poor remnant that is scarcely warmAnd faintly creeping through my wither 'd veinsMust be let out to make you sport .
How canWe , that shall this morn see the sacred oyl , Fall on your Virgin tresses , hope for anyProtection hereafter , when this dayYou sacrifice the blood of them that pray for you .
, I prethee speak thy self , It is for thee I plead .
Seleucus , kneelAnd say thou hast repented thy rash suit ; If e'er I see thee fight , I be thus wounded , How will the least drop forc 'd from thy veins , Afflict my heart .
Why , that 's good ;
, speak to her ; hear him Madam .
If you call back this honor you have done meI shall repent I live , doe not perswade me:
, thou art a noble enemy , And I will love thy soul , though I despairOur bodies friendly conversation : I would we were to tugg upon some cliffe , Or like two prodigies i'th ' air , our conflictMight generally be gaz 'd at , and our bloudAppease our grandsires ashes .
I am undone .
Madam , my father says I have offended , If so , I beg your pardon , but beseech youFor your own glory , call not back your word .
They are both mad .
No more , we have resolv 'd , And since their courage is so nobly flam 'd , This morning we 'll behold the ChampionsWithin the List , be not afraid , their strifeWill stretch so far as death , so soon as weAre Crown 'd , prepare your selves , Seleucus. [ Kisses her hand .
I have receiv 'd another life in this high favour , And may lose what nature gave me .
Arcadius , to encourage thy young valour , We give thee our Fathers sword.Command it from our Armory ; Lisimachus , To our Coronation. [ Exeunt .
I 'll forfeitMy head for a rebellion , than suffer it. [ Exit .
I am circled with confusions , I 'll do somewhatMy brains and friends assist me. [ Exit .
But do you think they 'll fight indeed ?
PerhapsHer Majesty will see a bout or two.And yet 't is wondrous strange , such spectaclesAre rare i'th ' Court , and they were to skirmish nakedBefore her , then there might be some excuse.There is gimcracks i n't , the Queen is wiseAbove her years .
Macarius is perplex 'd .
Eubulus .
I can not blame him , but my Lord EubulusReturns , they are both troubled , 'las good men , But our duties are expected , we forget. [ Ex. Phil. Lis .
I must resolve , and yet things are not ripe , My brains upon the torture .
This may quitThe hazard of his person , whose least dropOf blood , is worth more than our families.My Lord Eubulus , I have thought a wayTo stay the young mens desperate proceedings , It is our cause they fight , let us beseechThe Queen , to grant us two the priviledgeOf Duel , rather than expose their livesTo eithers fury ; it were pity theyShould run upon so black a destiny , We are both old , and may be spar 'd , a pairOf fruitless trees , mossie , and wither 'd trunks , That fill up too much room .
Most willingly , And I will praise her charity to allow it ; I have not yet forg [ o ] t to use a sword , Let 's lose no time , by this act , she will licenceOur souls to leave our bodies but a day , Perhaps an hour the sooner ; they may liveTo do her better service , and be friendsWhen we are dead , and yet I have no hopeThis will be granted , curse upon our faction .
If she deny us --
What ?
I wou 'd do somewhat --
There 's something o ' th ' suddain struck uponMy imagination that may secure us .
Name it , if no dishonor wait upon'tTo preserve them , I 'll accept any danger .
There is no other way , and yet my heartWould be excus 'd , but 't is to save his life .
Speak it Eubulus .
In your ear I shall , It sha'not make a noise if you refuse it .
Hum ? though it stir my bloud , I 'll meet Arcadius , If this preserve thee not , I must unsealAnother mistery. [ Exit .
, Lisimachus , Cassander , Charilla , Lisander , Philocles , Antigonus .
We owe to all your loves , and will deserveAt least by our endeavours , that none mayThis day repent their prayers , my Lord Protector .
Madam , I have noSuch Title now , and am blest to loseThat name so happily : I was but trustedWith a glorious burden .
You have prov'dYour self our faithful Counsellor , and must stillProtect our growing state : a Kingdoms ScepterWeighs down a womans arm , this Crown sits heavyUpon my brow already , and we knowThere 's something more than mettal in this wreath , Of shining glory , but your faith , and counsel , That are familiar with mysteries , And depths of state , have power to make us fitFor such a bearing , in which both you shallDoe loyal service , and reward your Duties .
Heaven preserve your Highness .
But yet my Lords and Gentlemen , let noneMistake me , that because I urge your wisdoms , I shall grow careless , and impose on youThe managing of this great Province , no , We will be active too , and as we areIn dignity above your persons , so , The greatest portion of the difficultiesWe call to us , you in your several placesRelieving us with your experience , Observing in your best directionsAll modesty , and distance ; for althoughWe are but young , no action shall forfeitOur royal priviledge , or encourage anyToo unreverent boldness ; as it will becomeOur honor to consult , e'r we determineOf the most necessary things of state , So we are sensible of a check , But in a brow , that saucily controulsOur action , presuming on our yearsAs few , or frailty of our sex ; that headIs not secure , that dares our power or justice .
She has a brave spirit , look how the ProtectorGrows pale already .
But I speak to youAre perfect in obedience , and may spareThis Theme , yet 't was no immat [ eriall ] Part of our character , since I desireAll should take notice , I have studiedThe knowledge of my self , by which I shallBetter distinguish of your worth and personsIn your relations to us .
This languageIs but a threatening to some body .
But we miss some , that use not to absentTheir duties from us , where 's Macarius ?
Retir 'd to grieve , your Majesty hath givenConsent , Arcadius should enter the ListTo day with young Seleucus .
We purpose
They shall proceed , what 's he ?
A Gentleman belonging to Seleucus that gives noticeHe is prepar 'd , and waits your royal pleasure .
He was compos 'd for action , give noticeTo Arcadius , and admit the challenger : Let other Princes boast their gaudy tilting , And mockery of battles , but our triumphIs celebrated with true noble valour .
Seleucus , Arcadius , at several doors , their Pagesbefore them , bearing their Targets.Two young men spirited enough to haveTwo kingdoms staked upon their swords , LisimachusDo not they excellently become their arms ? 'Twere pity but they should do something moreThen wave their plumes. [ A shout within.What noise is that ?
Macarius , and Eubulus .
The peoples joy to know us reconcil 'd , Is added to the jubile of the day , We have no more a faction but one heart , Peace flow in every bosom .
Throw awayThese instruments of death , and like two friendsEmbrace by our example .
This unfein 'd ?
By our duties to your self , dear MadamCommand them not advance , our houses fromThis minute are incorporated ; happy dayOur eyes at which before revenge look 'd forth , May clear suspition , oh my Arcadius !
We have found a nearer way to friendship , Madam , Than by exposing them to fight for us .
If this be faithful , our desires are blest.We had no thought to waste , but reconcileYour bloud this way , and we did prophesieThis happy chance , spring into eithers bosom,
and Seleucus , what can nowBe added to this days felicity ? Yes , there is something , is there not my Lord ? While we are Virgin Queen .
Ha , that stringDoth promise Musick .
I am yet my LordsYour single joy , and when I look upon , What I have took , to manage the great careOf this most flourishing kingdom , I inclineTo think I shall do justice to my self , If I choose one , whose strength and virtue mayAssist my undertaking , think you Lords , A Husband would not help ?
No question , Madam , And he that [ you purpose to make ] so blestMust needs be worthy of our humblest duty , It is the general vote .
We will not thenTrouble Ambassadors to treat with anyPrinces abroad , within our own dominion , Fruitful in honor , we shall make our choice ; And that we may not keep you over longIn th [ e ] imagination , from this circle , weHave purpose to elect ; one , whom I shallSalute a King and Husband .
Now my Lord Lisimachus .
Nor shall we in this action be accus'dOf rashness , since the man we shall declareDeserving our affection , hath been earlyIn our opinion , which had reason firstTo guide it , and his known nobilityLong marry 'd to our thoughts , will justifieOur fair election .
Lisimachus blushes .
Direct our duties , Madam , to pray for him .
Arcadius , you see from whence we come , Pray lead us back , you may ascend. [ She comes from the State .
How 's this ? o're-reach 'd ?
Madam , be charitable to your humblest creature , Doe not reward the heart , that falls in dutyBeneath your feet , with making me the burdenOf the Court-mirth , a mockery for Pages , 'Twere Treason in me but to think you meane thus .
Arcadius , you must refuse my love , Or shame this Kingdom .
Is the wind in that corner ?
I shall run mad Lisimachus .
Sir , contain your self .
Is this to be believ 'd ?
What dream is this ?
He kisses her , now by this day I am glad o n't .
Mark the Protector .
Let him fret his heart-strings .
Is the day cloudy on the sudden ?
Gentlemen , It was not my ambition , I durst neverAspire so high in thought , but since her MajestyHath pleas 'd to call me to this honor , IWill study to be worthy of her grace , By whom I live .
The Church to morrow shallConfirme our marriage , noble Lisimachus ; We 'll find out other wayes to recompenceYour love to us , set forward , come Arcadius .
It must be so , and yet let me consider .
He insults already , policy assist me , To break his neck .
Who would trust Woman ? Lost in a pair of minutes , lost , how brightA morning rose , but now , [ and now ] 't is night ? [ Exeunt .
Polidora , and a Servant .
Oh where shall Virgins look for faith hereafter ? If he prove false , after so many vowes ? And yet if I consider , he was temptedAbove the strength of a young Lover , twoSuch glorious courting his acceptance , wereAble to make disloyalty no sin , At least not seem a fault , a Lady first , Whose very looks would thaw a man more frozenThan the Alps , quicken a soul more dead than Winter , Add to her beauty and perfection , That she 's a Queen , and brings with her a KingdomAble to make a great mind forfeit Heaven.What could the frailty of ArcadiusSuggest , to unspirit him so much , as notTo fly to her embraces , you were presentWhen she declar 'd her self .
Yes Madam .
Tell me , Did not he make a pause , when the fair QueenA full temptation stood him ?
Very littleMy judgment could distinguish , she did no soonerPropound , but he accepted .
That was ill , He might with honor stand one or two minutes , Me thinks it should have startled him a little , To have rememberd me , I have deserv'dAt least a cold thought , well , pray give it him .
I shall .
When ?
Instantly .
Not so , But take a time when his joy swels him most , When his delights are high and ravishing , When you perceive his Soul dance in his eyes , When she that must be his hath drest her beauty , With all her pride , and sends a thousand CupidsTo call him to the tasting of her lip ; Then give him this , and tell him , while I live , I 'll pray for him .
I shall. [ Exeunt .
Cassander , and Lisimachus .
There is no way but death .
That 's black , and horrid , Consider , Sir , it was her sin , not his ; I can not accuse him , what man could carryA heart so frozen , not to melt at suchA glorious flame ? Who could not fly to suchA happiness ?
Have you ambitionTo be a tame fool ? see so vast an injuryAnd not revenge it ? make me not suspectThy Mother for this sufferance , my Son .
Pray hear me , Sir .
Hear a patient gull , A property , thou hast no blood of mine , If this affront provoke thee not , how canstBe charitable to thy self , and let him liveTo glory in thy shame ? Nor is he innocent ; He had before crept slily into her bosome , And practised thy dishonor .
You begin to stir me , Sir .
How else could she be guiltyOf such contempt of thee ? and in the eyeOf all the Kingdom , they conspir 'd this stain , When they had cunning meetings , shall thy loveAnd blooming hopes be scatter 'd thus , and LisimachusStand idle gazer ?
What , Sir , will his deathAdvantage us , if she be false to me ? So irreligious , and to touch her person -- Pause , we may be observed .
Philocles , and Lisander .
'T is the ProtectorAnd his son .
Alas , poor Gentleman , I pittyHis neglect , but am not sorry for his Father. [ 'T is ] a strange turne .
The whirligigs of Women .
Your Graces servant .
I am yours Gentlemen , And should be happy to deserve your loves .
Now he can flatter .
I n't Sir , to inlarge your sufferings , I haveA heart doth wishThe Q [ u ] een had known better to rewardYour love and merit. [ Lisi. ] If you would expressYour love to me , pray do not mention it , I must obey my fate .
She will be marriedTo t'other Gentleman for certain then ?
I hope you 'll wish 'em joy .
Indeed I will , Sir .
Your Graces servant. [ Exit .
We are grownRidiculous , the pastime of the Court : Here comes another .
Seleucus .
Where 's your Son , my Lord ?
Like a neglected servant of his Mistress .
I would ask him a question .
What ?
Whether the Queen , As 't is reported , lov 'd him , he can tellWhether she promis 'd what they talke of , marriage .
I can resolve you that , Sir .
She did promise ?
Yes .
Then shee 's a Woman , and your Son ;
What ?
Not worthy his blood , and expectation , If he be calme .
There 's no opposing destiny .
I would cut the Throat .
Whose throat ?
The destinies , that 's all , your pardon , Sir , I am Seleucus still , a poor shadowOth ' World , a walking picture , it concernsNot me , I am forgotten by my stars .
The Queen , with more discretion , might ha chosen Thee .
Whom ?
Thee , Seleucus .
Me ? I can not dance , and frisk with due activity , My body is lead , I have too much phlegme , what shouldI do with a Kingdome ? no , ArcadiusBecomes the cushion , and can please , yet settingAside the trick that Ladies of Blood look at , Another Man might make a shift to weareRich Clothes , sit in the chair of state , and nod , Dare venture on discourse , that does not trenchOn compliment , and think the study of ArmesAnd Arts , more commendable in a Gentleman , Than any Galliard .
Arcadius , And you , were reconcil 'd .
We ? yes , oh yes , But 't is not manners now to say we are friends , At our equality there had been reason , But now subjection is the word .
They are notYet married .
I 'll make no Oath upo n't , My Lord Lisimachus , A word , you 'll not be angry if I love you , May not a Batchellor be made a Cuckold ?
How , Sir ?
Lisimachus , this GentlemanIs worth our embrace , hee 's spirited , And may be useful .
Hark you , can you tellWhere 's the best Dancing-master ? and you meanTo rise at Court , practise to caper , farewelThe noble science , that makes work for cutlers , It will be out of fashion to weare swords , Masques , and devices welcome , I salute you , Is it not pitty any divisionShould be heard out of Musick ? Oh 'twill beAn excellent age of crotchets ; and of Canters.Buy Captains , that like fools will spend your bloodOut of your Country , you will be of lessUse than your feathers , if you return unman'dYou shall be beaten soon to a new march , When you shall think it a discretionTo sell your glorious buffes to buy fine pumps , And pantables , this is I hope no treason .
Arcadius leading the Queen , Charia , Eubulus , Lisander , Philocles , Polidora , servant .
Wot stay Lisimachus ?
Yes , Sir , And shew a patience above her injury .
This honor is too much , Madam , assumeYour place , and let Arcadius waite still : 'T is happiness enough to be your servant .
Now he dissembles .
Sir , you must sit .
I am obedient .
This is not MusickSprightly enough , it feeds the soul with melancholy.How sayes Arcadius ?
Give me leave to thinkThere is no harmony but in your voice , And not an accent of your heavenly tongue , But strikes me into rapture , I inclineTo think , the tale of Orpheus no fable , 'T is possible he might inchant the Rocks , And charme the Forrest , soften hell , hell it self , With his commanding Lute , it is no miracleTo what you work , whose very breath conveyesThe hearer into Heaven , how at your lips , Day-winds gather Perfumes , proudly glide away , To disperse sweetness round about the world .
Fine stuff .
You can not flatter .
Not , if I should say , Nature had plac 'd you here the creatures wonder , And her own spring , from which all excellenceOn Earth 's deriv 'd , and copyed forth , and whenThe character of fair , and good in othersIs quite worne out , and lost , looking on youIt is supply 'd , and you alone made mortalTo feed , and keep alive all beauty .
Ha , ha , Can you indure it Gentlemen ?
What do you meane ?
Nay , ask him what he meanes , mine is a downRight laugh .
Well , Sir , proceed .
At such bright eyes the stars do light themselves , At such a forehead Swans renew their white , From such a lip the morning gathers blushes .
The morning is more modest than thy praises , What a thing does he make her ?
And when you flie to Heaven and leave this worldNo longer maintenance of goodness from you : Then Poetry shall lose all use with us , And be no more , since nothing in your absenceIs left , that can be worthy of a Verse .
Ha , ha .
Whose that ?
'T was I , Madam .
Seleucus ?
Ha ?
Yes , Sir , 't was I that laugh 'd .
At what ?
At nothing .
Contain your self , Seleucus .
Are you mad ?
Have you ambition to be punish 'd , Sir ?
I need not , 't was punishmentEnough to hear him make an Idol of you , he leftOut the commendation of your patience , I was a littleMov 'd in my nature , to hear his Rodomontados , andMake a monster of his Mistress , which I pitty 'd first , But seeing him proceed , I guest he brought youMirth with his inventions , and so made bold to laugh at it .
You are sawcy , We 'll place you where you sha'not be so merry , Take him away .
Submit your self .
Let me plead for his pardon .
I wo 'd not owe my life so poorly , beg thy own , When you are King you can not bribe your destiny .
Good Madam hear me , I fear he is distracted , Brave boy , thou should'st be Master of a soulLike his : thy honors more concern 'd .
'T is charity , A way wo ' mee , 'boy Madam ?
He has a daring spirit. [ Ex. Sel. Eub. Cas .

In my first state I had no enemies , I was secure , while I did grow beneathThis expectation , humble valleys thrive withTheir bosomes full of flowers , when the Hills meltWith lightning , and rough anger of the clouds , Let me retire .
And can ArcadiusAt such a breath be mov 'd , I had opinionYour courage durst have stood a tempest forOur love , can you for this incline to leaveWhat other Princes should in vain have sued for ? How many Lovers are in Epire nowWould throw themselves on danger , not expectOne enemy , but empty their own veins , And think the loss of all their blood rewarded , To have one smile of us when they are dying ? And shall this murmur shake you ?
Not dear Madam , My life is such a poor despised thing , In value your least graces , thatTo lose it were to make my self a victory , It is not for my self , I fear : the envyOf others can not fasten wound in meGreater , than that your goodness should be check'dSo daringly .
Let not those thoughts afflict thee , While we have power to correct the offences,
be mine , this shall confirm it .
I shall forget , And lose my way to heaven , that touch had beenEnough to have restor 'd me , and infus'dA spirit of a more celestial nature , After the tedious absence of my soul , Oh bless me not too much , one smile a dayWould stretch my life to mortality ; Poets that wrap divinity in tales , Look here , and give your coppies forth of angels , What blessing can remain ?
Our Marriage .
Place then some horrors in the wayFor me , not you , to pass , the journeys endHolds out such glories to me , I should thinkHell but a poor degree of suffering for it , What 's that , some petition ? a Letter to me .
Ith ' minu [ t ] e when my vessels new lanch 'd forth , With all my pride , and silken wings about meI strike upon a Rock : What power can save me ? You had a Polidora ; there 's a nameKill 'd with grief , I can so soon forget her .
She did impose on me this service , Sir , And while she lives she sayes , shee 'll pray for you .
She lives , That 's well , and yet 'twere better , for my fame , And honor , she were dead ; What fate hath plac 'd meUpon this fearful precipice ?
He 's troubled .
I must resolve , my faith is violatedAlready , yet poor loving PolidoraWill pray for me , she sayes , to think she canRender me hated to my self , and everyThought 's a tormentor , let me then be just .

By what means ?

Our good Unckle , welcome .
My Lord Macarius , we did want your person , There 's something in our joyes wherein you share .
This you intend your highness wedding day .
We are going .
Save you laborI have brought a Priest to meet you .
Reverend Father .
Meet us , Why ?
To tell you , that you must not Marry .
Didst thou hear that , Lisimachus ?
And wonder what will follow .
We must not marry .
Madam , 't is a ruleFirst made in heaven , and I must needs declareYou and Arcadius must tie no knotOf Man and Wife .
Is my Unckle mad ?
Joy has transported him , Or age has made him dote , MacariusProvoke us not too much , you will presumeAbove our mercy .

A jealousie he hadUpon Cassander , whose ambitious brainHe fear 'd would make no conscience to deposeHis son , to make Lisimachus King of Epire .
He made no scruple to expose me thenTo any danger ?
He secur 'd you , Madam , By an early Engagement of your affectionTo Lisimachus , exempt this testimony , Had he been Arcadius , and my Nephew , I needed not obtrude him on the state , Your love and marriage had made him KingWithout my trouble , and sav 'd that ambition , There was necessity to open nowHis birth , and title .

Where 's the Captain of the Castle ?
Hee 'll attend your honors presently .
Give him knowledge we expect him .
I shall , my Lord. [ Exit .
He is my creature , fear not , And shall run any course that we propound .
My Lord , I like the substance of your plot , 'T is promising , but matters of this consequenceAre not so easily perfect , and it doesConcern our heads to build upon securePrinciples , though Seleucus , I confess , Carry a high , and daring spirit in him , 'T is hard to thrust upon the state new setledAny impostor , and we know not yetWhether hee 'll undertake to play the Prince ; Or if he should accept it , with what cunningHe can behave himself .
My Lord , affairsOf such a glorious nature , are half finish 'd , When they begin with confidence .
AdmitHe want no art , [ n ] or courage , it must restUpon the people to receive his title , And with what danger their uncertain breathMay flatter ours , Demetrius scarcely warmIn the Kings seat , I may suspect .
That reasonMakes for our part , for if it be so probable , That young Demetrius should be living , WhyMay not we work them to believe , Leonatus , The eldest son was , by some trick , preserv 'd , And now would claim his own : there were two sons , Who in their Fathers life we supposed dead , May not we find a circumstance to makeThis seem as clear as t'other , let the vulgarBe once possest , wee 'll carry Epire from
, and the World .
I could be pleas'dTo see my Son a King .
Poleanus.The Captain 's here .
I waite your Lordships pleasure .
We come to visit your late prisoner : I will not doubt , but you intreat him fairly , He will deserve it for himself , and youBe fortunate in any occasion , To have exprest your service .
Sir , the knowledgeOf my honorable Lord his Father , willInstruct me to behave my self with allRespects becoming me , to such a son .
These things will leastOblige you , but how bears he his restraint ?
As one whose soul 's above it .
Patiently ?
With contempt rather of the great commandWhich made him prisoner , he will talke sometimesSo strangely to himself .
Hee 's here .
Seleucus .
Why was I born to be a subject ? 'tisSoon answer 'd , sure my Father was no Prince , That 's all : the same ingredients use to makeA Man , as active , though not royal bloodWent to my composition , and IWas gotten with as good a will perhaps , And my birth cost my Mother as much sorrow , As I had been born an Emperor .
While I lookUpon him , something in his face presentsA King indeed .
He does resemble much
too .
Whose son we would pretend him , This will advance our plot .
'T is but a name , And mere opinion , that prefers one manAbove another , I 'll imagine thenI am a Prince , or some brave thing on Earth , And see what follows : but it must not be , My single voice will carry it , the nameOf King must be attended with a troopOf acclamations , on whose ayrie wingsHe mounts , and once exalted , threatens Heaven , And all the stars : how to acquire this noise , And be the thing I talke of , men have rise [ n ] From a more cheap nobility to Empires , From dark originals , and sordid blood , Nay some that had no fathers , sons of the earth , And flying people , have aspir 'd to Kingdoms , Made nations tremble , and have practis 'd frownsTo awe the world , their memory is glorious , And I would hug them in their shades , but what'sAll this to me , that am I know not what , And less in expectation ?
Are you serious ?
Will you assist , and run a fate with us .
Command my life , I owe it to your favor .
Arcadius was once as far from beingAs I , and had we not so cunninglyBeen reconcil 'd , or one , or both had goneTo seek our fortunes in another world ; What 's the device now ? If my death be next , The summons shall not make me once look pale .
Chide your too vain suspitions , we bringA life , and liberty , with what else can makeThy ambition happy , th'ast a glorious flame , We come to advance it .
How ?
Have but a will , And be what thy own thoughts dare prompt thee to , A King .
You do not mock me Gentlemen ? You are my Father , Sir .
This minute shallDeclare it , my Seleucus , our hearts swell'dWith joy , with duty rather , oh my boy !
What 's the mistery ?
You must be a King .
Seleucus , stay , thou art too incredulous , Let not our faith , and study to exalt thee , Be so rewarded .
I pronounce thee King , Unless thy spirit be turn 'd coward , andThou faint to accept it .
King of what ?
Of Epire .
Although the Queen , since she sent me hither , Were gone to Heaven I know not how , That title could devolve to me .
We haveNo Queen , since he that should have married her , Is prov 'd her youngest brother , and now KingIn his own title .
Thank you Gentlemen , There 's hope for me .
Why , you dare fight with himAnd need be , for the Kingdom .
With Arcadius ? If you 'll make stakes , my life against his crown , I 'll fight with him , and you , and your fine Son , And all the Courtiers one after another .
'Two'not come to that .
I am of your Lordships mind , so fare you well .
Yet stay and hear --
What ? that you have betray 'd me : Do , tell your King , my life is grown a burden , And I 'll confess , and make your souls look pale , To see how nimble mine shall leap this battlementOf flesh , and dying , laugh at your poor malice .
No more , long live Leonatus King of Epire .
Leonatus , Who 's that ?
Be bold , and be a King , our brains have beenWorking to raise you to this height , here areNone but friends , dare you but call your self
, and but justifie with confidenceWhat we 'll proclaime you , if we do not bringThe Crown to your head , we [ w ] ill forfeit ours .
The state is in distraction , ArcadiusIs prov 'd a King , there was an elder brother , If you dare but pronounce , you are the same , Forget you are my son .
These are no trifles , Sir , all is plotted , To assure your greatness ; if you will be wise , And take the faire occasion that 's presented .
Arcadius , you say , is lawful King , And now to depose him , you would make meAn elder brother , is't not so ?
Most right .
Nay , right or wrong , if this be your true meaning .
Upon our lives .
I 'll venture mine , but with your pardon , Whose brain was this ? from whom took this plot life ?
My Lord Cassander .
And you are of his mind ? and you ? and thinkThis may be done ?
The destinies shall not cross us , if you haveSpirit to undertake it .
Undertake it ? I am not us 'd to compliment , I 'll oweMy life to you , my fortunes to your Lordship , Compose me as you please , and when y'ave madeMe what you promise , you shall both divideMe equally : one word , my Lord , I had ratherLive in the prison still , than be a propencyTo advance his politick ends .
Have no suspition .
So , so , I see Demetrius heels alreadyTrip 'd up , and I 'll dispatch him out oth ' way , Which gone , I can depose this at my leasure , Being an Impostor , then my Son stands fair , And may piece with the Princess , we lose time , What think you , if we first surprize the Court ? While you command the Castle , we shall curbeAll opposition .
Let 's proclaim him first , I have some faction , the people love me , They gain 'd to us , wee 'll fall upon the Court .
Unless Demetrius yield himself , he bleeds .
Who dares call treason sin , when it succeeds ? [ Exeunt Omnes .
Sophia , and Charilla .
Madam , you are too passionate , and loseThe greatness of your soul , with the expenceOf too much grief , for that which providenceHath eas 'd you of , the burden of a stateAbove your tender bearing .
Thour't a fool , And canst not reach the spirit of a Lady , Born great as I was , and made onely lessBy a too cruel destiny , aboveOur tender bearing : What goes richer toThe composition of Man , than ours ? Our soul as free , and spatious ; our heart'sAs great , our will as large , each thought as active , And in this onely Man more proud than we , That would have us less capable of Empire , But search the stories , and the name of QueenShines bright with glory , and some precedentsAbove Mans imitation .
I grant itFor the honor of our sex , nor have you , Madam , By any weakness , forfeited command , He that succeeds , in justice , was before you , And you have gain 'd more , in a royal brother , Than you could lose by your resign of Epire .
This I allow Charilla , I ha done ; 'T is not the thought I am depos 'd afflicts me , At the same time I feel a joy to knowMy Brother living : no , there is anotherWound in me above cure .
Virtue forbid .
Canst find me out a Surgeon for that ?
For what ?
My bleeding fame .
Oh do not injureYour own clear innocence .
Do not flatter me , I have been guilty of an act , will makeAll love in women question 'd , is not thatA blot upon a Virgins name ? my birthCannot extenuate my shame , I amBecome the stain of Epire .
'T is butYour own opinion , Madam , which presentsSomething to fright your self , which cannotBe in the same shape so horrid to our sense .
Thou wod'st , but canst not appear ignorant : Did not the Court , nay , the whole Kingdom , takeNotice , I lov 'd Lisimachus ?
True , Madam .
No , I was false , Though counsel 'd by my Father to affect him , I had my politick ends upon Cassander , To be absolute Queen , flattering his son with hopesOf love and marriage , when that very dayI blush to think I wrong 'd Lisimachus , That noble Gentleman , but heaven punish 'd me ; For though to know Demetrius was a blessing , Yet who will not impute it my dishonor .
Madam , you yet may recompence Lisimachus , If you affect him now , you were not falseTo him , whom then you lov 'd not , if you canFind any gentle passion in your soulTo entertain his thought , no doubt his heart , Though sad retains a noble will to meet it , His love was firm to you , and can not beUnrooted with one storme .
He will not sureTrust any language from her tongue that mock 'd him , Although my soul doth weep for't , and is punish'dTo love him above the world .
Lisimachus .
Hee 's hereAs fate would have him reconcil 'd , be free , And speak your thoughts .
If , Madam , I appearToo bold , your charity will sign my pardon : I heard you were not well , which made me hasteTo pay the duty of an humble visit .
You do not mock me , Sir .
I am confidentYou think me not so lost to manners , inThe knowledge of your person , to bring with meSuch rudeness , I have nothing to present , But a heart full of wishes for your health , And what else may be added to your happiness .
I thought you had been sensible .
How Madam ?
A man of understanding , can you spendOne prayer for me , remembring the dishonorI have done Lisimachus ?
Nothing can deface that part of myReligion in me , not to pray for you .
It is not then impossible you mayForgive me too , indeed I have a soulIs full of penitence , and something else , If blushing would allow to give't a name .
What Madam ?
Love , a love that should redeemMy past offence , and make me white again .
I hope no sadness can possess your thoughtsFor me , I am not worthy of this sorrow , But if you mean it any satisfactionFor what your will hath made me suffer , 'tisBut a strange overflow of Charity , To keep me still alive , be your self Madam , And let no cause of mine , be guilty ofThis rape upon your eyes , my name 's not worthThe least of all your tears .
You think 'em counterfeit .
Although I maySuspect a Womans smile hereafter , yetI would believe their wet eyes , and if thisBe what you promise , for my sake , I haveBut one reply .
I waite it .
I have nowAnother Mistress .
Stay .
To whom I have madeSince your revolt from me , a new chaste vow , Which not the second malice of my fateShall violate , and she deserves it , Madam , Even for that wherein you are excellent , Beauty , in which she shines equal to youHer vertue , if she but maintain what nowShe is Mistress of , beyond all competition , So rich it can not know to be improv 'd , At least in my esteem , I may offend , But truth shall justifie , I have not flatter 'd her , I beg your pardon , and to leave , my dutyUpon your hand , all that is good flow in you. [ Exit .
Did he not say , Charilla , that he hadAnother Mistress ?
Such a sound , methought , Came from him .
Let 's remove , here 's too much ayre , The sad note multiplies .
Take courage , Madam , And my advice , he has another Mistress , If he have twenty , be you wise , and cross himWith entertaining twice as many servants , And when he sees your humor he 'll return.And sue for any Livery , grieve for this .
It must be she , 't is Polidora hasTaken his heart , she live my rival , How does the thought inflame me !
And yet she does but justly , and he too ; I would have rob 'd her of Arcadius heart , And they will both have this revenge on me , But something will rebel. [ Exit .
Demetrius , Philocles , Lisander .
The house is desolate , none comes forth to meet us , Shee 's slow to entertain us : Philocles , I prethee tell me , did she weare no cloudUpon her brow , was't freely that she saidWe should be welcome .
To my apprehension , Yet 't is my wonder she appears not .
She , nor any other , Sure there 's some conceitTo excuse it .
Stay , Who 's this ? observe what follows ?
Fortune ? some maske to entertain you , Sir.Enter Fortune crown 'd , attended with Youth , Health , andPleasure .
Not yet ? What silence doth inhabit here ? No preparation to bid Fortune welcome ! Fortune , the genious of the World , have weDescended from our pride , and state to come , So far attended with our darlings , Youth , Pleasure , and Health , to be neglected thus ? Sure this is not the place ? call hither Fame .
Fame .
What would great Fortune ?
Know , Who dwells here .
Once more I report great Queen , This is the house of Love .
It can not be , This place has too much shade , and looks as ifIt had been quite forgotten of the Spring , And Sun-beames Love , affect society , And heat , here all is cold as the hairs of Winter , No harmony , to catch the busie eareOf passengers , no object of delight , To take the wandring eyes , no song , no groneOf Lovers , no complaint of Wil [ l ] ow garlands , Love has a Beacon upon his palace top , Of flaming hearts , to call the weary pilgrimeTo rest , and dwell with him , I see no fireTo threaten , or to warme : Can Love dwell here ?
If there be noble love upon the World , Trust Fame , and find it here .
Make good your boast , And bring him to us .
What does mean all this ?
I told you , Sir , we should have some device .
There 's Cupid now , that little Gentleman , Has troubled every Masque at Court this seven year .
No more .
Welcome to Love , how much you honor me ! It had become me , that , upon your summons , I should have waited upon mighty Fortune , But since you have vouchsafed to visit me ; All the delights Love can invent , shall flowTo entertain you , Musick through the ayreShoot your inticing harmony .
We came to dance and revel with you .
I am poorIn my ambition , and want thought to reachHow much you honor Love. [ Dance .
Honor .
What intrusion 's this ? Whom do you seek here .
'T is honor .
He my servant .
Fortune is come to visit us .
And hasCorrupted Love : Is this thy faith to her , On whom we both waite , to betray her thusTo Fortunes triumph ? take her giddy wheel , And be no more companion to honor ; I blush to know thee , Who 'll believe there canBe truth in Love hereafter ?
I have foundMy eyes , and see my shame , and with it , thisProud sorceress , from whom , and all her charmes , I flye agen to Honor , be my guard , Without thee I am lost , and can not boast , The merit of a name .
Despis 'd ? I shallRemember this affront .
What Moral 's this ? [ Exeunt .
Honor with the Crown upon a mourning Cushion.What melancholly object strikes a suddenChillness through all my veines ; and turns me Ice ? It is the same I sent , the very same , As the first pledge of her insuing greatness : Why in this mourning livery , if she liveTo whom I sent it ? ha , What shape of sorrow ?
Polidora in mourning.It is not Polidora , she was faireEnough , and wanted not the setting offWith such a black : if thou beest Polidora , Why mournes my love ? it neither does becomeThy fortune , nor my joyes .
But it becomesMy griefs , this habit fits a funeral , And it were sin , my Lord , not to lamentA friend new dead .
And I yet living ? canA sorrow enter but upon thy Garment , Or discomplexion thy attire , whilst IEnjoy a life for thee ? Who can deserve , Weigh 'd with thy living comforts , but a pieceOf all this Ceremony ? give him a name .
He was Arcadius .
Arcadius ?
A Gentleman that lov 'd me dearly once , And does compel these poor , and fruitless drops , Which willingly would fall upon his hearse , To imbalme him twice .
And are you sure hee 's dead ?
As sure as you'r living , Sir , and yetI did not close his eyes , but he is dead , And I shall never see the same Arcadius : He was a Man so rich in all that 's good , At least I thought him so , so perfect inThe rules of honor , whom alone to imitateWere glory in a Prince , Nature her self , Till his creation , wrought imperfectly , As she had made but tryal of the rest , To mould him excellent .
And is he dead ? Come , shame him not with praises , recollectThy scatter 'd hopes , and let me tell my best , And dearest Polidora , that he lives , Still lives to honor thee .
Lives , Where ?
Look here.Am not I worth your knowledge ?
And my duty , You are Demetrius , King of Epire , Sir.I could not easily mistake him so , To whom I gave my heart .
Mine is not chang 'd , But still hath fed upon thy memory , These honors , and additions of stateAre lent me for thy sake , be not so strange , Let me not lose my entertainment , nowI am improv 'd , and rais 'd unto the height , Beneath which , I did blush to ask thy love .
Give me your pardon , Sir , Arcadius , At our last meeting , without argument , To move him more than his affection to me , Vow 'd he did love me ; love me above all Women , And to confirm his heart , was truely mine , He wish 'd , I tremble to remember it , When he forsook his Polidora 's love , That Heaven might kill his happiness on Earth : Was not this nobly said ? did not this promiseA truth to shame the Turtles ?
And his heartIs still the same , and I thy constant Lover .
Give me your leave , I pray , I would not say,
was perjur 'd , but the same dayForgetting all his promises , and oathes , While yet they hung upon his lips , forsook me , D'ee not remember this too , gave his faithFrom me , transported with the noise of greatness , And would be married to a Kingdom .
But Heaven permitted not I should disposeWhat was ordain 'd for thee .
It was not virtueIn him , for sure he found no check , no stingIn his own bosome , but gave freely allThe reines to blind ambition .
I am wounded , The thought of thee ith ' throng of all my joyes , Like poyson powr 'd in Nectar , turnes me frantick : Dear , if Arcadius have made a fault , Let not Demetrius be punish 'd for't , He pleads that ever will be constant to thee .
Shall I believe Mans flatteries agen , Lose my sweet rest , and peace of thought agen , Be drawn by you , from the streight paths of virtue , Into the maze of Love .
I see compassion in thy eye , that chides me , If I have either soul , but what 's contain'dWithin these words , or if one syllableOf their full force , be not made good by me , May all relenting thoughts in you take end , And thy disdain be doubled , from thy pardon , I 'll count my Coronation ; and that hourFix with a rubrick in my Calendar , As an auspicious time , to entertainAffairs of weight with Princes ; think who nowIntreats thy mercy , come , thou sha't be kind , And divide Titles with me .
Hear me , Sir , I lov 'd you once for virtue , and have notA thought so much unguarded , as to be wonFrom my truth , and innocence with anyMotives of state to affect you , Your bright temptation mourns while it stayes here ; Nor can the triumph of glory , which made youForget me , so court my opinion back , Were you no King , I should be sooner drawnAgain to love you , but 't is now too late , A low obedience shall become me best : May all the joyes I wantStill wait on you , if time hereafter tell you , That sorrow for your fault hath struck me dead , May one soft tear drop from your eye , in pittyBedew my hearse , and I shall sleep securely : I have but one word more for goodness sake , For your own honor , Sir , correct your passion , To her you shall love next , and I forgive you. [ Exit .
Her heart is frozen up , nor can warm prayersThaw it to any softness .
I 'll fetch her , Sir , again .
Perswade her not .
You give your passion too much leave to triumph.Seek in another what she denies .
Macarius .
Where 's the King ? oh , Sir , you are undone , A dangerous treason is a foot .
What Treason ?
Cassander , and Eubulus have proclaim'dAnother King , whom they pretend to be
your elder Brother , he that was , But this morning prisoner in the Castle .
Ha ?
The easie EpirotesGather in multitudes to advance his Title , They have seised upon the Court , secure your person , Whilst we raise power to curbe this Insurrection .
Lose no time then .
We will not Arme one Man , Speak it agen , have I a brother living ? And must be no King .
What means your Grace ?
This newes doth speak me happy , it exaltsMy heart , and makes me capable of moreThan twenty Kingdoms .
Will you not , Sir , standUpon your guard ?
I 'll stand upon my honor , Mercy relieves me .
Will you lose the Kingdom ?
The World 's too poor to bribe me : leaveMe all , lest you extenuate my fame , and IBe thought to have redeem 'd it by your counsel , You shall not share one scruple in the honor ; Titles may set a gloss upon our Name , But Virtue onely is the soul of Fame .
He 's strangely possest Gentlemen. [ Exeunt Omnes .
Philocles , and Lisander .
Heres a strange turne , Lisander .
'T is a KingdomEasily purchas 'd , who will trust the faithOf multitudes ?
It was his fault , that wouldSo tamely give his Title to their Mercy , The new King has possession .
And is likeTo keep't , we are alone , what dost think ofThis innovation ? Is't not a fine Jigge ? A precious cunning in the late ProtectorTo shuffle a new Prince into the state .
I know not how they have shuffled , but my head o n't , A false card is turn 'd up trump , but fates look to't .
Cassander and Eubulus .
Does he not carry it bravely ?
Excellently .
, Lisander .
Your Lordships servants , Are we not bound to heaven , for multiplyingThese blessings on the Kingdom .
Heaven aloneWorks miracles , my Lord .
I think your LordshipHad as little hope once to see these PrincesRevive .
Here we must place our thanks , Next providence , for preservingSo dear a pledge .

It is our pleasureThe number of our guard be doubled , giveA Largess to the Soldiers ; but dismiss notThe Troops till we command .
May it please .
It will not please us otherwise , my Lord , We have try 'd your faith .
Does he not speak with confidence ?
My Lords and Gentlemen , to whose faith we mustOwe next to Heaven our fortune , and our safety , After a tedious eclipse , the dayIs bright , and we invested in those honors , Our bloud , and birth did challenge .
May no timeBe registred in our annals , that shall mentionOne that had life to oppose your sacred person .
Let them , whose Titles forg 'd and flaw 'd , suspectTheir states security , our right to Epire , Heaven is oblig 'd to prosper , treason hasNo face so black to fright it , all my caresLevel to this , that I may worthilyManage the province , and advance the honorOf our dear Countrey , and be confident , If an expence of bloud , may give additionOf any happiness to you , I shallOffer my heart the sacrifice , and rejoyceTo make my self a ghost , to have inscrib'dUpon my marble , but whose cause I died for .
May Heaven avert such danger .
Excellent Prince , In whom we see the Copy of his Father , None but the Son of Theodosius , Could have spoke thus .
[ You ] are pleas 'd to interpret well , Yet give me leave to say in my own justice , I have but exprest the promptness of my soulTo serve you all , but 't is not empty wishesCan satisfie our mighty charge , a weightWould make an Atlas double , a Kings nameDoth sound harmoniously to men at distance ; And those who can not penetrate beyondThe bark , and out-skin of a Common-wealth , Or state , have eyes , but ravish 'd with the CeremonyThat must attend a Prince , and understand notWhat cares allay the glories of a Crown , But good Kings find and feel the contrary , You have try 'd , my Lord , the burden , and can tellIt would require a Pilot of more yearsTo steer this Kingdom , now impos 'd on me , By justice of my birth .
I wish not life , But to partake those happy days , which mustSucceed these fair proceedings , we are blest , But Sir , be sparing to your self , we shallHazard our joyes in you too soon , the burdenOf state affairs , impose upon your counsel.'Tis fitter that we waste our lives than you , Call age too soon upon you with the trouble , And cares that threaten such an undertaking , Preserve your youth .
And choose you our Prote [ c ] tor , Is't that you would conclude my Lord ? We willDeserve our subjects faith for our own sake , Not sit an idle gazer at the helm .
How observ 'd you that , Mark how Cassander 's Planet struck .
He might have look 'd more calmly for all that , I begin to fear ; but do not yet seem troubled .
With what news travels his haste ? I must secureMy self betimes , not be a King in jest , And wear my Crown a Tenant to their breath .

I said not so my Lord .
I 'll have it thought so , hence. [ Exit Messen .

Let it work , Were Demetrius dead , we easily might uncrownThis swoln Impostor , and my Son be fairTo piece with young Sophia , who I hearRepents her late affront .
Their lives may doYou service , let not blood stain your beginningsThe people not yet warm in their allegeance , May think it worth their tumult to revenge itWith hazard of your self .
Who dares but think it ? Yet offer first our mercy , if they yield,
must not live , my Lord your counsel , What if he were in heaven ?
You have my consent , You sha'not stay long after him .
Sophia isNot my Sister , To prevent all that may indanger us , we 'll marry her ; That done , no matter though we stand discover 'd , For in her Title then we are King of Epire , Without dispute .

What 's your opinion ?
He countermines my plot : are you so cunning .
What 's that you mutter ; Sir ?
I mutter , Sir ?
Best say I am no King , but some impostorRais 'd up to gull the state .
Very fine to have said withinFew hours you 'd been no King , nor like to be , Was not in the compass of High TreasonI take it .

Me to prison ?

My head ?
Vouchsafe to hear me , great Sir .
How dares he be so insolent ? I ha ' wrought my self into a fine condition , Do'e know me Gentlemen ?
Very well my Lord ; How are we bound to heaven for multiplyingThese blessings on the Kingdom .
We allow it .
Counsel did never blast a Princes ear .

Away with him : when KingsFrown , let offenders tremble , this flows notFrom any cruelty in my nature , butThe fate of an Usurper : he that willBe confirm 'd great without just title to't , Must lose compassion , know what 's good , not do't. [ Exeunt .
Polidora and her servant .
Madam , the Princess Sophia .
I attend her Highness .
Sophia.How much your grace honors your humble servant .
I hope my brother 's well .
I hope so too , Madam .
Do you but hope ? he came to be your guest .
We are all his , whilst he is pleas 'd to honorThis poor roof with his royal presence , Madam .
I came to ask your pardon Polidora .
You never , Madam , trespass 'd upon me , Wrong not your goodness .
I can be but penitent , Unless you point me out some other wayTo satisfie .
Dear Madam , do not mock me .
There [ is ] no injury like that to love , I find it now in my own sufferings : But though I would have rob 'd thee of ArcadiusHeaven knew a way to reconcile your hearts , And punish [ d ] me in those joys you have found : I read the story of my loss of honor , Yet can rejoyce , and heartily , that youHave met your own agen .
Whom do you mean ?
My brother .
He is found to himself and honor , He is my King , and though I must acknowledgeHe was the glory of my thoughts , and ILov 'd him , as you did , Madam , with desireTo be made his , reason , and duty since , Form 'd me to other knowledge , and I nowLook on him without any wish of moreThan to be call 'd his subject .
Has he madeHimself less capable by being King ?
Of what ?
Of your affection .
With your pardon , Madam.Love in that sense you mean , left PolidoraWhen he forsook Arcadius , I disclaimAll ties between us , more than what a nameOf King must challenge from my obedience .
This does confirm my jealousie , my heart , For my sake , Madam , has he lost his value ?
Let me beseech your grace , I may have leaveTo answer in some other cause , or person : This argument but opens a sad woundTo make it bleed afresh ; we may change this
Praises may more delight your ear than thisCan mine ; let 's talk of young Lisimachus .
Ha ? my presaging fears .
How does your grace ?
Well , you were talking of Lisimachus , Pray give me your opinion of him .
Mine ? It will be much short of his worth : I think himA gentleman so perfect in all goodness , That if there be one in the world deservesThe best of women , heaven created him , To make her happy .
You have , in a little , Madam , Exprest a volume of mankind , a miracle ; But all have not the same degree of faith , He is but young .
What Mistriss would desireHer servant old ? he has both Spring to pleaseHer eye and Summer to return a harvest .
He is black .
He sets a beauty off more rich , And she that 's fair will love him ; faint complexionsBetray effeminate minds , and love of change : Two beauties in a bed , compound few men ; He 's not so fair to counterfeit a woman , Nor yet so black , but blushes may betrayHis modesty .
His proportion exceeds not .
That praises him , and a well compacted frameSpeaks temper , and sweet flow of elements : Vast buildings are more oft for shew than use : I would not have my eyes put to the travelOf many acres , e'r I could examineA man from head to foot ; he has no great , But he may boast , an elegant composition .
I 'll hear no more , you have so far out-doneMy injuries to you , that I call backMy penitence , and must tell Polidora , This revenge ill becomes her. Am I thoughtSo lost in soul to hear , and forgive this ? In what shade do I live ? or shall I thinkI have not , at the lowest , enough merit , Setting aside my birth , to poize with yours : Forgive my modest thoughts , if I rise upIn my own defence , and tell this unjust LadySo great a winter hath not frozen yetMy cheek , but there [ is ] something nature planted , That carries as much bloom , and spring upo n't , As yours. What flame is in your eye , but mayFind competition here ? ( forgive agenMy Virgin honor , ) what is in your lipTo tice the enamour 'd soul , to dwell with moreAmbition , than the yet unwither 'd blushThat speaks the innocence of mine ?
Demetrius.Oh brother ?
I 'll talk with you anon , my Polidora , Allow thy patience till my breath recover , Which now comes laden with the richest newsThy ear was ever blest with .
Both your looks , And voice express some welcome accident .
Guess what in wish could make me fortunateAnd heaven hath dropt that on Demetrius .
What means this extasie ?
'Twere sin to busieThy thoughts upo n't , I 'll tell thee that I couldRetein some part ; 't is too wide a joyTo be exprest so soon , and yet it fallsIn a few syllables , thou wot scarce believe me , I am no King .
How 's that !
Good Heaven forbid .
Forbid ? Heaven has reliev 'd me with a mercyI knew not how to ask , I have , they say , An elder brother living , crown 'd already , I only keep my name Demetrius , Without desire of more addition , Than to return thy servant .
You amaze me , Can you rejoyce to be deposed:
It butTranslates me to a fairer and better KingdomIn Polidora .
Me ?
Did you not say , Were I no King , you could be drawn to loveMe agen , that was consented to in Heaven : A Kingdom first betraid my ambitious soulTo forget thee , that , and the flattering glories , How willingly Demetrius does resign , The Angels know : thus naked without TitlesI throw me on thy charity , and shallBoast greater Empire to be thine agen , thanTo wear the triumphs of the world upon me .

Brave young man , Did you not hear him Brother ?
I am not minded .

Son. [ E [ xit ] Anti .
It is not then our brother ?
An insolent usurper , proud , and bloudy ;
, is no leprosie upon me ? There is not punishment enough in natureTo quit my horrid act , I have not inMy stock of blood , to satisfie with weeping , Nor could my soul , though melted to a floodWithin me , gush out tears to wash my stain off .
How ? an Impostor , what will become on 's now ? We are at his mercy .
Sir , the peoples heartsWill come to their own dwelling , when they seeI dare accuse my self , and suffer for it , Have courage then young King , thy fate cannotBe long compell 'd .
Rise , our misfortuneCarries this good , although it lose our hopes , It makes you friend with virtue , we 'll expectWhat providence will do .
You are too merciful .
Our duties shall beg heaven still to preserve you .
Antigonus .
Our enemy desires some parley , Sir .
'T is not amiss to hear their proposition .
I 'll wait upon you .
Thou art my Angel , and canst best instruct me , Boldly present our selves , you 'll with Cassander .
And in death be blestTo find our charity. [ Exit .
Lisimachus .
Madam .
They will not miss your presence , the small timeIs spent in asking of a question .
I wait your pleasure .
Sir , I have a suit to you .
To me ? it must be granted .
If you haveCancell 'd your kind opinion of me , Deny me not to know , who hath succeeded
in your heart , I beg the nameOf your new Mistriss .
You shall know her , Madam , If but these tumults cease , and fate allow usTo see the Court agen , I hope you 'll bringNo mutiny against her , but this isNo time to talk of Love , let me attend you .
I must expect , till you are pleas 'd to satisfieMy poor request , conduct me at your pleasure. [ Exeunt .
Leonatus , Eubulus , Bishop , Lisander , and Philocles .
They are too slow , dispatch new messengers , To intreat 'em fairly hither , I am extasi 'd , Were you witness for me too ? is it possibleI am what this affirms , true Leonatus , And were you not my Father , was I givenIn trust to you an Infant ?
'T is a truth , Our soul 's bound to acknowledge , you supply'dThe absence and opinion of my Son.Who died , but to make you my greater careI know not of Demetrius , but suppos'dHim dead indeed , as Epire thought you were , Your Fathers character doth want no testimony , Which but compar 'd with what concerns DemetriusWill prove it self King Theodosius act , Your Royal Father .
I am subscrib 'd to both his LegaciesBy oath oblig 'd to secresie , untilThus fairly summon 'd to reveal the trust .
Cassander had no thought you would prove thus , To whose policie I gave this aim , althoughHe wrought you up to serve but as his EngineTo batter young Demetrius , for it wasYour Fathers prudent jealousie , that made himGive out your early deaths , as if his soulProphecy 'd his own first , and fear 'd to leaveEither of you , to the unsafe protection , Of one , whose study would be to supplantYour right , and make himself the King of Epire .
Your Sister , fair Sophia , in your FathersLife , was design 'd to marry with LisimachusThat guarded her ; although she us 'd some ArtTo quit her pupillage , and being absolute , Declar 'd love to Demetrius , which enforc 'd
to discover first your brother .
No more , lest you destroy agen LeonatusWith wonder of his fate , are they not come yet ? Something it was , I felt within my envyOf young Demetrius 's fortune , there were seedsScattered upon my heart , that made it swellWith thought of Empire , Princes I see cannotBe totally eclips 'd , but wherefore stays
and Sophia , at whose namesA gentle spirit walk 'd upon my blood .
Demetrius , Polidora , Sophia , Macarius , Cassander,
They are here .
Then thus I flie into their bosoms , Nature has rectifi 'd in me , Demetrius , The wandrings of ambition , our dear SisterYou are amaz 'd , I did expect it , readAssurance there , the day is big with wonder .
What means all this ?
Lisimachus , be dear to us,
, you are welcome too .
Not I , I do not look for't , all this sha'not bribeMy conscience to your faction , and makeMe false agen , Seleucus is no sonOf Theodosius , my dear Countrey-menCorrect your erring duties , and to that , Your lawful King , prostrate your selves , DemetriusDoth challenge all your knees .
All Love and Duty , Flow from me to my Royal King , and BrotherI am confirm 'd .
You are t [ o ] o credulous , What can betray your faith so much ?
Sophia , you appear sad , as if your WillGave no consent to this days happiness .
No joy exceeds Sophia 's for your self .
With your pardon , Sir , I apprehendA cause that makes her troubled , she desiresTo know , what other Mistriss , since her lateUnkindness I have chosen to directMy faith and service .
Another Mistriss ?
Yes , Sir .
And does our Sister love Lisimachus ?
Here 's something would confess .
He must not dareTo affront Sophia .
How my shame confounds me , I beg your justice , without pity onMy age .
Your pennance shall be , to be faithfulTo our state hereafter,
May you live long and happy,
, King of Epire .
But where 's your other Mistriss ?
Even here , Sir .
Our Sister ? is this another Mistriss , Sir ?
It holdsTo prove my thoughts were so when she beganHer sorrow for neglecting me , that sweetnessDeserv 'd , I should esteem her another Mistriss , Then when she cruelly forsook Lisimachus , Your pardon Madam , and receive a heartProud with my first devotions to serve you .
In this I am crown 'd agen , now mine for ever .
You have deceiv 'd her happily , Joy to you both .
We are ripe for the same wishes,
part of me .
He all my blessing .
Heaven pour full joys upon you .
We are all blest , There wants but one to fill your arms .

PROLOGUE.This Comedy long forgot , by some thought dead , By us preserv 'd , once more doth raise her head.And to your noble censures does present , Her outward form , and inward ornament.Nor let this smell of arrogance , since 't is known , The makers that confest it for their ownWere this way skilful , and without the crimeOf flatteries I may say did please the time ; The work it self too , when it first came forth , In the opinion of men of worth , Was well receiv 'd and favour 'd , though some rudeAnd harsh among th ' ignorant multitude , ( That relish gross food , better than a dish , That 's cook 'd with care , and serv 'd into the wish , Of curious pallats ) wanting wit and strength , Truly to judge , condemn 'd it for the length , That fault 's reform 'd , and now 't is to be try'dBefore such Judges 'twill not be deny'dA free and noble hearing : nor fear I , But 'twill deserve to have free liberty , And give you cause ( and with content ) to say , Their care was good , that did revive this Play .
Richardo and Viola .
Let us make use of this stolen privacy , And not loose time in protestation , Mistriss , For 'twere in me a kind of breach of faith , To say again I love you .
Sweet , speak softlyFor though the venture of your love to me , Meets with a willing , and a full return : Should it arrive unto my Fathers knowledge ; This were our last discourse .
How shall he know it ?
His watching cares are such , for my advancement , That every where his eye is fix 'd upon me : This night that does afford us some small freedom , At the request and much intreaty ofThe Mistriss of the House , was hardly given me : For I am never suffer 'd to stir out , But he hath spies upon me : yet I know notYou have so won upon me , that could I thinkYou would love faithfully ( though to entertainAnother thought of you , would be my death ) I should adventure on his utmost anger .
Why do you think I can be false ?
No faith , You [ h ] ave an honest face , but if you should --
Let all the stor 'd vengeance of heaven 's justice --
No more , I do believe you , the dance ended , Which this free womans ghests have vow 'd to haveE'r they depart , I will make home , and store meWith all the Jewels , Chains , and Gold are trustedUnto my custody , and at the next corner , To my Fathers house , before one at the farthest , Be ready to receive me .
I desireNo bond beyond your promise , let 's go in , To talk thus much , before the door , may breedSuspition .
Mercury and Antonio talking .
Here are company too .
Away , Those powers that prosper true and honest lovesWill bless our undertakings .
'T is my wish , Sir. [ Exit Rich. and Vio .
Nay , Sir , excuse me , I have drawn you toToo much expence already in my travel : And you have been too forward in your love ; To make my wants your own , allow me mannersWhich you must grant I want , should I increase , The bond in which your courtesies have ti 'd me : By still consuming you , give me leaveTo take mine own ways now , and I shall often , With willingness , come to visit you , and then thank you .
By this hand I could be angry , what do you think me ? Must we that have so long time been as oneSeen Cities , Countreys , Kingdoms , and their wonders ; Been bedfellows , and in our various journeyMixt all our observations , part ( as ifWe were two Carriers at two several ways , And as the fore-horse guides , cry God be with you ) Without or compliment , or ceremony ? In Travellers , that know transalpine garbs , Though our designs are nee'r so serious , friend , It were a capital crime , it must not be : Nay , what is more , you shall not ; you e'r long , Shall see my house , and find what I call mineIs wholly at your service .
'T is this tires me , Sir , I were easily woo 'd , if nothing elseBut my Will lay in the choice : but 't is not so , My friends and kindred that have part of me , And such on whom my chiefest hopes depend , Justly expect the tender of my loveAfter my travel : then mine own honestyTells me 't is poor , having indifferent meansTo keep me in my quality and rank , At my return , to tire anothers bounty , And let mine own grow lusty , pardon me .
I will not , can not , to conclude , I dare not : Can any thing conferr 'd upon my friendBe burthensome to me ? for this excuseHad I no reason else , you should not leave me , By a travellers faith you should not , I have said , And then you know my humor , there 's no contending .
Is there no way to 'scape this Inundation ? I shall be drown 'd with folly if I go : And after nine days , men may take me up , With my gall broken .
Are you yet resolv 'd ?
Wou 'd you would spare me .
By this light I cannotBy all that may be sworn by .
Patience help me , And heaven grant his folly be not catching : If it be , the Town 's undone , I now would giveA reasonable sum of gold to any Sheriff , That would but lay an execution on me , And free me from his company ; while he was abroad , His want of wit and language kept him dumb ? But Balaam 's Asse will speak now , without spurring .
Speak , have I won you ? --
You are not to be resisted .
Be ready I intreat you , the dance done , Besides a liberal reward I have , A bottle of Sherry in my power shall begetNew crotchets in your heads .
Tush , fear not us , we 'll do our parts .
Go in .
I know this fellow.Belong you to the house ?
I serve the Mistriss .
Pretty , and short , pray you Sir then inform her , Two Gentlemen are covetous to be honor 'd , With her fair presence .
She shall know so much , This is a merry night with us , and forbid notWelcome to any that looks like a man : I 'll guide you the way .
Nay , follow , I have a trick in't. [ Exit .
Uberto , Silvio , Richardo , Maria , Pedro , Portia , Viola,
Come , where 's this Masque ? fairest , for our chear , Our thanks and service , may you long survive , To joy in many of these nights .
I thank you .
We must have Musick too , or else you give us , But half a welcome .
Pray you Sir , excuse me .
By no means , Lady .
We 'll crown our liberal feast , With some delightful strain fitting your love : And this good company .
Since you enforce it , I will not plead the excuse of want of skillOr be , or nice , or curious , every yearI celebrate my marriage night ; and willTill I see my absent Husband .
'T is fit freedom .
Richardo thou art dull --
I shall be lighter , When I have had a heat .
Now Sir , the news ?
Mistriss , there are two Gentlemen .
Where ?
Complimenting who should first enter .
What are they ?
Heaven knows , but for their strangeness , have you never seena Cat wash her face ?
Yes .
Just such a stir they keep , if you make but haste , You may see 'em yet before they enter .
Antonia and Mercurie .
Let 'em be what they [ will , ] we 'll [ give ] them fairEntertain , and gentle welcome .
It shall be so .
Then let it be your pleasure .
Lets stand aside , and you shall see us haveFine sport anon .
A fair society , do you know these Gentlewomen ?
Yes .
What are they ?
The second is a neighbors Daughter , her name is Viola.There is my kinsmans wife , Portia her name , and aFriend too .
Let her -- what 's she that leads the dance ?
A Gentlewoman .
I see that .
Indeed ?
What ?
A Gentlewoman .
Udsfoot , good Sir , what 's she that leads the dance ?
My Mistriss .
What else ?
My Mistriss , Sir .
Your Mistriss ? a pox on you , What a fry of fools are here ? I see 't is treason to understand inthis house : if nature were not better to them , than they can be tothemselves , they would scant hit their mouths ; my Mistriss ? is thereany one with so much wit in 's head , that can tell me at the firstfight , what Gentlewoman that is that leads the dance ? [ Ant. ] 'T is my wife .
Hum .
How dost thou like her ?
Well , a pretty Gentlewoman .
Prethee be quiet .
I would I couldLet never any hereafter that 's a man , That has affections in him , and free passions , Receive the least tye from such a fool as this is , That holds so sweet a wife , 't is lamentable to consider trulyWhat right he robs himself of , and what wrongHe doth the youth of such a Gentlewoman , That knows her beauty , is no longer hers , Than men will please to make it so , and use itNeither of which lies freely in a Husband , Oh what have I done , what have I done , Coxcomb ? If I had never seen , or never tastedThe goodness of this kix , I had been a made man , But now to make a Cuckold is a sinAgainst all forgiveness , worse than a murther ; I have a Wolf by the ears , and am bitten both ways .
How now friend , what are you thinking of ?
Nothing concerning you , I must be gone .
Pardon me , I 'll have no going , Sir .
Then good Sir , give me leave to go to bed , I am very weary , and ill-temper 'd .
You shall presently , the dance is done .
Mistriss , these are the Gentlemen .
My Husband 's welcome home , dear Sir .
She 's fair still , oh that I were a knave , or durst be one , For thy sake coxcomb ; he that invented honesty , undid me .
I thought you had not known me , y'are merry 't is well ; thought , And how ist with these worthy Gentlemen ?
We are glad to see you here again .
Oh Gent , what ha ' you lost ? but get you into travels , There you may learn , I can not say what hidden virtues .
Hidden from you I am sure , My blood boils like a furnace , She 's a fare one .
Pray entertain this Gent. with all the courtesie , Fitting my most especial friend .
What this poor house may yield , To make you welcome , dear Sir , commandWithout more compliment .
I thank you : She 's wise , and speaks well too , oh what a blessingIs gone by me , ne'er to be recovered ! Well , 't was an old shame the Devil laid up for me , and now has hit mehome ; if there be any ways to be dishonest , and save myself yet , -- -- No , it must not be , why should I be a fool too -- -- Yet those eyes wouldtempt another Adam , how they call to me , and tell me -- -- S'foot , theyshall not tell me any thing , Sir , will you walk in ?
How is't , Signior ?
Crazie a little .
What ail you , Sir ? What 's in my power , pray make use of , Sir .
'T is that must do me good , she does not mock me sure ? And't please you nothing , my disease is only weariness .
Come Gentlemen , we 'll not keep you from your beds too long .
I ha ' some business , and 't is late , and you far from yourlodging .
Well. [ Exit manent , Ant. Mar. and Mer .

Richardo , Uberto , Pedro , and Silvio .
Well you must have this wench then .
I hope so , I am much o'th ' bow-hand else .
Wou 'd I were hang 'd , 't is a good loving little fool , that daresventure her self upon a coast she never knew yet , but these women , when they are once thirteen , god speed the plough .
Faith they 'll venture further for their lading , than aMerchant , and through as many storms , but they 'll be fraughted , theyare mad [ e ] like Carrecks , only strength and storage .
Come , come , you talk , you talk .
We do so , but tell me Richardo , wot thou marry her ?
Marry her ? why , what should I do with her ?
Pox , I thought we should have [ had ] all shares in her , likelawful prize .
No by my faith , Sir , you shall pardon me , I lanch 'd her at myown charge , without partners and so I 'll keep her .
What 's the hour ?
Twelve .
What shall we do the while ? 't is yet scarce eleven .
There 's no standing here , is not this the place ?
Yes .
And to go back unto her fathers house , may breed suspition , Let 's slip into a Tavern , for an hour , 't is very cold .
Content , there is one hard by , a quart of burnt sack willrecover us , I am as cold as Christmas , this stealing flesh in thefrosty weather , may be sweet i'th ' eating , but sure the Woodmen haveno great catch o n't ; Shall 's go ?
Thou art the strangest lover of a Tavern , What shall we dothere now ? lose the hour and our selves too .
Lose a pudding ; What do'st thou talk of the hour ; Will one quartmuzle us ? have we not ears to hear , and tongues to ask the Drawers , but we must stand here like bawds to watch the minutes ?
Prethee content thy self , we shall scout here , as though wewent a haying , and have some mangey prentice , that can not sleep forscratching , over-hear us ; Come , Will you go Sirs ? when your love furyis a little frozen , you 'll come to us .
Will you drink but one quart then ?

That I have business ? no I warrant ye .
Good Sir take your rest .
Pray my good friend let me appoint my own rest .
Yes , Sir .
Then shew me the way out , I 'll consider you .
Good Lord , Sir .
If I had not an excellent temper 'd patience , now should I breakthis fellows head , and make him understand 'twere necessary ; the onelyplague of this house is the unhandsome love of servants , that ne'er dotheir duty in the right place , but when they muster before dinner , andsweep the Table with a wodden dagger , and then they are troublesometoo , to all mens shoulders , the Woodcocks flesht agen , now I shallhave a new stir .
Antonio .
Why how now friend ? What do you up so late ? are you well ? Doyou want any thing ? pray speak .
Onely the cause I rise for .
What knaves are these ? What do you want ? why Sirrah ?
Nothing i'th ' World , but the keyes to let me out of dores ; Imust be gon , be not against it , for you can not stay me .
Be gon at this time ? that were a merry jest .
If there be any mirth i n't , make you use o n't , but I must go .
Why for loves sake ?
'Twill benefit your understanding nothing to know the cause , pray go to bed , I 'll trouble your Man only .
Nay , Sir , you have rais 'd more , that has reason to curse you , and you knew all , my Wifes up , and coming down too .
Alas , it will be a trouble , pray go up to her , and let medisturbe no more , 't is unmannerly .
Wife as out of her [ b ] ed .
Shee 's here already ; sweet heart : How say you by thisGentleman ? he would away at midnight .
That I am sure he will not .
Indeed I must .
Good Sir let not your homely entertainment press you to leaveyour bed at midnight ; if you want , what my house or our town mayafford you , make it your own fault if you call not for it ; pray go tobed again ; let me compel you , I am sure you have no power to deny aWoman ; the ayr is piercing , and to a body beaten with long travel , 'twill prove an ill Physitian .
If she speak longer I shall be a knave , as rank as ever sweatfor't ; Sir , if you will send your Wife up presently , I will eitherstay with you , d 'ye mark me , or deliver you , so just a cause , that youyour self , shall thrust me out of dores , both suddenly , and willingly .
I would fain hear that 'faith , pray thee go up sweet heart , Ihave half perswaded him , besides , he hath some private business withme .
Good night , Sir , and what content you would have , I wish withyou. [ Exit .
Could any man that had a back ask more ! O me ! O me !
Now deal directly with me : Why should you go ?
If you be wise do not enquire the cause , 'twill trouble you:
Why ? prithee why ?
'Faith I would not have you know it , let me go , 'twill be farbetter for you .
Who 's that , that knocks there ? i'st not at the street door ?
Yes , Sir .
Who 's there , can not you speak ?
A poor distressed Maid , for gods sake let me in .
Let her in and me out together , 't is but one labor , 't is pityshe should stand i'th ' street , it seems she knows you .
There she shall stand for me , you are ignorant ; this is acommon custome of the Rogues that lie about the loose parts of theCity .
As how ?
To knock at doors in dead time of night , and use some feignedvoice to raise compassion , and when the doors are open , in they rush , and cut the throats of all , and take the booty , we can not be toocareful .
As ever you had pity let me in , I am undone else .
Who are you ?
My name is Viola , a Gentlewoman , that ill chance hathdistressed , you know my Father .
Alas of god we 'll let her in , 't is one of the Gentlewomen werehere i'th ' evening , I know her by her name , ( poor soul ) shee 's cold Iwarrant her , let her have my warme Bed , and I 'll take her fortune ; come , pray come .
It is not Viola , that 's certain , she went home to herFathers , I am sure .
Will not you be so good to let me in ?
I 'll be so good to have you whipt away if you stay a little
will hear it , and not repent the knowing .
Since you are so importunate , I 'll tell you , I love your Wifeextreamly .
Very well .
And so well that I dare not stay .
Why ?
For wronging you , I know I am flesh and blood , and you havedone me friendships infinite and often , that must require me honest , and a true Man , and I will be so , or I 'll break my heart .
Why , you may stay for all this , methinks .
No , though I wood be good , I am no saint , nor is it safe to tryme , I deal plainly .
Come , I dare try you , do the best you can .
You shall not , when I am right agen , I 'll come and see you , till when , I 'll use all Countryes , and all means , but I will lose thisfolly , 't is a Divel .
Is there no way to stay you ?
No , unless you will have me such a villain to you , as all menshall spit at me .
Do 's she know you love her ?
No , I hope not , that were recompence fit for a Rogue to renderher .
If ever any had a faithful friend , I am that Man , and I mayglory i n't , this is he , that ipse , he that passes all Christendomefor goodness , he shall not over goe me in his friendship , 'twererecreant and base , and I 'll be hang 'd first , I am resolv 'd , go thywayes , a Wife [ shall ] never part us : I have consider 'd , and I find hernothing to such a friend as thou art ; I 'll speak a bold world , takeyour time and woe her , you have overcome me clearly , and do what'sfitting with her , you conceive me , I am glad at heart you love her : bythis light , ne 're stare upon me , for I will not flye from it , if youhad spoken sooner , sure you had been serv 'd ; Sir , you are not everyMan , now to your taske , I give you free leave , and the sin is mine ifthere be any in it .
He will be hang 'd before he makes this good , he can not be soinnocent a Coxcombe , he can tell ten sure , if I had never known you asI have done , I might be one , as others perhaps sooner , but now 'tisimpossible , there 's too much good between us .
Well , thou art e'en the best man -- I can say no more , I am , soover-joy 'd , you must stay this night , and in the morning go as earlyas you please , I have a toy for you .
I thought this pill would make you sick .
But where you mean to be I must have notice , And it must be hard by too , do you mark me ?
Why , What 's the matter ?
There is a thing in hand .
Why ? What thing ?
A sound one , if it take right , and you be not peevish. We twowill be -- you would little think it ; as famous for our friendship --
How ?
If [ God ] please , as ever Damon was , and Pytheas ; or
and Orestes , or any two that ever were : do you conceive meyet ?
No , by my troth , Sir ; he will not help me up sure .
You shall anon , and for our names , I think they shall liveafter us , and be remember 'd while there is a story ; or [ I ] lose myaime .
What a vengeance ailes he ? How do you ?
Yes faith , we two will be such friends , as the world shall ringof .
And why is all this ?
You shall enjoy my wife .
Away , away .
The wonder must begin , so I have cast it , 'twill be scurvyelse , you shall not stir a foot i n't , pray be quiet till I have madeit perfect .
What shall a Man do with this wretched fellow ? there is nomercy to be used towards him , he is not capable of any pitty , he willin spight of course be a Cuckold , And who can help it ? must it beginso needs Sir ? -- think agen .
Yes marry must it , and I my self will woe this woman for you , Do you perceive it now ? ha ?
Yes , now I have a little sight ith ' matter ; O that thy headshould be so monstrous , that all thy Servants hats may hang upo n't ! but do you meane to do this ?
Yes certain , I will woe her , and for you , strive not againstit , 't is the overthrow of the best plot that ever was then .
Nay , I 'll assure you , Sir , I 'll do no harm , you have too muchabout you of your own .
Have you thought of a place yet ?
A place ?
I a place where you will bide , prethee no more of this modesty , 't is foolish , and we were not determin 'd to be absolute friendsindeed , 'twere tolerable .
I have thought , and you shall hear from me .
Why , this will gain me everlasting glory ; I have the better ofhim , that 's my comfort , good night. [ Exit .
Good night , well go thy wayes , thou art the tydiest wittallthis day I think above ground , and yet thy end for all this must bemottly. [ Exit .
Tinker with a Cord , and Dorothy .
'T is b [ i ] tter cold ; a plague upon these Rogues , how wary theyare grown ! not a door open now , but double barr 'd ; not a Window , butup with a case of wood like a spice box , and their locks unpickable , the very Smiths that were half venture [ r ] s , drink penitent , singleAle , this is the Iron age , the Ballad sings of ; well , I shall meetwith some of our loose Linnen yet , good fellows must not starve ; here 's he shall shew God a mighties dog bolts , if this hold .
Faith thou art but too merciful , that 's thy fault , thou artas sweet a Thief , that sin excepted , as ever suffer 'd , that 's a proudword , and I 'll maintain it .
Come , prethee let 's shogg off , and browze an hour or two , there 's Ale will make a Cat speak , at the harrow , we shall get nothingnow , without we batter , 't is grown too near morning , the Rogues sleepsober , and are watchful .
We want a Boy extreamly for this function , kept under for ayear , with milk , and knot-grass ; in my time I have seen a boy dowonders ; Robbin the red Tinker had a Boy , Rest his Soul , he suffer'dthis time 4 years , for two Spoons , and a Pewter Candlestick , thatsweet Man had a Boy , as I am Curstend Whore , would have run through aCat hole , he would have boulted such a piece of Linen in an evening --
Well , we will have a Boy , prethee lets go , I am vengeancecold I tell thee .
I 'll be hang 'd before I stir without some purchase , bythese ten bones , I 'll turn she-ape , and untile a house , but I 'll haveit , it may be I have a humor to be hang 'd , I can not tell .
Viola .
Peace , you flead Whore , thou hast a mouth like a Bloodhound , here comes a night-shade .
A Gentlewoman Whore , by this darkness I 'll case her to theskin .
Peace , I say .
What fear have I endur 'd this dismal night ! And what disgrace , if I were seen and known ! In which this darkness onely is my friend , That onely has undone me ; a thousand cursesLight on my easie , foolish , childish love , That durst so lightly lay a confidenceUpon a Man , so many being false ; My weariness , and weeping , makes me sleepy , I must lie down .
What 's this ? a Prayer , or a Homily , or a Ballad of goodcouncel ? she has a Gown , I am sure .
Knock out her brains , and then shee 'll nee'r bite .
Yes , I will knock her , but not yet , you ? woman ?
For Gods sake what are you ?
One of the groomes of your wardrobe , come , uncase , uncase ; byr Lady a good Kersey .
Pray do not hurt me , Sir .
Let 's have no pitty , for if you do , here 's that shall cut yourwhistle .
Alas , what would you have ? I am as miserable as you can makeme any way .
That shall be try 'd .
Here , take my Gown , if that will do you pleasure .
Yes marry will it , look in the Pockets Doll , there may bebirds .
They are flown , a pox go with them , I 'll have this Hat , andthis Ruffe too , I like it , now will I flourish like a Lady , brave , I faith boy .
Y'are so gentle people to my seeming , That by my truth I could live with you .
Could you so ? a pretty young round wench , well bloudded , I amfor her , Theeves .
But by this I am not , coole your Codpiece , Rogue , or I 'll clapa spell upo n't , shall take your edge off with a very vengeance .
Peace , horse-flesh , peace , I 'll cast off my Amazon , she haswalk 'd too long , and is indeed notorious , shee 'll fight and scould , and drink like one of the worthies .
Uds , pretious you young contagious Whore , must you be ticing ? and , Is your flesh so wranck , Sir , that two may live upo n't ? I am gladto hear your Cortalls grown so lusty ; he was dry founder 'd t'otherday , wehee my pamper 'd Jade of Asia .
Good Woman do not hurt me , I am sorry that I have given anycause of anger .
Either bind her quickly , and come away , or by this steel I 'll [ tell ] , though I truss for company ; now could I eate her broyl 'd , orany way , without Vinegar , I must have her Nose .
By any thing you love best , good Sir , good Woman .
Why her Nose , Dorothy ?
If I have it not , and presently [ and ] warm , I lose that I gowithal .

Will you bind her ? we shall stand here prating , and be hang'dboth .
Come , I must bind you , not a word , no crying .
Do what you will , indeed I will not cry .
Hurt her not , if thou dost , by Ale and Beer , I 'll clout thy oldbald brain pan , with a piece of Brass , you Bitch incarnate. [ Exeunt Tinker and Dorothy .
O [ God ] , to what am I reserv 'd , that knew notThrough all my childish hours and actions , More sin , than poor imagination , And too much loving of a faithless Man ? For which I 'm paid , and so , that not the dayThat now is rising to protect the harmless , And give the innocent a sanctuaryFrom theeves and spoilers , can deliver meFrom shame , at least suspition --
Valerio .
Sirrah , lead down the horses easily , I 'll walke a foot till Ibe down the hill , 't is very early , I shall reach home betimes. Hownow , whose there ?
Night , that was ever friend to Lovers , yetHas rais 'd some weary Soul , that hates his bed , To come and see me blush , and then laugh at me .
H'ad a rude heart that did this .
Gentle Sir , If you have that which honest men call pitty , And be as far from evil as you shew ; Help a poor Maid , that this night by bad fortuneHas been thus us 'd by Robbers .
A pox upon his heart that would not help thee , this Thief washalf a Lawyer by his bands , How long have you been tyed here ?
Alas , this hour , and with cold and fear am almost perisht .
Where were the watch the while ? good sober Gent. they were likecareful members of the City , drawing in diligent Ale , and singingcatches , while Mr. Constable contriv 'd the Tosts : these fellows wouldbe more severely punisht than wandring Gipsies , that every statutewhips ; for if they had every one two eyes a piece more , three potswould put them out .
I can not tell , I found no Christian to give me succor .
When they take a Thief , I 'll take Ostend agen ; the whorsonsdrink Opium in their Ale , and then they sleep like tops ; as for theirbills , they only serve to reach down Bacon to make Rashers on ; now letme know whom I have done this courtesie too , that I may thank my earlyrising for it .
Sir , All I am , you see .
You have a name I 'm sure , and a kindred , a Father , friend , orsomething that must own you ; shee 's a handsome young Wench ; WhatRogues were these to Rob her ?
Sir , you see all I dare reveale , And as you are a Gentleman press me no further ; For there begins a grief , whose bitternessWill break a stronger heart than I have in me , And 'twill but make you heavy with the hearing , For your own goodness sake desire it not .
If you would not have me enquire that , How do you live then ?
How I have liv 'd , is still one question , Which must not be resolv 'd -- How I desire to live , is in your liking , So worthy an opinion I have of you .
Is in my liking ? How I pray thee ? tell me , i'faith I 'll do youany good lies in my power ; she has an eye would raise a bedrid man ; come , leave your fear , and tell me , that 's a good Wench .
Sir , I would serve --
Who would'st thou serve ? do not weep and tell me .
Faith , Sir , even some good woman , and such a wife if you bemarried , I do imagine yours .
Alas ! thou art young and tender , let me see thy hand , this wasne'er made to wash , or wind up water , beat cloaths , or rub a floor , bythis light , for one use that shall be nameless , 't is the best wantonhand that e 're I lookt on .
Dare you accept me , Sir , my heart is honest , Among your vertuous charitable deeds , This will not be the least .
Thou canst in a Chamber ?
In a Chamber , Sir ?
I mean wait there upon a Gentlewoman , How quick she is , I like that mainly too ; I 'll have her , though I keep her with main strength like a besiegedTown , for I know I shall have the Enemy afore me within a week .
Sir , I can sow too , and make pretty laces , Dress a head handsome , teach young Gentlewomen , For in all these I have a little knowledge .
'T is well , no doubt I shall encrease that knowledge ; I like herbetter still , how she provokes me ; pritty young Maid , you shall servea good Gentlewoman , though I say't , that will not be unwilling youshould please me , nor I forgetful if you do .
I am the happier .
My man shall make some shift to carry you behind him , Can youride well ?
But I 'll hold fast for catching of a fall .
That 's the next way to pull another on you , I 'll work her as Igo , I know shee 's wax , now , now , at this time could I beget a Worthyon this Wench .
Sir , for this Gentleness , may Heaven requite you tenfold .
'T is a good Wench , however others use thee , be sure I 'll be aloving Master to thee , come. [ Exeunt .
Antonio like an Irish Footman , with a Letter .
I hope I am wild enough , for being known , I have writ a Letterhere , and in it have abus 'd my self most bitterly , yet all my fear isnot enough , for that must do it , that must lay it on , I 'll win her outi'th ' flint , 'twill be more famous , now for my language .
Servingman .
Now , Sir , Who would you speak with ?
Where be thy Mastres Man ? I would speak with her , I have a Letter .
Can not I deliver it ?
No , by my trot , and fait , can'st thou not Man .
Well , Sir , I 'll call her to you , pray shake your ears without alittle. [ Exit Servingman .

What 's he wood speak with me ?
A kill kenny ring , there he stands Madam .
What would you have with me , friend ?
He has a Letter for other Women , Wilt thou read it .
From whence ?
De Crosse creest from my Master .
Who is your Master ?
I pray do you look .
Do you know this fellow ?
No Maddam , not I ; more than an Irish Footman , stand furtherfriend , I do not like your roperunners , What stallion Rogues arethese , to weare such dowsetts , the very Cotton may commit adultery .
I can not find whose hand this should be , I 'll read , To thebeauteous wife of Don Antonio , sure this is some blind scribe -- wellnow , What follows ?
Pray God it take , I have given her that , will stir herconscience , how it works with her ; hope , if it be thy will , let theflesh have it .
This is the most abhor 'd , intollerable knavery , that ever slaveentertain 'd , sure there is more than thine own head in this villany , it goes like practic 'd mischiefe ; disabled in his body ? O good God , asI live he lies fearfully , and basely , ha ? I should know that Jewel , 't is my husband , come hither shat , Are you an Irish Man ?
Sweete Woman a Cree I am an Irish man .
Now I know it perfectly ; is this your trick , Sir ? I 'll trickyou for it ; How long have you serv 'd this Gentleman .
Please thee a little day , O my Mac dermond put me to myMastree , 't is don I know .
By my faith he speaks as well as if he had been lousy for thelanguage a year or two ; well , Sir , you had been better have kept yourown shape as I will use you , What have I done that should deserve thistryal ? I never made him Cuckold , to my knowledge , Sirrah come hither .
Now will she send some Jewel , or some Letter , I know her mindas well ; I shall be famous .
Take this Irish bawde here .
How ?
And kick him till his breeches and breech be of one colour , abright blew both .
I may be well swing 'd thus , for I dare not reveale my self , Ihope she does not mean it , O hone , O hone , O St. Patricke , O a Cree , O sweet Woman .
No , turn him , and kick him o't'other side , that 's well .
O good waiting Man , I beseech thee good waiting man , a pox fyreyour Legs .
You Rogue , you enemy to all , but little breeches , How dar'st thou come to me with such a Letter ?
Prethee pitty the poor Irishman , all this makes for me , if Iwin her yet , I am still more glorious .
Now could I weep at what I have done , but I 'll harden my heartagen , go shut him up , 'till my husband comes home , yet thus much ereye go , sirrah thach 'd head , Would'st not thou be whipt , and think itJustice ? well Aquavitæ Barrel , I will bounce you .
I pray do , I beseech you be not angry .
O you hobby headed Rascal , I 'll have you flead , and trossersmade of thy skin to tumble in , go a way with him , let him see no sun , till my husband come home , Sir , I shall meet with you for yourknavery , I fear it not .
Wilt thou not let me go ? I do not like this .
Away with him .
Come , I 'll lead you in by your Jack a lent hair , goquietly , or I 'll make your crupper crack .
And do you hear me , Sirrah ? and when you have done , make myCoach ready .
Yes forsooth. [ Exit Servingman with Antonio .
Lock him up safe enough , I 'll to this Gentleman , I know thereason of all this business , for I do suspect it , If he have thisplot , I 'll ring him such a peal , shall make his eares deaf for a monthat least. [ Exit .
Richardo .
Am I not mad ? Can this weak temper 'd head , That will be mad with drink , endure the wrongThat I have done a Virgin , and my Love ? Be mad , for so thou ought'st , or I will beateThe walls and trees , down with thee , and will letEither thy memory out , or madness in ; But sure I never lov 'd fair Viola , I never lov 'd my Father , nor my Mother , Or any thing but drink ; had I had love ; Nay , had I known so much charity , As would have sav 'd an Infant from the fire , I had been naked , raving in the street ; With halfe a face , gashing my self with knives , Two houres ere this time .
Pedro , Silvio , Uberto .
Good morrow Sir .
Good morrow Gentlemen , shall we go drink agen ? I have my wits .
So have I , but they are unsetled ones , would I had someporrige .
The Tavern boy was here this morning with meAnd told me , that there was a Gentlewoman , Which he took for a Whore , that hung on me : For whom we quarrel 'd , and I know not what .
I faith nor I .
I have a glimmering of some such thing .
Was it you , Silvio , That made me drink so much ? 't was you or Pedro .
I know not who .
We [ were ] all apt enough .
But I will lay the fault on none but me , That I would be so entreated , come Silvio , Shall we go drink agen , come Gentlemen , Why do you stay , let 's never leave off now , Whil'st we have Wine , and Throats , I 'll practise it , Till I have made it my best quality ; For what is best for me to do but that ? For [ Gods ] sake come and drink ; when I am nam 'd , Men shall make answer , Which Richardo mean you ? The excellent drinker ? I will have it so , Will you go drink ?
We drunk too much too lately .
Why there is then the less behind to drink , Let 's end it all , dispatch that , wee'l send abroad , And purchase all the Wine the world can yield , And then drink it off , then take the fruits o'th ' earth , Distil the Juice from them , and drink that off ; Wee'l catch the rain before it fall to ground , And drink off that that never more may grow ; Wee'l set our mouths to Springs , and drink them off , And all this while wee'l never think of thoseThat love us best , more than we did last night.We will not give unto the poor a dropOf all this drink , but when we see them weep , Wee'l run to them , and drink their tears off too , Wee'l never leave whilst there is heat or moisture , In this large globe , but suck it cold and dry , Till we have made it Elemental earth , Merely by drinking .
Is't flattery to tell you , you are mad ?
If it be false , There 's no such way to bind me to a Man ; He that will have me , lay my goods and lands , My life down for him , need no more , but say,
thou art mad , and then all theseAre at his service , then he pleases me , And makes me think that I had vertue in me , That I had love , and tenderness of heart , That though I have committed such a fault , As never creature did , yet running mad , As honest men should do for such a crime , I have exprest some worth , though it be late : But I alas have none of these in me , But keep my wits still like a frozen Man , That had no fire within him .
Nay , good Richardo leave this wild talk , and send a letter toher , I 'll deliver it .
'T is to no purpose ; perhaps she 's lost last night , Or she got home agen , she 's now so strictlyLook 'd to , the wind can scarce come to her , or admitShe were her self ; if she would hear from me , From me unworthy , that have us 'd her thus , She were so foolish , that she were no moreTo be belov 'd .
Andrugio and Servant with a Night-gown .
Sir , we have found this night-gown she took with her. [ An. Where ? ]
Where ? where ? speak quickly .
Searching in the Suburbs , we found a Tinker and his Whore thathad it in a Tap-house , whom we apprehended , and they confest theystole it from her .
And murthered her ?
What aile you man ?
Why all this doth not make me mad .
It does , you would not offer this else , good Pedro look tohis sword .
They do deny the killing of her , but swore they left her tyedto a Tree , in the fields , next those Suburbs that are without ourLadies gate , near day , and by the Rode , so that some passinger mustneeds unty her quickly .
The will of Heaven be done ! Sir , I will only entreat you this , that as you were the greatest occasion of her loss , that you will bepleased to urge your friends , and be your self earnest in the searchof her ; if she be found , she is yours , if she please , I my self only , see these people better examin 'd , and after follow some way in search , God keep you Gentlemen. [ Exit .
Alas good man !
What think you now of me , I think this lumpIs nothing but a piece of fleagme congeal'dWithout a soul , for where there 's so much spiritAs would but warm a flea , those faults of mineWould make it glow , and flame in this dull heart , And run like molten gold through every sin , Till it could burst these walls , and fly away.Shall I intreat you all to take your horses , And search this innocent ?
With all our hearts .
Do not divide your selves till you come there , Where they say she was ty 'd , I 'll follow too , But never to return till she be found.Give me my sword good Pedro , I will doNo harm , believe me , with it , I am nowFarr better temper 'd ; if I were not so , I have enow besides , God keep you all , And send us good success. [ Exeunt .
Mercury , and Servant .
Who is it ? can you tell ?
By my troth , Sir , I know not , but 't is a Gentlewoman .
A Gentleman , I 'll lay my life , you puppy , h'as sent his Wife to
Here she is , Sir .
Wife with a Letter .
I am glad I found you Sir , there , take your Letter , and keepit till you have another friend to wrong , 't is too malicious false tomake me sin , you have provoked me to be that I love not , a talker , and you shall hear me.Why should you dare to imagine meSo light a huswife , that from four hours knowledgeYou might presume to offer to my creditThis rude and ruffian tryal , I am sureI never courted you , nor gave you tokens , That might concern assurance , you are a fool .
I can not blame you now , I see this letter , Though you be angry , yet with me you must not , Unless you'l make me guilty of a wrong , My worst affections hate -- --
Did not you send it ?
No , upon my faith , which is more , I understand it not ; the handis as far from my knowledge , as the malice .
This is strange .
It is so , and had been stranger , and indeed more hateful , Had I , that have receiv 'd such courtesies , and owe so manyThanks , done this base office .
Your name is at it .
Yes , but not my nature , and I shall hate my name worse than themanner , for this base broking ; you are wise and vertuous , remove thisfault from me ; for on the love I bear to truth and goodness , thisLetter dare not name me for the author .
Now I perceive my husbands knavery , if [ my ] man can but findwhere he has been , I will goe with this Gentleman whatsoever comeso n't : and as I mean to carry it , both he and all the World shall thinkit fit , and thank me for it .
I must confess I loved you , at first , however this made meleave your house unmannerly , that might provoke me to do somethingill , both to your honor and my faith , and not to write this Letter , which I hold so truly wicked , that I will not think o n't .
I do believe you , and since I see you are free , my words werenot meant to you , but this is not the half of my affliction .
'T is pitty you should know more vexation ; may I enquire ?
Faith , Sir , I fear I have lost my husband .
Your husband ? it can not be : I pitty her , how she 's vext !
Servant .
How now ? What news ? nay speak , for we must know .
Faith I have found at length , by chance , where he has been .
Where ?
In a blind out-house in the Suburbs , pray God all be well withhim .
Why ?
There are his cloaths , but , What 's become of him , I can not yet enquire .
I am glad of this ; sure they have murther 'd him , What shall I do ?
Be not so grieved , before you know the truth , you have timeenough to weep , this is the sodain'st mischief ; Did you not bring anOfficer to search there , where you say you found his cloaths .
Yes , and we searcht it , and charg 'd the fellow with him : buthe , like a Rogue , stubborn Rogue , made answer , he knew not where hewas ; he had been there , but where he was now , he could not tell : Itell you true , I fear him .
Are all my hopes and longings to enjoy him , After this 3 yearstravel , come to this ?
It is the rankest house in all the City , the most cursed roguyBawdy-house. Hell fire it .
This is the worst I heard yet ; Will you go home ? I 'll bear youcompany , and give you the best help I may : this being here will wrongyou .
As you are a Gentleman , and as you lov 'd your dead friend , let me not go home , that will but heap one sorrow on another .
Why propose any thing and I 'll perform't ; I am at my wits endtoo .
So am I , O my dear Master !
Peace you great fool .
Then good Sir carry me to some retir 'd place , far from thesight of this unhappy City , whether you will indeed , so it be farenough .
If I might Councel you , I think 'twere better to go home , And try what may be done yet , he may be at home afore you , Whocan tell ?
O no , I know he 's dead , I know he 's murder 'd ; tell me not ofgoing home , you murder me too .
Well , since it pleases you to have it so , I will no moreperswade you to go home , I 'll be your guide in the Countrey , as yourgrief doth command me , I have a Mother dwelling from this place some20 miles : the house though homely , yet able to shew something like awelcome ; thither I 'll see you safe with all your sorrows .
With all the speed that may be thought upon ; I have a Coachhere ready , good Sir quickly ; I 'll fit you my fine husband .
It shall be so ; if this fellow be dead , I see no band of anyother Man , to tye me from my will , and I will follow her with suchcareful service , that she shall either be my Love , or Wife ; Will youwalk in ?
I thank you , Sir , but one word with my Man , and I am ready ; keep the Irish fellow safe , as you love your life , for he I fear hasa deep hand in this , then search agen , and get out warrants for thatnaughty man , that keeps the bad house , that he may answer it , if youfind the body , give it due burial ; farewel. You shall hear from me , keep all safe. [ Exeunt .

Good sweet fact serving-man , let me out I beseech de , and by mytrot I will give dye Worship 2 shillings in good argott , to buy dyWorship pippines .

I thank you , Sir , so I may have picking work .
Here is five shillings Man .
Here is a cudgel , a very good one .
How now , What 's the matter ? Where 's the Irishman .
There , a wyth take him , he makes more noise alone there , than ten Lawyers can do with double , and a scurvy Case .
Let him out , I must talk with him .
Antonio .
Wilt thou give me some drink , O hone ? I am very dry Man .
You shall have that shall quench your thirst , my friend .
Fate dost thou mean man .
Even a good tough halter .
A halter ? O hone !
Sirrah , you are a mischievous Rogue , that 's the truth .
No , fet I am not .
Shall I knock out his brains ? I have kill 'd dogs have beenworth three of him for all uses .
Sirrah , the truth o n't is , you must with me to a Justice.O Roger , Roger .
Why , what 's the matter William ?
Heavy news Roger , heavy newes ; god comfort us .
What is't Man ?
What 's the matter now ? I am e'en weary of this way , would Iwere out o n't .
My Master sure is murder 'd , Roger , and this cursed rogueI fear , has had a hand i n't .
No fet not .
Stand away , I 'll kickt out of him : come , sirrha , mount , I'llmake you dance , you Rascal , kill my Master ? If thy breech were cannonproof , having this good cause on my side , I would encounter it ; holdfair , Shamrocke .
Why how now Sirs ? you will not murder me indeed .
Bless us Roger !
Nay , I am no spirit .
How do you Sir , this is my very Master .
Why well enough yet , but you have a heavy foot of your own ; Where 's my Wife .
Alas poor sorrowful Gentlewoman , she thinks you are dead , andhas given o 're house-keeping .
Whether is she gone then ?
Into the Countrey with the Gentleman your Friend Sir , to seeif she can wear her sorrows out there ; she weeps and takes on tootoo --
This falls out pat ; I shall be everlasting for a name : Doe youhear ? upon your lives and faiths to me , not one word I am living , butlet the same report pass along , that I am murther 'd still ; I am madefor ever .
Why Sir ?
I have a Cause Sir , that 's enough for you ; well , if I be notfamous , I am wrong 'd much ; for any thing I know I will not troublehim this week at least , no , let them take their way one of another .
Sir , Will you be still an Irish-man ?
Yes a while .
But your Worship will be beaten no more ?
No , I thank you William .
In truth , Sir , if it must be so , I 'll do it better than astranger .
Goe , you are Knaves both , but I forgive you , I am almost madwith the apprehension of what I shall be , not a word I charge you. [ Exeunt .
Valerio , and Viola .
Come , pretty soul , we now are near our home , And whilst our horses are walkt down the hill , Let thou and I walke here over this Close : The foot-way is more pleasant , 't is a timeMy pretty one , not to be wept away , For every living thing is full of love ; Art not thou so too ? ha ?
Nay , there are living things empty of love , Or I had not been here , but for my self , Alas , I have too much .
It can not be , that so much beauty , so much youth and graceshould have too much of love .
Pray what is love ? for I am full of that I do not know .
Why , love fair Maid is an extream desire , That 's not to be examin 'd , but fulfill 'd , To ask the reason why thou art in love , Or what might be the noblest end in love , Would overthrow that kindly rising warmth , That many times slides gently o'r the heart , 'Twould make thee grave and staid , thy thoughts would be , Like a thrice married Widow , full of ends , And void of all compassion , and to fright theeFrom such enquiry , whereas thou art nowLiving in ignorance , mild , fresh , and sweet , And but sixteen ; the knowing what love is , Would make thee six and forty .
Would it would make me nothing , I have heardScholars affirm , the world 's upheld by Love , But I believe , women maintain all this , For there 's no love in men .
Yes , in some men .
I know them not .
Why , there is love in me .
There 's charity I am sure towards me .
And love ; which I will now express , my pretty maid , I dare not bring thee home , my wife is foul , And therefore envious , she is very old , And therefore jealous : thou art fair and young.A subject fit for her unlucky vicesNo work upon , she never will endure thee .
She may endureIf she be ought , but Devil , all the friendshipThat I will hold with you ; can she endureI should be thankful to you ? may I prayFor you and her , will she be brought to think.That all the honest industry I have , Deserves brown bread ? if this may be endur'dShe 'll pick a quarrel with a sleeping child , E'r she fall out with me .
But trust me , she does hate all handsomness .
How fell you in love with such a creature ?
I never lov 'd her .
And yet married her ?
She was a rich one .
And you swore I warrant you , she was a fair one then too .
Or believe me , I think I had not had her .
Are you men all such ? wou 'd you wou 'd wall us in a placeWhere all we women that are innocent , Might live together .
Do not weep at this , Although I dare not for some weighty reasonDisplease my Wife , yet I forget not thee .
What will you do with me ?
Thou shalt be plac'dAt my mans house , and have such food and raimentAs can be bought with money : these white handsShall never learn to work , but they shall playAs thou say'st they were wont , teaching the stringsTo move in order , or what else thou wilt .
I thank you , Sir , but pray you cloath me poorly , And let my labor get me means to live .
But fair one , you , I know do so much hateA foul ingratitude , you will not lookI should do this for nothing .
I will work as much out as I can , and take as little , That you shall have as duely paid to youAs ever servant did .
But give me now a trial o n't , I may believeWe are alone , shew me how thou wilt kissAnd hug me hard , when I have stolen awayFrom my too clamorous wife that watches me , To spend a blessed hour or t [ w ] o with thee .
Is this the love you mean ? you would have thatIs not in me to give , you would have lust .
Not to dissemble , or to mince the word , 'T is Lust I wish indeed .
And by my troth I have it not : for heavens sake useme kindly.Though I be good , and shew perhaps a monster , As this world goes .
I doBut speak to thee , thy answers are thy own , I compel none , but if [ thou ] refuse this motion , Thou art not then for me , alas good soul ; What profit can thy work bring me ?
But I fear , I pray goe , for lust they say , will growOutragious , being deni 'd , I give you thanksFor all your courtesies , and there 's a JewelThat 's worth the taking , that I did preserveSafe from the robbers , pray you leave me hereJust as you found me , a poor innocent , And Heaven will bless you for it .
Pretty maid , I am no Robber , nor no Ravisher , I pray thee keep thy Jewel , I have doneNo wrong to thee , though thou beest virtuousAnd in extremity , I do not know , That I am bound to keep thee .
No Sir , for gods sake , if you know an honest man in all theseCountreys , give me some directions to find him out .
More honest than my self , good sooth I do not know ; I wouldhave lain with thee , with thy consent , and who would not in all theseparts , is past my memory , I am sorry for thee , farewel gentle maid , God keep thee safe. [ Exit .
I thank you Sir , and you ; Woman they say , was only made of man , Methinks 't is strange they should be so unlike , It may be all the best was cut awayTo make the woman , and the naught was leftBehind with him , I 'll sit me down and weep , All things have cast me from 'em but the earth ; The evening comes , and every little flowerDroops now , as well as I .
Good Madge lets rest a little , by my troth I am weary , thisnew pail is a plaguy heavy one , would Tom were hang 'd for choosingit , 't is the untoward'st fool in a Countrey .
With all my heart , and I thank you too , Nan .
What true contented happiness dwels here , More than in Cities ! wou 'd to God my FatherHad liv 'd like one of these , and bred me upTo milk : and do as they do : methinks'Tis a life that I wou 'd choose , if I were nowTo tell my time agen , above a Princes ; maids , for charityGive a poor wench one draught of Milk , That weariness and hunger have nigh famish 'd .
If I had but one Cows Milk in all the world , you should havesome o n't ; there , drink more , the Cheese shall pay for it , alas poorheart , she 's drie .
Do you dwell here abouts ?
No , would I did .
Madge , if she does not looke like my cosin Sue o'th ' Moorlane , as one thing can look like another --
Nay , Sue has a hazle eye , I know Sue well , and by yourleave , not so trim a body neither , this is a feat bodied thing I tellyou .
She laces close by the mass I warrant you , and so does Suetoo .
I thank you for your gentleness , fair maids .
Drink agen pray thee .
I am satisfied , and heaven reward thee for't , yet thus far Iwill compell you to accept these trifles , toys only that express mythanks , for greater worth , I 'm sure they have not in them ; indeed youshall , I found 'em as I came .
Madge , look you here Madge .
Nay , I have as fine a one as you , mine 's all gold , andpainted , and a precious stone i n't ; I warrant it cost a crown wench .
But mine is the most sumptuous one , that e'r I saw .
One favour you must do me more , for you are well acquaintedhere .
Uds me , our Dorothy went away but last week , and I know mymistriss want 's a maid , and why may she not be plac 'd there ? this is alikely wench , I tell you truly , and a good wench I warrant her .
And 't is a hard case if we that have serv 'd four years apiece , can not bring in one servant , we will prefer her ; hark you sister , praywhat 's your name .
Melvia .
A feat name i'faith ; and can you milk a cow ? and make amerry-bush ? that 's nothing .
I shall learn quickly .
But be sure to keep the men out , they will mar all that youmake else , I know that by my self ; for I have been So touz 'd among 'emin my days , come you shall e'en home with us , and be our fellow , ourhouse is so honest , and we serve a very good woman , and a Gentlewoman , and we live as merrily , and dance a good daies after even-song : ourWake shall be on Sunday ; do you know what a Wake is ? we have mightycheer then , and such a coil , 'twould bless ye ; you must not be sobashful , you 'll spoil all .
Let 's home for Gods sake , my Mistriss thinks by this time weare lost , come , we 'll have a care of you , I warrant you ; but you musttell my Mistress where you were born , and every thing that belongs toyou , and the strangest things you can devise , for she loves thoseextreamly , 't is no matter whether they be true or no , she 's not soscrupulous ; you must be our Sister , and love us best , and tell usevery thing , and when cold weather comes , we 'll lye together , willyou do this ?
Yes .
Then home again o ' gods name , can you go apace .
I warrant you. [ Exeunt .
Pedro and Uberto , severally .
How now , any good news yet ?
Faith not any yet .
This comes o ' tipling ; would 'twere treason and't pleas [ 'd ] God , to drink more than three draughts at a meal .
When did you see Richardo ?
I crost him twice to day .
You have heard of a young wench that was seen last [ night ] .
Yes .
Has Richard heard of this ?
Yes , and I think he 's ridden after , farewel , I 'll have anotherround .
If you hear any thing , pray spare no horse-flesh , I 'll do the like .
Do. [ Exeunt .
Richardo and Valerio .
Sir , I did think 't was you by all descriptions .
'T is so , I took her up indeed , the manner howYou have heard already , and what she had about her , As Jewels , Gold , and other trifling things : And what my end was , which because she slighted , I left her there i'th ' fields .
Left i'th ' fields ? could any but a RogueThat had despis 'd humanity and goodness , [ God , ] law and credit ; and had set himselfTo lose his noblest part , and be a beast , Have left so innocent unmatch 'd a virtue , To the rude mercy of a wilderness ?
Sir , if you come to rail , pray quit my house , I do not use to have such language givenWithin my doors to me ; for your wench , You may go seek her with more patience , She 's tame enough , I warrant you .
Pray forgive me.I do confess my much forgetfulness ; And weigh my words no farther , I beseech you , Then a mere madness , for such a grief has seiz 'd meSo strong and deadly , as a punishment , And a just one too , That 't is a greater wonder I am living , Than any thing I utter ; yet let me tell you thus much , 'T was a fault for leaving herSo in the fields .
Sir , I will think so now , and credit me , You have so wrought me with your grief , that IDo both forgive and pity you : And if you 'll please to take a bed this night here ; To morrow I 'll bring you where I left her .
I thank you , [ no , ] shall I be so unworthy : To think upon a bed , or ease , or comfort , And have my heart stray from me , God knows where , Cold and forsaken , destitute of friends , And all good comforts else , unless some treeWhose speechless charity must better ours , With which the bitter east winds made their sportAnd sung through hourly , hath invited herTo keep off half a day ? shall she be thus , And I draw in soft slumbers ? God forbid.No , night and bitter coldness , I provoke thee , And all the dews that hang upon thy locks , Showrs , Hails , Snows , Frosts , and two edged Winds that primeThe maiden blossoms , I provoke you all , And dare expose this body to your sharpness , Till I be made a Land-mark .
Will you then stay and eat with me ?
Y'are angry with me , I know y'are angry , You would not bid me eat else ; my poor Mistriss , For ought I know thou'rt famish 'd , for what elseCan the fields yield thee , and the stubborn season , That yet holds in the fruit ? good gentle Sir , Think not ill manners in me for denyingYour offer 'd meat , for sure I can not eatWhile I do think she wants ; well I 'm a rascal ; A villain , slave , that only was begotten , To murder women , and of them the best .
This is a strange affliction.If you 'll accept no greater courtesie , yet drink Sir .
Now I am sure you hate me , and you knewWhat kind of man I am , as indeed 't is fit , That every man should know me to avoid me.If you have peace within you , Sir , or goodnessName that abhord word - Drink , no more unto me , You had safer strike me.I pray you do not , if you love me do not .
Sir , I mean no ill by it .
It may be so , Nor let me seeNone Sir , if you love heaven ; You know not what offence it is unto me , Nor good now do not ask me why : And I warn you once again , let no man else speak of't , I fear your servants will be prating to me .
Why Sir , what ail you ?
I hate drink , there 's the end o n't , And that man that drinks with meat is damn'dWithout an age of prayers and repentance , And there 's a hazard too ; good Sir , no moreIf you will do me a free courtesie ; That I shall know for one : go take your horse , And bring me to the place where you left her:
Since you are so impo [ r ] tunate , I will ; But I will wish Sir , you had staid to nightUpon my credit you shall see no drink .
Be gone , the hearing of it makes me giddy , Sir , will you be intreated to forbear it , I shall be mad else .
I pray no more of that , I am quiet , I 'll but walk in , and away straight .
Now I thank you , But what you do , do in a twinkling , Sir .
As soon as may be. [ Exit .
, Viola , and two Milk-maids .
Is this the wench you have brought me ? some catch I warrant.How daringly she looks upon the matter !
Yes forsooth , this is the maiden .
Come hither , wou 'd you serve ?
If it shall please you to accept my service , I hope I shall dosomething that shall like you , though it be but truth , and oftenpraying for you .
You are very curious of your hand methinks , You preserve it so with gloves , let me see it ; I marry , here 's a hand of march-pane , wenches , This pretty palme never knew sorrow yet ; How soft it is I warrant you , and supple : O ' my word , this is fitter for a pocket to filch withalThan to [ work ] , I fear me little one , You are no better than you should be ; goe to .
My Conscience yet is but one witness to me , And that heaven knows , is of mine innocence , 'T is true , I must confess with shame enough , The time that I have led , yet never taught meWhat 't was to break a sleep , or to be weary .
You can say well : if you be mine , wench , you must doe welltoo , for words are but slow workers , yet so much hope I have of you , that I 'll take you , so you 'll be diligent , and do your duty : how now ?
Alexander .
There is a messenger come from your son , That brings you word he is return 'd from travel , And will be here this night .
Now joy upon thee for it , thou art everA bringer of good tidings , there , drink that : In troth thou hast much contented me , my Son ! Lord how thou hast pleas 'd me , shall I see my SonYet e'r I dye ? take care my house be handsome , And the new stools set out , and boughs and rushes , And flowers for the window , and the Turky Carpet , And the great parcel Salt , Nan , with the Cruets , And prethee Alexander goe to the Cook , And bid him spare for nothing , my son 's come home , Who 's come with him ?
I hear of none yet , but a Gentlewoman .
A Gentlewoman ? what Gentlewoman ?
I know not , but such a one there is , he says .
Pray God he have not cast away himselfUpon some snout-fair piece , I do not like it .
No sure , my Master has more discretion .
[ Well , ] be it how it will , he shall be welcome.Sirs to your tasks , and shew this little noviceHow to bestir her self , I 'll sort out things. [ Exit .
We will forsooth , I can tell you , my Mistriss is a stirringwoman .
Lord how she 'll talk sometimes ! 't is the maddest cricket --
Methinks she talks well , and shews a great deal of goodhuswivery , pray let me deck the chambers , shall I ?
Yes , you shall , but do not scorn to be advis 'd , Sister , forthere belongs more to that , than you are aware on ; why [ w ] ould youventure so fondly upon the strowings ? there 's mighty matters in themI 'll assure you , and in the spreading of a bough-pot , you may miss , ifyou were ten years elder , if you take not a special care before you .
I will learn willingly , if that be all .
Sirrah where is't they say my young Master hath been ?
Faith I know not , beyond the Sea , where they are born withoutnoses .
[ Jesse blesse ] us ! without noses ? how do they do forhandkerchiefs ?
So Richard says , and sirrah , their feet stand in theirforeheads .
That 's fine by my troth , these men have pestilent running headsthen ; do they speak as we do ?
No , they never speak .
Are they cursend ?
No , they call them Infidels , I know not what they are .
Sirrah , we shall have fine courting now my young master is comehome , were you never courted Sister ?
Alas , I know it not .
What is that courting , sirrah ?
I can tell , for I was once courted in the matted chamber , youknow the party Madge , faith he courted finely .
Pray thee what is't ?
Faith , nothing but he was somewhat figent with me , faith 'tisfine sport , this courting .
Where be the Maids there ?
We shall be hang 'd anon , away good wenches , and have a careyou dight things handsomly , I will look over you. [ Exeunt .

If your sorrow will give you so far leave , pray think your selfmost welcome to this place , for so upon my life you are , and for yourown fair sake , take truce awhile with these immoderate mournings .
I thank you Sir , I shall doe what I may ; Pray lead me to a chamber .
Alexander .
Presently , Before your blessing Mother , I intreat yeTo know this Gentlewoman , and bid her welcome , The virtuous wife of him that was my selfIn all my travels .
Indeed she is most welcome , so are you son [ kneel.Now all my blessing on thee ; thou hast made meYounger by 20 years , than I was yesterday , Will you walk in ? what ails this Gentlewoman ? Alas , I fear she is not well , good Gen [ t ] lewoman .
You fear right .
She has fasted over long , You shall have supper presently o'th ' board .
She will not eat ; I can assure you Mother , For Gods sake let your Maid conduct her upInto some fair becoming ChamberFit for a woman of her Being , andAs soon as may be , I know she 's very ill , and wou 'd have rest .
There is one ready for her , the blew chamber .
'T is well , I 'll lead you to your chamber doorAnd there I 'll leave you to your quiet , Mistriss .

Where are these maids , attend upon the Gentlewoman , and seeshe want no good thing in the house ? goodnight with all my heartforsooth , good Lord how you are grown , is he not Alexander ?
Yes truly , he 's shot up finely , God be thanked .
An ill weed , Mother , will do so .
You say true , Sir , an ill weed grows apace .
Alexander the sharp , you take [ me ] very quickly .
Nay , I can tell you , Alexander will do it , do you readmadcap still ?
Sometimes forsooth .
But faith Son , what Countreys have you travell 'd ?
Why many , Mother , as they lay before me , France , Spain,
and Germany , and other Provinces that I am sure , you are notbetter 'd by , when you hear of them .
And can you these tongues perfectly ?
Of some a little , Mother .
Pray spout some French Son .
You understand it not , and to your ears 'twill goe like anunshod cart upon the stones , only a rough unhandsome sound .
[ Faith ] I would fain hear some French .
Good Sir , speak some French to my Mistriss .
At your intreaty Alexander , I will , who shall I speak to ?
If your worship will do me the favour Sir , to me .

Did not [ you sweare ] right .
Yes good Alexander , if you had done so too , But good Mother , I am very hungry , and have rid far to day , and amfasting .
You shall have your supper presently , my sweet Son .
As soon as you please , which once ended , I 'll go and visit yo [ n ] sick Gentlewoman .
Come then. [ Exeunt .
Antonio like a Post , with a Letter .
I have ridden like a fury , to make up this work , and I will doit bravely , e'r I leave it ; this is the house I am sure .
Alexander .
Who wou 'd you speak with , Sir ?
Marry Sir , I would speak with a Gentlewoman , came this nightlate here from the City , I have some Letters of importance to her , I am a Post Sir , and would be dispa [ t ] ch 'd in haste .
Sir , can not I deliver 'em ? for the truth is , she 's ill , andin her chamber .
Pray pardon me , I must needs speak with her , my business is soweighty .
I 'll tell her so , and bring you present word .
Pray do so , and I 'll attend her , pray god the grief of myimagined death , spoil not what I intend , I hope it will not .
Though she be very ill , and desires no trouble , Yet if your business be so urgent , you may come up and speak with her .
I thank you Sir , I follow you. [ Exit Alex .
What should this fellow be i'th ' name of Heaven , that comeswith such post business ? sure my Husband hath reveal 'd himself , and inthis haste sent after me , are you the Post my friend ?
Anto [ n ] io .
Yes forsooth Mistriss .
What good news hast thou brought me gentle Post ? For I have woe and grief too much already .
I would you had less , Mistriss , I could wish it , beshrew myheart she moves me cruelly .
Have I found you once more Jugler ? well Jewel , thou hast onlyvirtue in thee , of all I read of yet ; what ears has this ass to betrayhim with ? well , what 's your business then ?
I have brought a Letter from your servant , Mistriss , in haste .
Pray give it me , I hope the best still .
This is the upshot , and I know I have hit it , Well , if the spirits of the dead do walk , I shallHear more of this one hundred years hence .
By any means you must have special care , for now the City ispossest for certain , my Master is made away , which for ought I know is [ a ] truth indeed ; good Mistriss leave your grief , and see your danger , and let that wise and noble Gentleman with whom you are , be your righthand in all things .
Now do I know I have the better o n't , by the languishing of hereye at this near instant , 't is still simming in her blood , in coyningsomewhat to turn Mercury , I know it .
He is my Husband , and 't is reasonable he should command in allthings , since he will be an ass against the hair , at his own peril beit , in the morn you shall have a pacquet , till when , I must intreatyou stay , you shall not lose by it .
I do not doubt it , Mistriss ; I 'll leave you to your rest , andwait your pleasure .
Do , and seek out the Gentleman of the house , bid him come tome presently .
Who , Mr. Mercury ?
Do you know him , Post ?
Only by sight forsooth , now I remember your servant will 'd meto let you know he is the only man , you [ and ] your fortunes , are nowto rest upon .
Prethee no more , I know all this already .
I 'll take my leave now , I am made for ever. [ Exit .
Good night , I am provided for you , my fine youth. [ Exit .
Viola , Alexander with a broken Glass .
I 'll make thee have more care .
Good Mistriss pardon me .
Thou'lt ne'r be good I warrant thee , can your fine fingershold no faster ?
Indeed it was against my will .
Alexander , let 's see the glass , as I am true kirsome woman , it is one of the chrystal glasses my Cosin sent me , and the baggagehath broke it where it can not be mended , Alexander , can Humphreymend this think you ?
No truly , this will ne'er be mended .
Truly I meant but to wash it for the Gentlewoman that is sickabove , and shaking out the water , knockt it against the pail side .
Did you so ? be sure I 'll stop it , 'twill make a good gap inyour quarters wages , I can tell you .
I pray forgive me , and let me have no wages this firstquarter .
Go whimling , and fetch two or three grating loaves out of theKitching , to make Ginger-bread of , 't is such an untoward thing. [ Exit Viola .
She 's somewhat simple indeed , she knew not what a kimnel was , she wants good nurture mightily .
My Son tells me , Alexander , that this young widow means tosojourn here , she offers largely for her board , I may offer her goodcheer , prethee make a step i'th ' morning down to the Parsonage forsome Pigeons ; what are you mad there ? what noise is that ? are you atbowls within ? why do you whine ?
Viola weeping .
I have done another fault , I beseech you sweet Mistriss forgiveme .
What 's the matter ?
As I was reaching for the bread that lay upon the shelf , I havethrown down the minc 'd meat , that should have made the pies to morrow .
Get thee out of my house , thou filthy destroying Harlot , thou , I 'll not keep thee an hour longer .
Good Mistriss , beat me rather for my fault , as much as itdeserves , I do not know whither to go .
No I warrant thee , out of my doors .
Indeed I 'll mend , I pray speak you for me .
If thou hadst hurl 'd down any thing but the Pie-meat , I wouldhave spoke for thee , but I can not find in my heart now .
Art thou here yet ? I think I must have an Officer to thrustthee out of my doors , must I ?
Why , you may stop this in my wages too , For God 's sake do , I 'll find my self this year ; And let me stay .
Thou't spoil ten times as much , I 'll cudgel thee out of mydoors .
I am assur 'd you are more merciful , Than thus to beat me and discharge me too .
Dost thou dispute with me , Alexander carry the pratinghilding forth .
Good Mistriss hear me , I have here a Jewel , My Mother left me , and 't is something worth : Receive it , and when all my faults togetherCome to the worth of that , then turn me forth , Till then I pray you keep me .
What giggombob have we here ? pray god you have not pilfredthis somewhere , th'art such a puling thing , wipe your eyes , and rise , go your ways , Alexander , bid the Cook mince some more meat , come , and get you to bed quickly , that you may up betime i'th ' morning amilking , or you and I shall fall out worse yet.

She has hurt my arm ; I am afraid she is a very angry woman , butbless him heaven that did me the most wrong , I am afraid Antonio'swife should see me , she will know me .
Melvia .
I am coming , she 's not angry agen I hope. [ Exit .
Mercury .
Now what am I the better for enjoyingThis woman that I lov 'd so ? all I find , That I before imagined to be happy : Now I have done , it turns to nothing elseBut a poor pitied , and a base repentance , Udsfoot , I am monstrous angry with my self : Why should a man that has discourse and reason , And knows how near he loses all in these things , Covet to have his wishes satisfied ; Which when they are , are nothing but the shameI do begin to loath this woman strangely , And I think justly too , that durst adventure , Flinging away her modesty to takeA stranger to her bed , her Husbands bodyBeing scarce cold in the earth for her content , It was no more to take my senses withThan if I had an idle dream in sleepYet I have made her promises : which grieves me , And I must keep 'em too , I think she hunts me : The devil can not keep these women off , When they are fletched once .
To bed for gods sake Sir , why do you stay here ? Some are up i'th ' house , I heard the wife , Good dear sweet-heart to bed .
Why , I am going ! why do you follow me ? You would not have it known I hope , pray get youBack to your chamber , the doors hard by for me , Let me alone , I warrant you this it isTo thresh well , I have got a customer , Will you go to bed ?
Will you ?
Yes , I am going .
Then remember your promise you made to marry me .
I will , but it was your fault , that it cameTo this pinch now , that it must need remembrance : For out of honesty I offer 'd youTo marry you first , why did you slack that offer ?
Alas I told you the inconvenience of it , And what wrong it would appear to the worldIf I had married [ you ] in such post-hasteAfter his death : beside , the foolish peopleWould have been bold to have thought we had lain togetherin his time , and like enough imagin'dWe two had murther 'd him .
I love her tongue yet , If I were a SaintA gilded Saint , and such a thing as thisShould prate thus wittily and feelinglyUnto my Holiness , I can not tell , But I fear shrewdly I should do somethingThat would quite scratch me out o'th ' Kalender , And if I stay longer talking with her , Though I am mad at what I have done already , Yet I shall forget my self again ; I feel the DevilReady to hold my stirrop ; pray to bed , good night .
This kiss , good night sweet Love , And peace goe with thee : thou hast prov 'd thy selfThe honestest man that ever was entic'dTo that sweet sin as people please to call it , Of lying with anothers wife , and I , I think the honestest woman without blushing , That ever lay with another man , I sent my HusbandInto a Cellar , post , fearing , and justlyHe should have known him , which I did not purposeTill I had had my end.Well , now this plot is perfect , let him brag on't. [ Exit .
Curio with a Paper .
Birlady Sir , you have rid hard that you have .
They that have business , must do so , I take it .
You say true , when set you out my friend ?
About ten a clock , and I have rid all night .
By the mass you are tough indeed , I have seen the day , I wouldhave rid too with the proudest of them , and fling dirt in their faces , and I have do n't with this foolish boy , Sir , many a time ; but what canlast always ? 't is done , 't is done now , Sir , age , care , and office , brings us to our footcloaths , the more the pity .
I believe that , Sir , but will it please you to read thebusiness ?
My friend , I can read , and I can tell you when .
Would I could too Sir , for my haste requires it .
Whence comes it do you say ?
Sir from the City .
Oh from the City , 't is a reverent place .
And his justice be as short as his memory , A Dudgion Dagger will serve him to mow down sin withal , What clod-pole Commissioner is this ?
And by my faith , govern 'd by worthy members , Discreet and upright .
Sir , they are beholding to you , you have given some of them acommendations , they were not worthy of this twenty years .
Go to , go to , you have a merry meaning , I have found you Sir , i ' faith , you are a wag , away , fie now I 'll read Your Letter .
Pray do Sir ; what a misery 'tisTo have an urgent business wait the JusticeOf such an old Tuff-taffata that knows not , Nor can be brought to understand more sence , Than how to restore supprest Alehouses , And have his man compound small trespasses , For ten groats .
Sir , it seems here your business is of a deeper circumstancethan I conceiv 'd it for ; what do you mean , Sir ?
'T is for mine own ease I 'll assure your Worship .
It shall not be i ' faith friend , here I have it , That one Antonio a Gentleman , I take it so , Yes , it is so , a Gentleman is lately thought toHave been made away , and by my faith , upon aPearls ground too , if you consider ; well , there'sKnavery i n't , I see that without spectacles .
Sure this fellow deals in revelation , he 's so hidden , Goe thy ways , thou wilt stick a bench spit as formally , And shew thy Agot , and hatch 'd chainAs well as the best of them .
And now I have consider 'd , I believe it .
What Sir ?
That he was murdered .
Did you know him ?
No .
Nor how it is suppos 'd .
No , nor I care not two-pence , those are toys and yet I verilybelieve he was murdered , as sure as I believe thou art a man , I neverfail 'd in these things yet , w'are a man that 's beaten to thesematters , experience is a certain conceal 'd thing that fails not : praylet me ask you one thing , why do you come to me ?
Because the Letter is addrest to you , being the nearestJustice .
The nearest ? is that all ?
I think it be Sir , I would be loth you should be the wisest .
Well Sir , as it is , I will endeavour in it ; yet if it had cometo me by name , I know not , but I think it had been as soon dispatchtas by another , and with as round a wisdom , I , and as happily , butthat 's all one : I have born this place this thirty years , and upwards , and with sufficient credit , and they may when they please , know mebetter ; to the nearest ? well .
Sir , it is not my fault , for had I known you sooner --
I thank you Sir , I know it .
I 'll be sworn you should have plaid for [ any ] business now .
And further , they have specified unto me , his Wife is sorelysuspected in this matter , as a main cause .
I think she be Sir , for no other cause can be yet found .
And one Mercury a traveller , with whom they say directly sheis run away , and as they think this way .
I knew all this before .
Well Sir , this Mercury I know , and his breeding , a neighborschild hard by , you have been happy , Sir , in coming hither .
Then you know where to have him , Sir ?
I do Sir , he dwells near me .
I doubt your Worship dwels near a knave then .
I think so ; pray put on : but 't is a wonderTo see how graceless people are now given , And how base virtue is accounted with themThat should be all in all , as says a wise man.I tell you Sir , and it is true , that there have been such murthers , and of late days , as 'twould make your very heart bleed in you , andsome of them as I shall be enabled , I will tell you , it fell out oflate days .
It may be so , but will it please you to proceed in this ?
An honest Weaver , and as good a workman , as e'er shot shuttle , and as close : but every man must dye ; this honest Weaver being alittle mellow in his Ale , that was the evidence verbatim , Sir , Godbless the mark , sprung his neck just in this place : well Jarvis , thou hadst wrongs , and if I live some of the best shall sweat for't , then a wench --
But Sir , you have forgot my business .
A sober pretty maid about 17 , they say , certainly , howsoever'tis shuffled , she burst her self , and fondly , if it be so , withFurmety at a Churching , but I think the Devil had another agent i n't : either of which , if I can catch , shall stretch for't .
This is a mad Justice that will hang the Devil ; but I would youwould be short in this , before that other notice can be given .
Sir , I will doe discreetly what is fitting ; what , Antonio ?
Your Worship .
Put on your best coat , and let your fellow Mark goe to theConstable , and bid him aid me with all the speed he can , and all thepower , and provide Pen and Ink to take their confessions , and my long
Yes , what else ? I came to that end to accuse both parties .
May I crave what you are ?
Faith Sir , one that to be known would not profit you , more thana near kinsman of the dead Antonio 's .
'T is well , I am sorry for my neighbor , truly , that he had nomore grace , 'twill kill his Mother ; she 's a good old woman , will youwalk in ? I 'll but put my cloak on , and my chain off , and a clean band , and have my shooes blackt over , and shift my Jerkin , and we 'll to ourbusiness , and you shall see how I can bolt these matters .
As soon as't please you , Sir. [ Exit .
Valerio , and Richardo .
This is the place ; here did I leave the MaidAlone last night , drying her tender eyes , Uncertain what to do , and yet desirousTo have me gone .
How rude are all we men , That take the name of Civil to our selves ! If she had set her foot upon an earthWhere people live that we call barbarous ; Though they had had no house to bring her to , They would have spoil 'd the glory , that the springHas deckt the trees in , and with willing handsHave torn their branches down , and every manWould have become a builder for her sake.What time left you her there ?
I left her , when the Sun had so much to sett , As he is now got from his place of rise .
So near the night she could not wander far ; Fair Viola !
It is in vain to call , she sought a houseWithout all question .
Peace , fair Viola ? Fair Viola ? who should have left her hereOn such a ground ? if you had meant to lose her , You might have found there were no ecchos hereTo take her name , and carry it about , When her true Lover came to mourn for her , Till all the neighboring valleys and the hills , Resounded Viola , -- And such a place , You should have chose -- You pity us becauseThe dew a little wets our feet , Unworthy far to seek her in the wet ; And what becomes of her ? where wandred she , With two showers raining on her , from her eyesContinually , abundantly , from whichThere 's neither tree nor house to shelter her ; Will you go with me to travel ?
Whither ?
Over all the world .
No by my faith , I 'll make a shorter journeyWhen I do travel .
But there 's no hopeTo gain my end in any shorter way .
Why , what 's your end ?
It is to search the earth , Till we have found two in the shapes of men , As wicked as our selves .
'Twere not so hard to find out those .
Why , if we find them out , It were the better , for what brave villany , Might we four do ? we wou 'd not keep together : For every one has treachery enoughFor twenty countreys , one should trouble Asia , Another should sow strife in Africa ; But you should play the knave , in at home in Europe , And for America let me alone .
Sir , I am honester , Than you know how to be , and can no moreBe wrong 'd , but I shall find my self aright .
If you had any spark of honesty , You would not think that honester than I , Were a praise high enough to serve your turn : If men were commonly so bad as I , Thieves would be put in Calendars for Saints ; And bones of murderers would work miracles.I am a kind of knave , of knave so muchThere is betwixt me , and the vilest else -- But the next place of all to mine is yours .
Viola with pails .
That last is she , 't is she .
Let us away , we shall infect her , let her have the wind , And we will kneel down here .
Wenches away , for here are men .
Fair maid , I pray you stay .
Alas , agen ?
Why do you lay hold on her ? I pray heartily let her go .
With all my heart , I do not mean to hurt her .
But stand away then for the purest bodiesWill soonest take infection , stand away , But for infecting her my self , by heaven , I would come there , and beat thee further off .
I know that voice and face .
You are finely mad , g [ o ] dbwy Sir , now you are here together , I 'll leave [ y ] ou so , god send you good luck , both ; when you aresoberer , you 'll give me thanks. [ Exit .
Wilt thou go milk ? come .
Why dost not come ?
She nods , she 's asleep .
What wert up so early ?
I think yon man 's mad to kneel there , nay [ come ] away , udsbody , Nan , help , she looks black i'th face , She 's in a sound .
And you be a man , come hither , and help a woman .
Come thither ? you are a fool .
And you a knave and a beast that you are .
Come hither , 't was my being now so near , That made [ her ] swound , and you are wicked people , Or you wou 'd do so too ; my venom eyesStrike innocency dead at such a distance , Here I 'll kneel , for this is out of distance .
Th'art a prating ass , there 's no goodness in thee , I warrant , how dost thou ?
Why ? well .
Art thou able to go ?
No , pray go you and milk , if I be able to comeI 'll follow you , if not , Til sit here , Till you come back .
I am loth to leave thee here with yon wild fool .
I know him well , I warrant thee he will not hurt me .
Come then Nan. [ Exeunt Maids .
How do you ? be not fearfull , for I hold my handsBefore my mouth , and speak , and soMy breath can never blast you .
'T was enough to use me ill , though you had never sought me tomock me , why kneel you so far off , were not that gesture better us'din prayer , had I dealt so with you , I should not sleep , till [ God ] andyou had both forgiven me .
I do not mock , nor lives there such a villainThat can do any thing contemptibleTo you , but I do kneel , because it isAn action very fit and reverent , In presence of so pure a creature , And so far off , as fearful to offend , One too much wrong 'd already .
You confess you did the fault , yet scorn to come , So far as hither , to ask pardon for't ; Which I could willingly afford to come , To you to grant , good Sir if you haveA better love , may you be blest together.She shall not wish you better than I will , I but offend you , there are all the JewelsI stole , and all the love I ever had , I leave behind with you , I 'll carry noneTo give another may the next maid you tryLove you no worse , nor be no worse than I .
Do not leave me yet for all my fault , Search out the next things to impossible , And put me on them when they are effected , I may with better modesty receiveForgiveness from you .
I will set no pennance , To gain the great forgiveness you desire : But to come hither and take me and it , Or else I 'll come and beg , so you will grant , That you will be content to be forgiven .
Nay , I will come since you [ will ] have it so , And since you please to pardon me I hopeFree from infection , here I am by you ; A careless man , a breaker of my faith , A lothsome drunkard ; and in that wild fury : A hunter after whores : I do beseech you , To pardon all these faults , and take me upAn honest , sober , and a faithful man .
For [ gods ] sake , urge your faults no more , but mend , All the forgiveness I can make you , is , To love you , which I will do , and desireNothing but love again , which if I have notYet I will love you still .
Oh Women , that some one of you will take , An everlasting pen into your hands : And grave in paper which the writ shall make , More lasting than the marble Monuments , Your matchless virtues to posterities : Which the defective race of envious man , Strive to conceal .
Methinks I would not now for any thing , But you had mist me , I have made a story , Will serve to waste many a winters fireWhen we are old , I 'll [ tell ] my daughters then , The miseries their Mother had in love : And say , my girls be wiser , yet I would notHave had more wit my self , take up those Jewels , For I think I hear my fellows coming .
How dost thou now ?
Why , very well I thank you , 't is late , shall I haste home ?
I prethee we shall be shent soundly .
Why does that railing man goe with us ?
I prethee speak well of him , on my word , He 's an honest man .
There was never any so one 's complexion , a Gentleman ? I'de be asham 'd to have such a foul mouth. [ Exeunt .
, Alexander , Andrugio , and his man Rowland .
How now Alexander , what Gentleman is this ?
Indeed forsooth I know not , I found him at the market full ofwoe , crying a lost daughter , and telling all her tokens to the people ; and what you wot ? by all subscription in the world , it should be ournew Maid Melvia , one would little think it , therefore I was bold totell him of her Mistriss .
Melvia ? It can not be , fool , alas you know she is a poorwench , and I took her in upon mere charity .
So seem 'd my daughter when she went away , as she had made herself .
What stature was your child of , Sir ?
Not high , and of a brown complexion , Her Hair aborn , a round face , which some friends that flattered me , would say 'twould be a good one .
This is still Melvia , Mistriss , that 's the truth o n't .
It may be so , I 'll promise you .
Well , goe thy ways , the flower of our Town , for a hand and afoot , I shall never see thy fellow .
But had she not such toyes , as Bracelets , Rings , and Jewels ?
She was something bold indeed , to take such things that nightshe left me .
Then belike she run away ?
Though she be one I love , I dare not lye , she did indeed .
What think you of this Jewel ?
Yes , this was one of them , and this was mine , you have made mea new man , I thank you for it .
Nay , and she be given to filching , there is your Jewel , I amclear o n't : but by your leave , Sir , you shall answer me for what islost since she came hither , I can tell you , there lye thingsscattering in every place about the house .
As I am virtuous , I have the lyingst old Gentlewoman to myMistriss , and the most malicious , the devil a good word will she givea servant , that 's her old rule ; and God be thanked , they 'll give heras few , there is perfect love on both sides , it yearns my heart to [ heare ] the wench misconstrued , a careful soul she is , I 'll be swornfor her , and when she 's gone , let them say what they will , they maycast their caps at such another .
What you have lost by her , with all my heartI 'll see you double paid for , you have say'dWith your kind pity , two that must not liveUnless it be to thank you ; take this Jewel , This strikes off none of her offences , Mistriss , Would I might see her .
Alexander , run , and bid her make haste home , she 's at themilking Close ; but tell her not by any means who 's here , I know she'llbe too fearful .
Well , we 'll have a posset yet at parting , that 's my comfort , and one round , or else I 'll lose my Will. [ Exit .
You shall find Silvio , Uberto , and Pedro enquiring forthe Wench at the next Town , tell them she is found , and where I am , and with the favor of this Gentlewoman , desire them to come hither .
I pray do , they shall be all welcome. [ Exit Serv .
Curio , and Mark .
By your leave forsooth , you shall see me find the parties by aslight .
Who 's that , Mr. Justice ? how do you , Sir ?
Why , very well , and busie , where 's your Son ?
He 's within , Sir .
Hum , and how does the young woman my Cosin , that came downwith him .
She 's above , as a woman in her case may be .
You have confest it ? then sirrah call in the Officers : she'sno Cosin of mine ; a mere trick to discover all .
To discover ? what ?
Mark and Officers .
You shall know that anon : I think [ you ] have overreached you ; oh welcome , enter the house , and by virtue of my warrant which youhave there , seize upon the bodily persons of those whose names arethere written , to wit , one Mercury , and the wife of one Antonio .
For what .
Away I say , This Gentleman shall certifie you for what. [ Ex. Officer .
He can accuse my Son of nothing , he came from travel butwithin these two days .
There hangs a tale .
I should be sorry this should fall out at any time : butespecially now Sir ; will you favour me so much , as to let me know ofwhat you accuse him ?
Upon suspition of murther .
Murther ? I defie thee .
I pray God he may prove himself innocent .
Fie , say not so , you shew your self to be no goodCommon-wealths man : for the more are hang 'd the better 't is for theCommon-wealth .
By this rule you were best hang your self .
I forgive your honest mirth ever : Oh welcome , welcome Mark .
Mark and Officers , with Mercury and the Wife.Your Pen , Ink , and Paper , to take their examinations .
Why do you pull me so ? I 'll go alone .
Let them stand , let them stand quietly , whilst they areexamin 'd ?
What will you examine us of ?
Of Antonio 's murther .
Why , he was my friend .
He was my Husband .
The more shame for you both ; Mark , your Pen and Ink .
Pray God all be well , I never knew any of these travellerscome to good ; I beseech you , Sir , be favourable to my Son .
Gentlewoman , hold you content , I would it were come to that !
For gods sake mother , why kneel you to such a pig-brib'dfellow ? he has surfeited of Geese , and they have put him into a fit ofJustice ; let him do his worst .
Is your paper ready ?
I am ready , Sir .
Antonio .
Accuse them , Sir , I command thee to lay down accusationsagainst these persons , in behalf of the State , and first look upon theparties to be accus 'd , and deliver your name .
My name is Curio , my murthered kinsmanIf he were living now , I should not know him , 'T is so long since we saw one another .
My Cosin Curio ?
But thus much from the mouths of his servants , and others , whose examinations I have in writing about me , I can accuse them of ; this Mercury , the last night , but this last , lay in Antonio'shouse , and in the night he rose , raising Antonio , where privatelythey were in talk an hour , to what end I know not : but of likelyhood , finding Antonio 's house not a fit place to murder him in , hesuffered him to go to bed again , but in the morning early , he train'dhim I think forth , after which time he never saw his home ; his cloathswere found near the place where Mercury was , and the people at firstdenyed they saw him : but at last he made a friv [ o ] lous tale , thatthere he shifted himself into a Footmans habit : but in short , the nexthour this woman went to Mercury , and in her Coach they postedhither ; true accusations , I have no more , and I will make none .
No more ? we need no more , sirrah , be drawing their Mittimusbefore we hear their answer. What say you Sir ? are you guilty of thismurther ?
No Sir .
Whether you are or no , confess , it will be the better for you .
If I were guilty , your Rhetorick could not fetch it forth : butthough I am innocent , I confess , that if I were a stander by , thesecirc [ u ] mstances urg 'd , which are true , would make me doubtless believethe accused parties , to be guilty .
Write down , that he being a stander by ; for so you see he is , doth doubtlesly believe the accused parties , which is himself to beguilty .
I say no such thing .
Write it down I say , we 'll try that .
I care not what you write , pray God you did not kill him for mylove , though I am free from this , we both deserve --
Govern your tongue I pray you , all is well , my Husband lives , I know it , and I see him .
They whisper , sever them quickly I say , Officers , why do youlet them prompt one another , Gentlewoman , what say you to this , arenot you guilty ?
No , as I hope for mercy .
But are not those circumstances true , that this Gentleman hathso shortly and methodically deliver 'd ?
They are , and what you do with me , I care not , Since he is dead , in whom was all my care : You knew him not .
No , a n't been better for you too , and you had never known him .
Why then you did not know the worlds chief joy , His face so manly as it had been made , To fright the world , yet he so sweetly temper 'd ; That he would make himself a natural fool , To do a noble kind [ n ] ess for a friend.He was a man whose name I 'll not out-live , Longer than heaven , whose Will must be obey 'd ; Will have me do .
And I will quit thy kindness .
Before me , she has made the tears stand in mine eyes , but Imust be austere , Gentlewoman ; you must confess this murder .
I can not , Sir , I did it not , but I desire to see thoseexaminations which this Gentleman acknowledges to have about him , forbut late last night I receiv 'd Letters from the City , yet I heard ofno confession , then .
You shall see them time enough I warrant you , but Letters yousay you had , where are those Letters ?
Sir , they are gone .
Gone ? whither are they gone ? How have you dispos 'd of 'em ?
Why Sir , they are for womens matters , and so I use 'em .
Who writ 'em ?
A man of mine .
Who brought 'em ?
A Post .
A Post ? there is some great haste sure , aha , where is thatPost ?
Sir , there he stands..
Does he so ? bring hither that Post , I am afraid that Post willprove a knave ; come hither Post , what ? what can you say concerning themurder of Antonio ?
What 's that to you ?
Oh Post , you have no answer ready , have you ? I 'll have onefrom you .
You shall have no more from me than you have ; you examine anhonest Gentleman and Gentlewoman here , 't is pitty such fools as youshould be i'th Commission .
Say you so Post , take away that Post , whip him and bring himagain quickly , I 'll hamper you Post .
'T is Antonio , I know him now as well ; what an irregular foolis this !
Whip me ? hold off .
Oh good Sir whip him , by his murmuring he should knowsomething of my Husbands death ; that may quit me , for gods sakefetch't out .
Whip him I say .
Who is't dares whip me now ?
Oh my lov 'd Husband .
My most worthy friend ? where have you been so long ?
I can not speak for joy .
Why , what 's the matter now , and shall not Law then have hercourse ?
It shall h [ a ] ve no other course than it has I think .
It shall have other course before I go , or I 'll beat mybrains , and I say it was not honestly done of him to discover himselfbefore the parties accus 'd were executed , that Law might have had hercourse , for then the kingdom flourishes .
But such a wife as thou , had never any man , and such a friendas he , believe me wife , shall never be [ a ] good wife , love my friend , friend love my wife , hark friend .
Mark , if we can have nothing to do , you shall swear thepeace of some body .
Yes Sir .
By my troth I am sorry my wife is so obstinate , sooth , if Icould yet do thee any good , I wou 'd , faith I wou 'd .
I thank you Sir , I have lost that passion .
Cosin Curio , you and I must be better acquainted .
It is my wish , Sir .
I should not have known you neither , 't is so long since we saw , we were but children then : but you have shew 'd your self an honest manto me .
I would be ever so .
Richardo and Viola .
Look you , who 's there .
Say nothing to me , for thy peace is made .
Sir , I can nothing say , But that you are her Father , you can bothNot only pardon , when you have a wrong , But love where you have most injury .
I think I shall hear of no hanging this year , there 's A Tinkerand a Whore yet , the Cryer said , that rob 'd her , and are in prison , Ihope they shall be hang 'd .
No truly Sir , they have broke prison .
'T is no matter , then [ t ] he Jaylor shall be hang 'd .
You are deceiv 'd in that too , Sir , 't was known to be againsthis will , and he hath got his pardon , I think for nothing , but if itdoth cost him any thing , I 'll pay it .
Mark , up with your papers , away .
Oh you shall stay dinner , I have a couple of brawlingneighbors , that I 'll assure you will not agree , and you shall havethe hearing of their matter .
With all my heart .
Go , Gentlemen , go in .

Well bred , Sir , I do deliver that upon my credit , And of an honest stock .
It seems so , Captain , And no doubt will do well .

And why your valiant Father , our great General , The hand that taught to strike , the Love that led all ; Why he , that was the Father of the War , He that begot , and bred the Souldier , Why he sits shaking of his Arms , like Autumn , His Colours folded , and his Drums cas 'd up , The tongue of War for ever ty 'd within us ?
It must be so : Captain you are a stranger , But of a small time here a Souldier , Yet that time shews ye a right good , and great one , Else I could tell ye hours are strangely alter 'd : The young Duke has too many eyes upon him , Too many fears 't is thought too , and to nourish those , Maintains too many Instruments .
Turn their hearts , Or turn their heels up , Heaven : 'T is strange it should be : The old Duke lov 'd him dearly .
He deserv 'd it ; And were he not my Father , I durst tell ye , The memorable hazards he has run throughDeserv 'd of this man too ; highly deserv 'd too ; Had they been less , they had been safe Putskie , And sooner reach 'd regard .
There you struck sure , Sir .
Did I never tell thee of a vow he madeSome years before the old Duke dyed ?
I have heard yeSpeak often of that vow ; but how it was , Or to what end , I never understood yet .
I find a fear too , which begins to tell me , The Duke will have but poor and slight defences , If his hot humour raign , and not his honour : How stand you with him , Sir ?
A perdue Captain , Full of my Fathers danger .
He has rais 'd a young man , They say a slight young man , I know him not , For what desert ?
Believe it , a brave Gentleman , Worth the Dukes respect , a clear sweet Gentleman , And of a noble soul : Come let 's retire us , And wait upon my Father , who within this hourYou will find an alter 'd man .
I am sorry for't , Sir. [ Exeunt.SCENE II .
Olympia , and two Gentlewomen .
Is't not a handsome Wench ?
She is well enough , Madam : I have seen a better face , and a straighter body , And yet she is a pretty Gentlewoman .
What thinkst thou Petesca ?
Alas , Madam , I have no skill , she has a black eye , Which is of the least too , and the dullest water : And when her mouth was made , for certain Madam , Nature intended her a right good stomach .
She has a good hand .
'T is good enough to hold fast , And strong enough to strangle the neck of a Lute .
What think ye of her colour ?
If it be her own'Tis good black blood : right weather-proofI warrant it .
What a strange pace she has got !
That 's but her breeding .
And what a manly body ! me thinks she looksAs though she would pitch the Bar , or go to Buffets .
Yet her behaviour 's utterly against it , For me thinks she is too bashful .
Is that hurtful ?
Even equal to too bold : either of 'em , Madam , May do her injury when time shall serve her .
You discourse learnedly , call in the wench. [ Ex. Gent.What envious fools are you ? Is the rule general , That Women can speak handsomly of none , But those they are bred withal ?
Scarce well of those , Madam , If they believe they may out-shine 'em any way : Our natures are like Oyl , compound us with any thing , Yet still we strive to swim o ' th ' top : Suppose there were here now , Now in this Court of Mosco , a stranger Princess , Of bloud and beauty equal to your excellence , As many eyes and services stuck on her ; What would you think ?
I would think she might deserve it .
Your Grace shall give me leave not to believe ye ; I know you are a Woman , and so humour 'd : I'le tell ye Madam , I could then get more Gowns on ye , More Caps and Feathers , more Scarfs , and more Silk-stockingsWith rocking you asleep with nightly railingsUpon that Woman , than if I had nine livesI could wear out : by this hand ye'would scratch her eyes out .
Thou art deceiv 'd fool ; Now let your own eye mock ye .
Alinda.Come hither Girl : hang me and she be not a handsom one .
I fear it will prove indeed so .
Did you ever serve yetIn any place of worth ?
No , Royal Lady .
Hold up your head ; fie .
Let her alone , stand from her .
It shall be now , Of all the blessings my poor youth has pray 'd for , The greatest and the happiest to serve you ; And might my promise carry but that creditTo be believ 'd , because I am yet a stranger , Excellent Lady , when I fall from duty , From all the service that my life can lend me , May everlasting misery then find me .
What think ye now ? I do believe , and thank ye ; And sure I shall not be so far forgetful , To see that honest faith die unrewarded : What must I call your name ?
Alinda , Madam .
Can ye sing ?
A little , when my grief will give me leave , Lady .
What grief canst thou have Wench ? Thou art not in love ?
If I be Madam , 't is only with your goodness ; For yet I never saw that man I sighed for .
Of what years are you ?
My Mother oft has told me , That very day and hour this land was blestWith your most happy birth , I first salutedThis worlds fair light : Nature was then so busie , And all the Graces to adorn your goodness , I stole into the world poor and neglected .
Something there was , when I first look 'd upon thee , Made me both like and love thee : now I know it ; And you shall find that knowledge shall not hurt you : I hope ye are a Maid ?
I hope so too , Madam ; I am sure for any man : and were I otherwise , Of all the services my hopes could point at , I durst not touch at yours .
, Burris , and Gent .
The great Duke , Madam .
Good morrow , Sister .
A good day to your highness .
I am come to pray you use no more perswasionsFor this old stubborn man : nay to command ye : His sail is swell 'd too full : he is grown too insolent , Too self-affected , proud : those poor slight servicesHe has done my Father , and my self , has blown himTo such a pitch , he flyes to stoop our favours .
I am sorry Sir : I ever thought those servicesBoth great and noble .
However , may it please yeBut to consider 'em a true hearts Servants , Done out of faith to you , and not self-fame : Do but consider royal Sir , the dangers ; When you have slept secure , the mid-night tempests , That as he marcht sung through his aged locks ; When you have fed at full , the wants and famins ; The fires of Heaven , when you have found all temperate , Death with his thousand doors --
I have consider 'd ; No more : and that I will have , shall be .
For the best , I hope all still .
What handsom wench is that there ?
My Servant , Sir .
Prethee observe her Burris , Is she not wondrous handsom ? speak thy freedom .
She appears no less to me Sir .
Of whence is she ?
Her Father I am told is a good Gentleman , But far off dwelling : her desire to serve meBrought her to th ' Court , and here her friends have left her .
She may find better friends : Ye are welcom fair one , I have not seen a sweeter : By your Ladies leave : Nay stand up sweet , we 'll have no superstition : You have got a Servant ; you may use him kindly , And he may honour ye : [ Ex. Duke and Burris.Good morrow Sister .
Good morrow to your Grace. How the wench blushes ! How like an A [ n ] gel now she looks !
At first jumpJump into the Dukes arms ? we must look to you , Indeed we must , the next jump we are journeymen .
I see the ruine of our hopes already , Would she were at home again , milking her Fathers Cows .
I fear she'l milk all the great Courtiers first .
This has not made ye proud ?
No certain , Madam .
It was the Duke that kist ye .
'T was your Brother , And therefore nothing can be meant but honour .
But say he love ye ?
That he may with safety : A Princes love extends to all his subjects .
But say in more particular ?
Pray fear not : For vertues sake deliver me from doubts , Lady : 'T is not the name of King , nor all his promises , His glories , and his greatness stuck about me , Can make me prove a Traitor to your service : You are my Mistris , and my noble Master , Your vertues my ambition , and your favourThe end of all my love , and all my fortune : And when I fail in that faith --
I believe thee , Come wipe your eyes ; I do : take you example --
I would her eyes were out .
If the wind stand in this door , We shall have but cold custome : some trick or other , And speedily .
Let me alone to think o n't .
Come , be you near me still .
With all my duty. [ Exeunt.SCENA III .
Archas , Theodor , Putskie , Ancient , and Souldiers , carrying his armour piece-meale , his Colours wound up , and his Drums in Cases .
This is the heaviest march we e 're trod Captain .
This was not wont to be : these honour 'd piecesThe fierie god of war himself would smile at , Buckl 'd upon that body , were not wont thus , Like Reliques to be offer 'd to long rust , And heavy-ey 'd oblivion brood upon 'em .
Ye are indeed to us Sir .
Dead to our fortunes , General .
You'l find a better , A greater , and a stronger man to lead ye , And to a stronger fortune : I am old , friends , Time , and the wars together make me stoop , Gentle [ men ] , Stoop to my grave : my mind unfurnish 'd too , Emptie and weak as I am : my poor body , Able for nothing now but contemplation , And that will be a task too to a Souldier : Yet had they but encourag 'd me , or thought wellOf what I have done , I think I should have ventur'dFor one knock more , I should have made a shift yetTo have broke one staff more handsomly , and have diedLike a good fellow , and an honest Souldier , In the head of ye all , with my Sword in my hand , And so have made an end of all with credit .
Well , there will come an hour , when all these injuries , These secure slights --
Ha ! no more of that sirrah , Not one word more of that I charge ye .
I must speak Sir.And may that tongue forget to sound your service , That 's dumb to your abuses .
Understand fool , That voluntary I sit down .
You are forced , Sir , Forced for your safety : I too well rememberThe time and cause , and I may live to curse 'em : You made this Vow , and whose unnobleness , Indeed forgetfulness of good --
No more , As thou art mine no more .
Whose doubts and envies -- But the Devil will have his due .
Good gentle Colonel .
And though disgraces , and contempt of HonourReign now , the Wheel must turn again .
Peace Sirrah , Your tongue 's too saucy : do you stare upon me ? Down with that heart , down suddenly , down with it , Down with that disobedience ; tye that tongue up .
Tongue ?
Do not provoke me to forget my Vow , Sirrah.And draw that fatal Sword again in anger .
For Heavens sake , Colonel .
Do not let me doubtWhose Son thou art , because thou canst not suffer : Do not play with mine anger ; if thou dost , By all the Loyalty my heart holds --
I have done , Sir , Pray pardon me .
I pray be worthy of it : Beshrew your heart , you have vext me .
I am sorry , Sir .
Go to , no more of this : be true and honest , I know ye are man enough , mould it to just ends , And let not my disgraces , then I am miserable , When I have nothing left me but thy angers .
, Burris , Boroskie , Attend. and Gent .
And't please ye , Sir , the Duke .
Now , what 's all this ? The meaning of this ceremonious Emblem ?
Your Grace should first remember --
There 's his Nature .
I do , and shall remember still that injury , That at the Muster , where it pleas 'd your GreatnessTo laugh at my poor Souldiership , to scorn it ; And more to make me seem ridiculous , Took from my hands my charge .
O think not so , Sir .
And in my Fathers sight .
Heaven be my witness , I did no more , ( and that with modesty , With Love and Faith to you ) than was my warrant , And from your Father seal 'd : nor durst that rudeness , And impudence of scorn fall from my 'haviour , I ever yet knew duty .
We shall teach ye , I well remember too , upon some words I told ye , Then at that time , some angry words ye answer 'd , If ever I were Duke , you were no Souldier.You have kept your word , and so it shall be to you , From henceforth I dismiss you ; take your ease , Sir .
I humbly thank your Grace ; this wasted Body , Beaten and bruis 'd with Arms , dry 'd up with troubles , Is good for nothing else but quiet , now Sir , And holy Prayers ; in which , when I forgetTo thank Heaven for all your bounteous favours , May that be deaf , and my Petitions perish .
What a smooth humble Cloak he has cas 'd his pride in ! And how he has pull 'd his Claws in ! there 's no trusting --
Speak for the best .
Believe I shall do ever .
To make ye understand , we feel not yetSuch dearth of Valour , and Experience , Such a declining Age of doing Spirits , That all should be confin 'd within your excellence , And you , or none be honour 'd , take Boroskie , The place he has commanded , lead the Souldier ; A little time will bring thee to his honour , Which has been nothing but the Worlds opinion , The Souldiers fondness , and a little fortune , Which I believe his Sword had the least share in .
O that I durst but answer now .
Good Colonel .
My heart will break else : Royal Sir , I know notWhat you esteem mens lives , whose hourly labours , And loss of Blood , consumptions in your service , Whose Bodies are acquainted with more miseries , And all to keep you safe , than Dogs or Slaves are.His Sword the least share gain 'd ?
You will not fight with me ?
No Sir , I dare not , You are my Prince , but I dare speak to ye , And dare speak truth , which none of their ambitionsThat be informers to you , dare once think of ; Yet truth will now but anger ye ; I am sorry for't , And so I take my leave. [ Exit .
Ev'n when you please , Sir .
Sirrah , see me no more .
And so may you too : You have a house i'th ' Country , keep you there , Sir , And when you have rul 'd your self , teach your Son manners , For this time I forgive him .
Heaven forgive all ; And to your Grace a happy and long Rule here.And you Lord General , may your fights be prosperous.In all your Course may Fame and Fortune court you.Fight for your Country , and your Princes safety ; Boldly , and bravely face your Enemy , And when you strike , strike with that killing Vertue , As if a general Plague had seiz 'd before ye ; Danger , and doubt , and labour cast behind ye ; And then come home an old and noble Story .
A little comfort , Sir .
As little as may be : Farewel , you know your limit. [ Ex. Duke , & c .
Alas , brave Gentleman .
I do , and will observe it suddenly , My Grave ; I , that 's my limit ; 't is no new thing , Nor that can make me start , or tremble at it , To buckle with that old grim Souldier now : I have seen him in his sowrest shapes , and dreadfull'st ; I , and I thank my honesty , have stood him : That audit 's cast ; farewel my honest Souldiers , Give me your hands ; farewel , farewel good Ancient , A stout man , and a true , thou art come in sorrow.Blessings upon your Swords , may they ne'r fail ye ; You do but change a man ; your fortune 's constant ; That by your ancient Valours is ty 'd fast still ; Be valiant still , and good : and when ye fight next , When flame and fury make but one face of horrour , When the great rest of all your honour 's up , When you would think a Spell to shake the enemy , Remember me , my Prayers shall be with ye : So once again farewel .
Let 's wait upon ye .
No , no , it must not be ; I have now left meA single Fortune to my self , no more , Which needs no train , nor complement ; good Captain , You are an honest and a sober Gentleman , And one I think has lov 'd me .
I am sure o n't .
Look to my Boy , he 's grown too headstrong for me.And if they think him fit to carry Arms still , His life is theirs ; I have a house i'th ' Country , And when your better hours will give you liberty , See me : you shall be welcome. Fortune to ye. [ Exit .
I 'll cry no more , that will do him no good , And 'twill but make me dry , and I have no money : I 'll fight no more , and that will do them harm ; And if I can do that , I care not for money : I could have curst reasonable well , and I have had the luck tooTo have 'em hit sometimes. Whosoever thou art , That like a Devil didst possess the DukeWith these malicious thoughts ; mark what I say to thee , A Plague upon thee , that 's but the Preamble .
O take the Pox too .
They 'll cure one another ; I must have none but kills , and those kill stinking : Or look ye , let the single Pox possess them , Or Pox upon Pox .
That 's but ill i'th ' arms , Sir .
'T is worse i'th ' Legs , I would not wish it else : And may those grow to scabs as big as Mole-hills , And twice a day , the Devil with a Curry-CombScratch 'em , and scrub 'em : I warrant him he has 'em .
May he be ever lowzie .
That 's a pleasure , The Beggar 's Lechery ; sometimes the Souldiers : May he be ever lazie , stink where he stands , And Maggots breed in 's Brains .
I , marry Sir , May he fall mad in love with his Grand-mother , And kissing her , may her teeth drop into his mouth , And one fall cross his throat , then let him gargle .
Now , what 's the matter ?
Where 's the Duke , pray , Gentlemen ?
Keep on your way , you can not miss .
I thank ye. [ Exit .
If he be married , may he dream he 's cuckol 'd , And when he wakes believe , and swear he saw it , Sue a Divorce , and after find her honest : Then in a pleasant Pigstye , with his own garters , And a fine running knot , ride to the Devil .
If these would do --
I 'll never trust my mind more , If all these fail .
What shall we do now , Captain ? For by this honest hand I 'll be torn in pieces , Unless my old General go , or some that love him , And love us equal too , before I fight more : I can make a Shooe yet , and draw it on too , If I like the Leg well .
Fight ? 't is likely : No , there will be the sport Boys , when there 's need on's.They think the other Crown will do , will carry us , And the brave golden Coat of Captain CankroBoroskie. What a noise his very name carries ! 'T is Gun enough to fright a Nation , He needs no Souldiers ; if he do , for my part , I promise ye he 's like to seek 'em ; so I think you think too , And all the Army ; No , honest , brave old Archas , We can not so soon leave thy memory , So soon forget thy goodness : he that does , The scandal and the scumm of Arms be counted .
You much rejoice me now you have hit my meaning , I durst not press ye , till I found your spirits : Continue thus .
I 'll go and tell the Duke o n't .
No , no , he 'll find it soon enough , and fear it , When once occasion comes : Another Packet ! From whence , Friend , come you ?
From the Borders , Sir .
What news , Sir , I beseech you ?
Fire and Sword , Gentlemen ; The Tartar 's up , and with a mighty force , Comes forward , like a tempest , all before himBurning and killing .
Brave Boys , brave news , Boys .
Either we must have present help --
Still braver .
Where lies the Duke ?
He 's there .
'Save ye , Gentlemen. [ Exit .
We are safe enough , I warrant thee : Now the time 's come .
I , now 't is come indeed , and now stand firm , Boys , And let 'em burn on merrily .
This City would make a fine marvellous Bone-fire : 'T is old dry timber , and such Wood has no fellow .
Here will be trim piping anon and whining , Like so many Pigs in a storm , When they hear the news once .
Boroskie , and Servant .
Here 's one has heard it already ; Room for the General .
Say I am faln exceeding sick o'th ' sudden , And am not like to live .
If ye go on , Sir , For they will kill ye certainly ; they look for ye .

Olympia .
O my good Wench , what shall become of us ? The Posts come hourly in , and bring new danger ; The enemy is past the Volga , and bears hitherWith all the blood and cruelty he carries , My Brother now will find his fault .
I doubt me , Somewhat too late , Madam. But pray fear not , All will be well , I hope. Sweet Madam , shake not .
How cam'st thou by this Spirit ? our Sex trembles .
I am not unacquainted with these dangers ; And you shall know my truth ; for ere you perish , A hundred Swords shall pass through me : 't is but dying , And Madam we must do it : the manner 's all : You have a Princely Birth , take Princely thoughts to you , And take my counsel too ; go presently , With all the haste ye have , ( I will attend ye ) With all the possible speed , to old Lord Archas , He honours ye ; with all your art perswade him , ( 'Twill be a dismal time else ) woo him hither , But hither Madam , make him see the danger ; For your new General looks like an Ass ; There 's nothing in his face but loss .
I 'll do it.And thank thee , sweet Alinda : O my Jewel , How much I 'm bound to love thee ! by this hand , Wench , If thou wert a man --
I would I were to fight for you.But haste dear Madam .
I need no Spurs Alinda.SCENE V .
The Lord General sick now ? is this a timeFor men to creep into their Beds ? What 's become , Post , Of my Lieutenant ?
Beaten , and't please your Grace , And all his Forces sparkled .
That 's but cold news : How now , what good news ? are the Souldiers ready ?
Yes Sir , but fight they will not , nor stir from that placeThey stand in now , unless they have Lord ArchasTo lead 'em out ; they rail upon this General , And sing Songs of him , scurvy Songs , to worse tunes : And much they spare not you , Sir : here they swearThey 'll stand and see the City burnt , and dance about it , Unless Lord Archas come before they fight for't : It must be so , Sir .
I could wish it so too ; And to that end I have sent Lord Burris to him ; But all I fear will fail ; we must dye , Gentlemen , And one stroke we 'll have for't .
Burris.What bring'st thou , Burris ?
That I am loth to tell ; he will not come , Sir ; I found him at his Prayers , there he tells me , The Enemy shall take him , fit for Heaven : I urg 'd to him all our dangers , his own worths , The Countries ruine ; nay I kneel 'd and pray 'd him ; He shook his head , let fall a tear , and pointedThus with his finger to the Ground ; a GraveI think he meant ; and this was all he answer'd.Your Grace was much to blame : Where 's the new General ?
He is sick , poor man .
He 's a poor man indeed , Sir : Your Grace must needs go to the Souldier .
They have sent me wordThey will not stir , they rail at me , And all the spight they have -- [ Shout within.What shout is that there ? Is the Enemy come so near ?
Archas , Olympia , and Alinda .
I have brought him , Sir , At length I have woo 'd him thus far .
Happy Sister , O blessed Woman !
Use him nobly , Brother ; You never had more need : And Gentlemen , All the best powers ye have , to tongues turn presently , To winning and perswading tongues : all my art , Only to bring him hither , I have utter 'd ; Let it be yours to arm him ; And good my Lord , Though I exceed the limit you allow 'd me , Which was the happiness to bring ye hither , And not to urge ye farther ; yet , see your Country , Out of your own sweet Spirit now behold it : Turn round , and look upon the miseries , On every side the fears ; O see the dangers ; We find 'em soonest , therefore hear me first , Sir .
Next hear your Prince : You have said you lov 'd him , Archas , And thought your life too little for his service ; Think not your vow too great now , now the time is , And now you are brought to th ' test , touch right now Souldier , Now shew the manly pureness of thy mettle ; Now if thou beest that valued man , that vertue , That great obedience teaching all , now stand it.What I have said forget , my youth was hasty , And what you said your self forgive , you were angry.If men could live without their faults , they were gods , Archas.He weeps , and holds his hands up : to him , Burris .
You have shew 'd the Prince his faults ; And like a good Surgeon you have laidThat to 'em makes 'em smart ; he feels it , Let 'em not fester now , Sir ; your own honour , The bounty of that mind , and your allegiance , 'Gainst which I take it , Heaven gives no Command , Sir , Nor seals no Vow , can better teach ye nowWhat ye have to do , than I , or this necessity ; Only this little 's left ; would ye do nobly , And in the Eye of Honour truly triumph ? Conquer that mind first , and then men are nothing .
Last , a poor Virgin kneels ; for loves sake General , If ever you have lov 'd ; for her sake , Sir , For your own honesty , which is a Virgin , Look up , and pity us , be bold and fortunate , You are a Knight , a good and noble Souldier , And when your Spurs were given ye , your Sword buckl 'd , Then were you sworn for Vertues Cause , for Beauties , For Chastity to strike ; strike now , they suffer ; Now draw your Sword , or else you are recreant , Only a Knight i'th ' Heels , i'th ' Heart a Coward ; Your first Vow honour made , your last but anger .
How like my vertuous Wife this thing looks , speaks too ? So would she chide my dulness : fair one , I thank ye.My gracious Sir , your pardon , next your hand : Madam , your favour , and your prayers : Gentlemen , Your wishes , and your loves : and pretty sweet one , A favour for your Souldier .
Give him this , Wench .
Thus do I tye on Victory .
My Armour , My Horse , my Sword , my tough Staff , and my Fortune , And Olin now I come to shake thy glory .
Go , brave and prosperous , our loves go with thee .
Full of thy vertue , and our Prayers attend thee .

No news of Archas yet ?
But now , and't please ye , A Post came in , Letters he brought none with him , But this deliver 'd : He saw the Armies join , The game of Blood begun , and by our General , Who never was acquainted but with Conquest , So bravely fought , he saw the Tartars shaken , And there he said he left 'em .
Where 's Boroskie ?
He 's up again , and't please ye .
Sir , methinksThis News should make ye lightsome , bring joy to ye , It strikes our hearts with general Comfort. [ Exit Duke.Gone ? What should this mean , so suddenly ? He 's well ?
We see no other .
Would the rest were well too , That put these starts into him .
I 'll go after him .
'Twill not be fit , Sir : h'as some secret in himHe would not be disturb 'd in : know you any thingHas crost him since the General went ?
Not any : If there had been , I am sure I should have found it : Only I have heard him oft complain for money : Money he says he wants .
It may be that then .
To him that has so ma [ n ] y wayes to raise it , And those so honest , it can not be .
Boroskie .
He comes back , And Lord Boroskie with him .
There the game goes , I fear some new thing hatching .
Come hither Burris.Go see my Sister , and commend me to her , And to my little Mistriss give this Token ; Tell her I'le see her shortly .
Yes , I shall , Sir. [ Ex. Bur. and Gent .
Wait you without : I would yet try him further .
'Twill not be much amiss : has your Grace heard yetOf what he has done i'th ' Field ?
A Post but nowCame in , who saw 'em joyn , and has delivered , The Enemy gave ground before he parted .
'T is well .
Come , speak thy mind man : 't is not for fighting , A noise of War , I keep thee in my bosom ; Thy ends are nearer to me ; from my ChildhoodThou brought'st me up : and like another nature , Made good all my necessities : speak boldly .
Sir , what I utter , will be thought but envyThough I intend , high heaven knows , but your honour , When vain and empty people shall proclaim me -- Good Sir excuse me .
Do you fear me for your Enemy ? Speak on your duty .
Then I must , and dare , Sir : When he comes home , take heed the Court receive him not , Take heed he meet not with their loves and praises , That Glass will shew him ten times greater , Sir , ( And make him strive to make good that proportion , ) Than ere his fortune bred him , he is honourable , At least I strive to understand him so , And of a nature , if not this way poyson 'd , Perfect enough , easie , and sweet , but those are soon seduc 'd , Sir ; He 's a great man , and what that Pill may work , Prepar 'd by general voices of the people , Is the end of all my Counsel , only this , Sir , Let him retire a while , there 's more hangs by itThan you know yet : there if he stand a while well , But till the Souldier cool , whom , for their serviceYou must pay now most liberally , most freely , And showre your self into 'em ; 't is the bountyThey follow with their loves , and not the bravery .
But where 's the Money ? how now ?
Sir , the Colonel , Son to the Lord Archas , with most happy newsOf the Tartars overthrow , without hereAttends your Graces pleasure .
Be not seen , Sir , He 's a bold fellow , let me stand his Thunders , To th ' Court he must not come : no blessing here , Sir , No face of favour , if you love your honour .

How many men have ye lost ?
Do 's he lye this way ?
I am sure you fought it bravely .
I must see him .
You can not yet , ye must not , what 's your Commission ?
No Gentleman o'th ' Chamber here ?
Why , pray ye , Sir ? Am not I fit to entertain your business ?
I think you are not , Sir ; I am sure ye shall not.I bring no tales , nor flatteries : in my tongue , Sir , I carry no fork 'd stings .

And were they thus deliver 'd ye ?
My Lord , I am no pen-man , nor no Orator , My tongue was never Oyl 'd with Here and't like ye , There I beseech ye , weigh , I am a Souldier , And truth I covet only , no fine terms , Sir ; I come not to stand treating here ; my businessIs with the Duke , and of such general blessing --
You have overthrown the enemy , we know it , And we rejoyce i n't ; ye have done like honest Subjects , You have done handsomely and well .
But well , Sir ? But handsomely and well ? what are we juglers ? I'le do all that in cutting up a Capon.But handsomely and well ? does your Lordship take usFor the Dukes Tumblers ? we have done bravely , Sir , Ventur 'd our lives like men .
Then bravely be it .
And for as brave rewards we look , and graces , We have sweat and bled for't , Sir .
And ye may have it , If you will stay the giving. Men that thank themselves firstFor any good they do , take off the lustre , And blot the benefit .
Are these the welcomes , The Bells that ring out our rewards ? pray heartily , Early and late , there may be no more Enemies : Do my good Lord , pray seriously , and sigh too , For if there be --
They must be met , and fought with .
By whom ? by you ? they must be met and flatter'd.Why , what a Devil ail 'd ye to do these things ? With what assurance dare ye mock men thus ? You have but single lives , and those I take itA Sword may find too : why do ye dam the Duke up ? And choak that course of love , that like a RiverShould fill our empty veins again with comforts ? But if ye use these knick knacks , This fast and loose , with faithful men and honest , You'l be the first will find it .
Archas , Souldiers , Putskey , Ancient , and others .
You are too untemperate .
Better be so , and thief too , than unthankful : Pray use this old man so , and then we are paid all.The Duke thanks ye for your service , and the Court thanks ye , And wonderful desirous they are to see ye ; Pray Heaven we have room enough to march for May-games , Pageants , and Bone-fires for your welcome home , Sir.Here your most noble friend the Lord Boroskie , A Gentleman too tender of your credit , And ever in the Dukes ear , for your good , Sir , Crazie and sickly , yet to be your servant , Has leapt into the open air to meet ye .
The best is , your words wound not , you are welcome home , Sir ; Heartily welcome home , and for your service , The noble overthrow you gave the Enemy , The Duke salutes ye too with all his thanks , Sir .
Sure they will now regard us .
There 's a reason : But by the changing of the Colonels countenance , The rolling of his eyes like angry Billows ; I fear the wind 's not down yet , Ancient .
Is the Duke well , Sir ?
Not much unhealthy , Only a little grudging of an Ague , Which can not last : he has heard , which makes him fearful , And loth as yet to give your worth due welcome , The sickness hath been somewhat hot i'th ' Army , Which happily may prove more doubt than danger , And more his fear than fate ; yet howsoever , An honest care --
Ye say right , and it shall be ; For though upon my life 't is but a rumor , A meer opinion , without faith or fear i n't ; For Sir , I thank Heaven , we never stood more healthy , Never more high and lusty ; yet to satisfie , We can not be too curious , or too carefulOf what concerns his state , we 'll draw away , Sir , And lodge at further distance , and less danger .
It will be well .
It will be very scurvy : I smell it out , it stinks abominably , Stir it no more .
The Duke , Sir , would have you too , For a short day or two , retire to your own house , Whither himself will come to visit ye , And give ye thanks .
I shall attend his pleasure .
A trick , a lousie trick : so ho , a trick Boys .
How now , what 's that ?
I thought I had found a Hare , Sir , But 't is a Fox , an old Fox , shall we hunt him ?
No more such words .
The Souldier 's grown too sawcy , You must tie him straiter up .
I do my best , Sir ; But men of free-born minds sometimes will flie out .
May not we see the Duke ?
Not at this time , Gentlemen , Your General knows the cause .
We have no Plague , Sir , Unless it be in our pay , nor no Pox neither ; Or if we had , I hope that good old CourtierWill not deny us place there .
Certain my Lord , Considering what we are , and what we have done ; If not , what need ye may have , 'twould be better , A great deal nobler , and taste honesterTo use us with more sweetness ; men that digAnd lash away their lives at the Carts tail , Double our comforts ; meat , and their Masters thanks too , When they work well , they have ; Men of our quality , When they do well , and venture for't with valour , Fight hard , lye hard , feed hard , when they come home , Sir , And know these are deserving things , things worthy , Can you then blame 'em if their minds a littleBe stir 'd with glory ? 't is a pride becomes 'em , A little season 'd with ambition , To be respected , reckon 'd well , and honour'dFor what they have done : when to come home thus poorly , And met with such unjointed joy , so looked on , As if we had done no more but drest a Horse well ; So entertain 'd , as if , I thank ye Gentlemen , Take that to drink , had pow'r to please a Souldier ? Where be the shouts , the Bells rung out , the people ? The Prince himself ?
They shall be immediately ; I stay for money ; And any favour else --
We are all bound to ye ; And so I take my leave , Sir ; when the Duke pleasesTo make me worthy of his eyes --
Which will be suddenly , I know his good thoughts to ye .
With all duty , And all humility , I shall attend , Sir .
Once more you are welcome home : these shall be satisfied .
Be sure we be : and handsomly .
Wait you on me , Sir .
And honestly : no jugling .
Will ye come , Sir ? [ Exit .
Pray do not doubt .
We are no Boys. [ Exit .
Well Sir .
Here 's mony from the Duke , and't please your Lordship .
'T is well .
How sowre the Souldiers look ?
Is't told ?
Yes , and for every company a double pay , And the Dukes love to all .
That 's worth a Ducket .
You that be Officers , see it discharg 'd then , Why do not you take it up ?
'T is too heavy : 'Body o'me , I have strain 'd mine arm .
Do ye scorn it ?
Has your Lor [ d ] ship any dice about ye ? sit round Gentlemen , And come on seven for my share .
Do you think Sir , This is the end we fight ? can this durt draw usTo such a stupid tameness , that our serviceNeglected , and look 'd lamely on , and skew 'd atWith a few honourable words , and this , is righted ? Have not we eyes and ears , to hear and see Sir , And minds to understand the slights we carry ? I come home old , and full of hurts , men look on meAs if I had got 'em from a whore , and shun me ; I tell my griefs , and fear my wants , I am answer 'd , Alas 't is pity ! pray dine with me on Sunday : These are the sores we are sick of , the minds maladies , And can this cure 'em ? you should have us 'd us nobly , And for our doing well , as well proclaim 'd usTo the worlds eye , have shew 'd and sainted us , Then ye had paid us bravely : then we had shin 'd Sir , Not in this gilded stuff but in our glory : You may take back your mony .
This I fear 'd still .
Consider better Gentlemen .
Thank your Lordship : And now I'le put on my considering cap : My Lord , that I am no Courtier , you may guess itBy having no sute to you for this mony : For though I want , I want not this , nor shall not , Whilst you want that civility to rank itWith those rights we expected ; mony grows Sir , And men must gather it , all is not put in one purse.And that I am no Carter , I could never whistle yet : But that I am a Souldier , and a Gentleman , And a fine Gentleman , and't like your honour , And a most pleasant companion : all you that are witty , Come list to my ditty : come set in boyes , With your Lordships patience. [ Song.How do you like my Song , my Lord ?
Even as I like your self , but 'twould be a great deal better , You would prove a great deal wiser , and take this mony , In your own phrase I speak now Sir , and 't is very wellYou have learn 'd to sing ; for since you prove so liberal , To refuse such means as this , maintain your voice still , 'Twill prove your best friend .
'T is a singing age Sir , A merry moon here now : I'le follow it : Fidling , and fooling now , gains more than fighting .
What is't you blench at ? what would you ask ? speak freely .
And so we dare : a triumph for the General,
And then an honour special to his vertue .
That we may be prefer 'd that have serv 'd for it , And cram 'd up into favour like the worshipful , At least upon the Cities charge made drunkFor one whole year ; we have done 'em ten years service ; That we may enjoy our lechery without grudging , And mine , or thine be nothing , all things equal , And catch as catch may , be proclaim 'd : that when we borrow , And have no will to pay again , no LawLay hold upon us , nor no Court controule us .
Some of these may come to pass ; the Duke may do 'em , And no doubt will : the General will find too , And so will you , if you but stay with patience : I have no power .
Nor will : come fellow Souldiers .
Pray be not so distrustfull .
There are waies yet , And honest waies ; we are not brought up Statues .
If your LordshipHave any silk stockings , that have holes i'th ' heels , Or ever an honourable Cassock that wants buttons , I could have cur 'd such maladies : your Lordships customeAnd my good Ladies , if the bones want settingIn her old bodies --
This is disobedience .
Eight pence a day , and hard Eggs .
Troop off Gentlemen , Some Coin we have , whilst this lasts , or our credits , We'l never sell our Generals worth for six-pence.Ye are beholding to us .
Fare ye well Sir , And buy a pipe with that : do ye see this skarf Sir ? By this hand I'le cry Brooms i n't , birchen Brooms Sir , Before I eat one bit from your benevolence.Now to our old occupations again.By your leave Lord. [ Exeunt .
You will bite when ye are sharper ; take up the mony.This love I must remove , this fondness to him , This tenderness of heart ; I have lost my way else.There is no sending man , they will not take it , They are yet too full of pillage , They'l dance for't ere't be long : Come , bring it after .
Duke .
How now , refus 'd their mony ?
Very bravely , And stand upon such terms 't is terrible .
Where 's Archas ?
He 's retir 'd Sir , to his house , According to your pleasure , full of dutieTo outward shew : but what within --
Refuse it ?
Most confidently : 't is not your revenuesCan feed the [ m ] Sir , and yet they have found a GeneralThat knows no ebbe of bountie : there they eat Sir , And loath your invitations .
'T is not possible , He 's poor as they .
You'l find it otherwise.Pray make your journey thither presently , And as ye goe I'le open ye a wonder.Good Sir this morning .
Follow me , I'le doe it. [ Exeunt.SCENA II .
Olympia , Alinda , Burris , and Gentlewomen .
But do you think my Brother loves her ?
Certain Madam , He speaks much of her , and sometimes with wonder , Oft wishes she were nobler born .
Do you think him honest ?
Your Grace is nearer to his heart , than I am , Upon my life I hold him so .
'T is a poor wench , I would not have her wrong 'd : methinks my Brother -- But I must not give rules to his affections ; Yet if he weigh her worth --
You need not fear Madam .
I hope I shall not : Lord BurrisI love her well ; I know not , there is somethingMakes me bestow more than a care upon her : I do not like that ring from him to her ; I mean to women of her way , such tokensRather appear as baits , than royal bounties : I would not have it so .
You will not find it , Upon my troth I think his most ambitionIs but to let the world know h'as a handsom Mistris : Will your grace command me any service to him ?
Remember all my duty .
Blessings crown ye : What 's your will Lady ?
Any thing that 's honest ; And if you think it fit , so poor a service , Clad in a ragged vertue , may reach him , I do beseech your Lordship speak it humbly .
Fair one I will : in the best phrase I have too , And so I kiss your hand. [ Exit .
Your Lordships Servant .
Come hither wench , what art thou doing with that Ring ?
I am looking on the posie , Madam .
What is't ?
The Jewel 's set within .
But where the joy wench , When that invisible Jewel 's lost ? why dost thou smile so ? What unhappy meaning hast thou ?
Nothing Madam , But only thinking what strange spells these Rings have , And how they work with some .
I fear with you too .
This could not cost above a Crown .
'Twill cost youThe shaving of your crown , if not the washing .
But he that sent it , makes the vertue greater ;
I and the vice too Madam : goodness bless me : How fit 't is for my finger !
No doubt you'l find tooA finger fit for you .
Sirrah , Petesca , What wilt thou give me for the good that follows this ? But thou hast Rings enough , thou art provided : Heigh ho , what must I doe now ?
You'l be taught that , The easiest part that e 're you lear n't , I warrant you .
Ay me , ay me .
You will divide too , shortly , Your voice comes finely forward .
Come hither wanton , Thou art not surely as thou saist .
I would not : But sure there is a witchcraft in this Ring , Lady , Lord how my heart leaps !
'Twill goe pit a pat shortly .
And now methinks a thousand of the Dukes shapes .
Will no less serve ye ?
In ten thousand smiles .
Heaven bless the wench .
With eyes that will not be deni 'd to enter ; And such soft sweet embraces ; take it from me , I am undone else Madam : I 'm lost else .
What ailes the girle ?
How suddenly I 'm alter 'd ! And grown my self again ! do not you feel it ?
Wear that , and I'le wear this : I'le try the strength o n't .
How cold my bloud grows now ! Here 's sacred vertue : When I leave to honour this , Every hour to pay a kiss , When each morning I arise , Or I forget a sacrifice : When this figure in my faith , And the pureness that it hath , I pursue not with my will , Nearer to arrive at still : When I lose , or change this Jewel , Flie me faith , and heaven be cruel .
You have half confirm 'd me , Keep but that way sure , And what this charm can doe , let me endure. [ Exeunt.SCENA III .
Archas , Theodore , 2 Daughters Honora and Viola .
Carry your self discreetly , it concerns me , The Duke 's come in , none of your froward passions , Nor no distasts to any : Prethee Theodor , By my life , boy , 'twill ruine me .
I have done Sir , So there be no foul play he brings along with him .
What 's that to you ? Let him bring what please him , And whom , and how .
So they mean well --
Is't fit you be a Judge sirrah ?
'T is fit I feel Sir .
Get a banquet ready , And trim your selves up handsomly .
To what end ? Do you mean to make 'em whores ? Hang up a sign then , And set 'em out to Livery .
Whose son art thou ?
Yours Sir , I hope : but not of your disgraces .
Full twenty thousand men I have commanded , And all their minds , with this calm 'd all their angers ; And shall a boy of mine own breed too , of mine own blood , One crooked stick --
Pray take your way , and thrive i n't , I'le quit your house ; if taint or black dishonourLight on ye , 't is your own , I have no share in't.Yet if it do fall out so , as I fear it , And partly find it too --
Hast thou no reverence ? No dutie in thee ?
This shall shew I obey ye : I dare not stay : I would have shew 'd my love too , And that you ask as duty , with my life Sir , Had you but thought me worthy of your hazards , Which heaven preserve ye from , and keep the Duke too : And there 's an end of my wishes , God be with ye. [ Exit .
Stubborn , yet full of that we all love , honesty .
Burris.Lord Burris , where 's the Duke ?
In the great chamber Sir , And there stayes till he see you , ye 'have a fine house here .
A poor contented lodge , unfit for his presence , Yet all the joy it hath .
I hope a great one , and for your good , brave Sir .
I thank ye Lord : And now my service to the Duke .
I'le wait on ye. [ Exeunt .
Duke , Boroskey , Gent. and Attendants .
May this be credited ?
Disgrace me else , And never more with favour look upon me .
It seems impossible .
It can not chuse Sir , Till your own eyes behold it ; but that it is so , And that by this means the too haughtie SouldierHas been so cramm 'd and fed , he cares not for ye ; Believe , or let me perish : Let your eyesAs you observe the house , but where I point it , Make stay , and take a view , and then you have found it .
Archas , Burris , 2 Daughters , and Servant .
I'le follow your direction : welcome Archas , You are welcome home brave Lord , we are come to visit ye , And thank ye for your service .
'T was so poor Sir , In true respect of what I owe your Highness , It merits nothing .
Are these fair ones yours , Lord ?
Their Mother made me think so Sir .
Stand up Ladies : Beshrew my heart they are fair ones ; methinks fitterThe lustre of the Court , than thus live darken 'd : I would see your house Lord Archas , it appears to meA handsom pile .
'T is neat but no great structure ; I'le be your Graces guide , give me the keyes there .
Lead on , we'l follow ye : begin with the Gallery , I think that 's one .
'T is so , and't please ye , Sir , The rest above are lodgings all .
Go on , Sir. [ Exeunt.SCENE IV .
Theodore , Putskey , and Ancient .
The Duke gone thither , do you say ?
Yes marry do I , And all the Ducklings too ; but what they 'll do there --
I hope they 'll crown his service .
With a Custard ; This is no weather for rewards : they crown his service ? Rather they go to shave his Crown : I was ratedAs if I had been a Dog had worried Sheep , out of doors , For making but a doubt .
They must now grace him .
Mark but the end .
I am sure they should reward him , they can not want him .
They that want honesty , want any thing .
The Duke is so noble in his own thoughts .
That I grant ye , If those might only sway him : but 't is most certain , So many new born Flies his light gave life to , Buzze in his beams , Flesh-flies , and Butterflies , Hornets , and humming Scarabs , that not one honey BeeThat 's loaden with true labour , and brings homeEncrease and Credit , can 'scape rifling , And what she sucks for sweet , they turn to bitterness .
Shall we go see what they do , and talk our mind to 'em ?
That we have done too much , and to no purpose .
Shall we be hang 'd for him ? I have a great mind to be hang 'd nowFor doing some brave thing for him ; a worse end will take me , And for an action of no worth ; not honour him ? Upon my Conscience , even the Devil , the very Devil ( Not to belie him ) thinks him an honest man , I am sure he has sent him souls any time these twenty years , Able to furnish all his Fish-markets .
Leave thy talking , And come , let 's go to dinner and drink to him , We shall hear more ere supper time : if he be honour 'd , He has deserv 'd it well , and we shall fight for't : If he be ruin 'd , so , we know the worst then , And for my self , I 'll meet it .
I ne'r fear it. [ Exeunt.SCENE V .
, Archas , Boroskey , Burris , Gentlemen , andAttendants .
They are handsome rooms all , well contriv 'd and fitted , Full of convenience , the prospect 's excellent .
Now will your Grace pass down , and do me but the honourTo taste a Countrey Banquet ?
What room 's that ? I would see all now ; what conveyance has it ? I see you have kept the best part yet ; pray open it .
Ha ! I misdoubted this : 't is of no receipt , Sir , For your eyes most unfit --
I long to see it , Because I would judge of the whole piece : some excellent painting , Or some rare spoils you would keep to entertain meAnother time , I know .
In troth there is not , Nor any thing worth your sight ; below I haveSome Fountains , and some Ponds .
I would see this now .
Boroskie , thou art a Knave ; it contains nothingBut rubbish from the other rooms and unnecessaries : Will't please you see a strange Clock ?
This or nothing : [ Little Trunk ready.Why should you bar it up thus with defencesAbove the rest , unless it contain 'd somethingMore excellent , and curious of keeping ? Ope n't , for I will see it .
The Keys are lost , Sir : Does your Grace think if it were fit for you , I could be so unmannerly ?
I will see it , and either shew it --
Good Sir --
Thank ye , Archas , You shew your love abundantly , Do I use to entreat thus ? force it open .
That were inhospitable ; you are his Guest , Sir , And with his greatest joy , to entertain ye .
Hold thy peace , Fool ; will ye open it ?
Sir , I can not .I must not if I could .
Go , break it open .
I must withstand that force : Be not too rash , Gentlemen .
Unarm him first , then if he be not obstinatePreserve his life .
I thank your Grace , I take it ; And now take you the Keys , go in , and see , Sir ; There feed your eyes with wonder , and thank that Traytor , That thing that sells his faith for favour. [ Exit Duke .
Sir , what moves ye ?
I have kept mine pure : Lord Burris , there 's a Judas , That for a smile will sell ye all : a Gentleman ? The Devil has more truth , and has maintain 'd it ; A Whores heart more belief i n't .
What 's all this , Archas ? I can not blame you to conceal it so , This most inestimable Treasure .
Yours Sir .
Nor do I wonder now the Souldier sleights me .
I seek no Heaven from you , Sir .
Thy gnawing Hell , Boroskey , it will find thee : Would ye heap Coals upon his head has wrong 'd ye , Has ruin 'd your estate ? give him this money , Melt it into his mouth .
What little Trunk 's that ? That there o'th ' top , that 's lockt ?
You 'll find it rich , Sir , Richer I think than all .
You were not covetous , Nor wont to weave your thoughts with such a courseness ; Pray rack not Honesty .
Be sure you see it .
Bring out the Trunk .
You 'll find that treasure too , All I have left me now .
What 's this , a poor Gown ? And this a piece of Seneca ?
Yes sure , Sir , More worth than all your Gold , yet ye have enough o n't , And of a Mine far purer , and more precious ; This sells no friends , nor searches into counsels , And yet all counsel , and all friends live here , Sir ; Betrays no Faith , yet handles all that 's trusty : Will't please you leave me this ?
With all my heart , Sir .
What says your Lordship to't ?
I dare not rob ye .
Poor miserable men , you have rob 'd your selves both ; This Gown , and this unvalu 'd Treasure , your brave Father , Found me a Child at School with , in his progress.Where such a love he took to some few answers , Unhappy Boyish toys hit in my head then , That suddenly I made him , thus as I was , ( For here was all the Wealth I brought his Highness ) He carried me to Court , there bred me up , Bestow 'd his favours on me , taught me the Arms first , With those an honest mind ; I serv 'd him truly , And where he gave me trust , I think I fail 'd not ; Let the World speak : I humbly thank your Highness , You have done more , and nobler , eas 'd mine age , Sir ; And to this care a fair Quietus given , Now to my Book again .
You have your wish , Sir , Let some bring off the treasure .
Some is his , Sir .
None , none , a poor unworthy reaper , The Harvest is his Graces .
Thank you , Archas .
But will not you repent , Lord ? when this is goneWhere will your Lordship ? --
Pray take you no care , Sir .
Does your Grace like my House ?
Wondrous well , Archas , You have made me richly welcome .
I did my best , Sir.Is there any thing else may please your Grace ?
Your DaughtersI had forgot , send them to Court .
How 's that , Sir ?
I said your Daughters ; see it done : I 'll have 'emAttend my Sister , Archas .
Thank your Highness .
And suddenly. [ Exit .
Through all the ways I dare , I 'll serve your temper , though you try me far. [ Exit .
Theodore , Putskey , Ancient and Servant .
I wonder we hear no news .
Here 's your fathers servant , He comes in haste too , now we shall know all , Sir .
How now ?
I am glad I have met you , Sir ; your fatherIntreats you presently make haste unto him .
What news ?
None of the best , Sir , I am asham 'd to tell it , Pray ask no more .
Did not I tell ye , Gentlemen ? Did not I prophesie ? he 's undone then .
Not so , Sir , but as near it --
There 's no help now ; The Army 's scatter 'd all , through discontent , Not to be rallied up in haste to help this .
Plague of the Devil ; have ye watch 'd your seasons ? We shall watch you ere long .
Farewel , there 's no cure , We must endure all now : I know what I 'll do. [ Exeunt Theodore and Servant .
Nay , there 's no striving , they have a hand upon us , A heavy and a hard one .
Now I have it , We have yet some Gentlemen , some Boys of mettle , ( What , are we bob 'd thus still , colted , and carted ? ) And one mad trick we 'll have to shame these Vipers ; Shall I bless 'em ?
Farewel ; I have thought my way too. [ Exit .
Were never such rare Cries in Christendome , As Mosco shall afford : we 'll live by foolingNow fighting 's gone , and they shall find and feel it. [ Exit.SCENE II .
Archas , Honora , and Viola .
No more , it must be so ; do you think I would send ye , Your father and your friend --
Pray Sir , be good to us , Alas , we know no Court , nor seek that knowledge ; We are content with harmless things at home , Children of your content , bred up in quiet , Only to know our selves , to seek a WisedomeFrom that we understand , easie and honest ; To make our actions worthy of your Honour , Their ends as innocent as we begot 'em ; What shall we look for Sir , what shall we learn there , That this more private sweetness can not teach us ? Vertue was never built upon ambition , Nor the Souls Beauties bred out of Bravery : What a terrible Father would you seem to us , Now you have moulded us , and wrought our tempersTo easie and obedient ways , uncrooked , Where the fair mind can never lose nor loiter , Now to divert our Natures , now to stem usRoughly against the tide of all this treasure ? Would ye have us proud ? 't is sooner bred than buried ; Wickedly proud ? for such things dwell at Court , Sir .
Would ye have your Children learn to forget their father , And when he dies dance on his Monument ? Shall we seek Vertue in a Sattin Gown ; Embroider 'd Vertue ? Faith in a well-curl 'd Feather ? And set our Credits to the tune of green sleeves ? This may be done ; and if you like , it shall be.You should have sent us thither when we were younger , Our maiden-heads at a higher rate ; our InnocenceAble to make a Mart indeed : we are now too old , Sir , Perhaps they 'll think too cunning too , and slight us ; Besides , we are altogether unprovided , Unfurnisht utterly of the rules should guide us : This Lord comes , licks his hand , and protests to me ; Compares my Beauty to a thousand fine things ; Mountains , and Fountains , Trees , and Stars , and Goblins ; Now have not I the faith for to believe him ; He offers me the honourable courtesie , To lye with me all night , what a misery is this ? I am bred up so foolishly , alas , I dare not , And how madly these things will shew there .
I thank you Sir , you have made me half a Souldier , I will to Court most willingly , most fondly.And if there be such stirring things amongst 'em , Such Travellers into VirginiaAs Fame reports , if they can win me , take me ; I think I have a close Ward , and a sure one ; An honest mind I hope , 't is petticoat-proof , Chain-proof , and Jewel-proof ; I know 't is Gold-proof , A Coach and four Horses can not draw me from it : As for your handsome Faces , and filed Tongues , Curl 'd Millers heads , I have another word for them , And yet I 'll flatter too , as fast as they do , And lye , but not as lewdly ; Come , be valiant , Sister , She that dares not stand the push o'th ' Court , dares nothing , And yet come off ungraced : Sir , like you , We both affect great dangers now , and the World shall seeAll glory lies not in Mans Victorie .
Mine own Honora .
I am very fearful , Would I were stronger built : you would have me honest ?
Or not at all my Viola .
I 'll think o n't , For 't is no easie promise , and live there : Do you think we shall do well ?
Why , what should aile us ?
Certain they 'll tempt us strongly ; beside the gloryWhich Women may affect , they are handsom Gentlemen , Every part speaks : nor is it one denial , Nor two , nor ten ; from every look we give 'em , They 'll frame a hope ; even from our prayers , promises .
Let 'em feed so , and be fat ; there is no fear , wench , I [ f ] thou beest fast to thy self .
I hope I shall be ; And your example will work more .
Theodore .
Thou shalt not want it .
How do you , Sir ? can you lend a man an Angel ? I hear you let out money .
Very well , Sir , You are pleasantly dispos 'd : I am glad to see it.Can you lend me your patience , and be rul 'd by me ?
Is't come to patience now ?
Is't not a Vertue ?
I know not : I ne'r found it so .
That 's becauseThy anger ever knows , and not thy judgment .
I know you have been rifl 'd .
Nothing less , Boy ; Lord , what opinions these vain People publish ! Rifl 'd of what ?
Study your Vertue , Patience , It may get Mustard to your Meat. Why in such haste , Sir , Sent ye for me ?
For this end only , Theodore , To wait upon your Sisters to the Court ; I am commanded they live there .
To th ' Court , Sir ?
To th ' Court I say .
And must I wait upon 'em ?
Yes , 't is most fit you should , you are their Brother .
Is this the business ? I had thought your mind , Sir , Had been set forward on some noble action , Something had truly stir 'd ye. To th ' Court with these ? Why , they are your Daughters , Sir .
All this I know , Sir .
The good old Woman on a Bed he threw : To th ' Court ?
Thou art mad .
Nor drunk as you are : Drunk with your duty , Sir : do you call it duty ? A pox of duty , what can these do there ? What should they do ? Can ye look Babies , Sisters , In the young Gallants eyes , and twirl their Band-strings ? Can ye ride out to air your selves ? Pray Sir , Be serious with me , do you speak this truly ?
Why , didst thou never hear of WomenYet at Court , Boy ?
Yes , and good Women too , very good Women , Excellent honest Women : but are you sure , Sir , That these will prove so ?
There 's the danger , Brother .
God-a-mercy Wench , thou hast a grudging of it .
Now be you serious , Sir , and observe what I say , Do it , and do it handsomly ; go with 'em .
With all my heart , Sir ; I am in no fault now ; If they be thought Whores for being in my Company ; Pray write upon their Backs , they are my Sisters , And where I shall deliver 'em .
Ye are wondrous jocund , But prithee tell me , art thou so lewd a Fellow ? I never knew thee fail a truth .
I am a Souldier , And spell you what that means .
A Souldier ? What dost thou make of me ?
Your Palate 's down , Sir .
I thank ye , Sir .
Come , shall we to this matter ? You will to Court ?
If you will please to honour us .
I 'll honour ye , I warrant ; I 'll set ye offWith such a lustre , Wenches ; alas poor Viola , Thou art a fool , thou criest for eating white bread : Be a good Huswife of thy tears , and save 'em , Thou wilt have time enough to shed 'em , Sister.Do you weep too ? nay , then I 'll fool no more.Come worthy Sisters , since it must be so , And since he thinks it fit to try your Vertues , Be you as strong to truth , as I to guard ye , And this old Gentleman shall have joy of ye.

Burris .
Burris take you ten thousand of those Crowns , And those two Chains of Pearl they hold the richest , I give 'em ye .
I humbly thank your Grace ; And may your great example work in meThat noble Charity to men more worthy , And of more wants .
You bear a good mind , Burris ; Take twenty thousand now : be not so modest , It shall be so , I give 'em : go , there 's my ring for't .
Heaven bless your Highness ever. [ Exit .
You are honest .
Alinda , and Putskey at door .
They 're coming now to Court , as fair as vertue : Two brighter Stars ne'er rose here .
Peace , I have it , And what my Art can do ; the Duke --
I am gone , Remember. [ Exit .
I am counsell 'd to the full , Sir .
My pretty Mistris , whither lyes your business ? How kindly I should take this , were it to me now ?
I must confess immediately to your Grace , At this time .
You have no address , I do believe ye , I would ye had .
'Twere too much boldness , Sir , Upon so little knowledge , less deserving .
You 'll make a perfect Courtier .
A very poor one .
A very fair one , sweet ; come hither to me.What killing eyes this Wench has ! in his gloryNot the bright Sun , when the Sirian Star reigns , Shines half so fiery .
Why does your Grace so view me ? Nothing but common handsomness dwells here , Sir , Scarce that : your Grace is pleas 'd to mock my meanness .
Thou shalt not go : I do not lie unto thee , In my eye thou appear'st --
Dim not the sight , Sir , I am too dull an object .
Canst thou love me ? Canst thou love him will honour thee ?
I can love , And love as you do too : but 'twill not shew well : Or if it do shew here where all light lustres , Tinsel affections make a glorious glistering , 'Twill halt i'th ' handsom way .
Are ye so cunning ? Dost think I love not truly ?
No , ye can not , You never travel 'd that way yet : pray pardon me , I prate so boldly to you .
There 's no harm done : But what 's your reason , sweet ?
I would tell your Grace , But happily --
It shall be pleasing to me .
I should love you again , and then you would hate me.With all my service I should follow ye , And through all dangers .
This would more provoke me , More make me see thy worths , More make me meet 'em .
You should do so , if ye did well and truly : But though ye be a Prince , and have power in ye , Power of example too , ye have fail 'd and falter 'd .
Give me example where ?
You had a Mistris , Oh Heaven , so bright , so brave a dame , so lovely , In all her life so true !
A Mistris ?
That serv 'd you with that constancy , that care , That lov 'd your will , and woo 'd it too .
What Mistris ?
That nurs 'd your honour up , held fast your vertue , And when she kist encreas 'd , not stole your goodness .
And I neglected her ?
Lost her , forsook her , Wantonly flung her off .
What was her name ?
Her name as lovely as her self , as noble , And in it all that 's excellent .
What was it ?
Her name was Beau-desert : Do you know her now , Sir ?
Beau-desert ? I do not remember --
I know you do not ; Yet she has a plainer name ; Lord Archas service ; Do you yet remember her ? there was a MistrisFairer than Woman , far fonder to you , Sir , Than Mothers to their first-born joyes : Can you love ? Dare you profess that truth to me a stranger , A thing of no regard , no name , no lustre , When your most noble love you have neglected , A beauty all the world would woo and honour ? Would you have me credit this ? think you can love me , And hold ye constant , when I have read this story ? Is't possible you should ever favour me , To a slight pleasure prove a friend , and fast too , When , where you were most ty 'd , most bound to benefit , Bound by the chains of honesty and honour , You have broke and boldly too ? I am a weak one , Arm 'd only with my fears : I beseech your GraceTempt me no further .
Who taught you this Lesson ?
Woful experience , Sir : if you seek a fair one , Worthy your love , if yet you have that perfect , Two Daughters of his ruin 'd vertue nowArrive at Court , excellent fair indeed , Sir , But this will be the Plague o n't , they 're excellent honest .
Olympia and Petesca privately .
I love thy face .
Upon my life ye can not : I do not love it my self , Sir , 't is a lewd one , So truly ill Art can not mend it ; but if 'twere handsome , At least if I thought so , you should hear me talk , Sir , In a new strain ; and though ye are a Prince , Make ye Petition to me too , and wait my answers ; Yet o ' my Conscience I should pity ye , After some ten years siege .
Prethee do now .
What would ye do ?
Why I would lye with ye .
I do not think ye would .
In troth I would Wench.Here , take this Jewel .
Out upo n't , that 's scurvy.Nay , if we do , sure we 'll do for good fellowship , For pure love , or nothing : thus you shall be sure , Sir , You shall not pay too dear for't .
Sure I can not .
By'r Lady but ye may : when ye have found me ableTo do your work well , ye may pay my wages .
Why does your Grace start back ?
I ha ' seen that shakes me : Chills all my bloud : O where is faith or goodness ?
thou art false , false , false thou fair one , Wickedness false ; and ( wo is me ) I see it.For ever false .
I am glad 't has taken thus right. [ Exeunt .
I'le go ask my Lady , Sir .
What ?
Whether I shall lye with ye , or no : If I find her willing -- For look ye Sir , I have sworn , while I am in her service -- ( 'T was a rash Oath I must confess . )
Thou mockst me .
Why , would ye lye with me , if I were willing ? Would you abuse my weakness ?
I would piece it , And make it stronger .
I humbly thank your highness , When you piece me , you must piece me to my Coffin : When you have got my Maiden-head , I take it , 'T is not an inch of an Apes tail will restore it , I love ye , and I honour ye , but this wayI'le neither love nor serve ye.Heaven change your mind , Sir. [ Exit .

Thank ye Brother .
This is not so strongly built : but she is good mettle , Of a good stirring strain too : she goes tith , Sir .
Here they be , Gentlemen , must make ye merry , The toyes you wot of : do you like their complexions ? They be no Moors : what think ye of this hand , Gentlemen ? Here 's a white Altar for your sacrifice : A thousand kisses here. Nay , keep off yet Gentlemen , Let 's start first , and have fair play : what would ye give nowTo turn the Globe up , and find the rich Moluccas ? To pass the straights ? here ( do ye itch ) by St Nicholas , Here 's that will make ye scratch and claw , Claw my fine Gentlemen , move ye in divers sorts : Pray ye let me request ye , to forgetTo say your prayers , whilest these are Courtiers ; Or if ye needs will think of Heaven , let it be no higherThan their eyes .
How will ye have 'em bestow 'd , Sir ?
Even how your Lordship please , So you do not bake 'em .
Bake 'em ?
They are too high a meat that way , they run to gelly.But if you 'll have 'em for your own diet , take my counsel , Stew 'em between two Feather-beds .
Please you ColonelTo let 'em wait upon the Princess ?
Yes , Sir , And thank your honour too : but then happily , These noble Gentlemen shall have no access to 'em , And to have 'em buy new Cloaths , study new faces , And keep a stinking stir with themselves for nothing , 'Twill not be well i'faith : they have kept their bodies , And been at charge for Bathes : do you see that shirt there ? Weigh but the moral meaning , 'twill be grievous : Alas , I brought 'em to delight these Gentlemen , I weigh their wants by mine : I brought 'em wholesome , Wholesome , and young my Lord , and two such blessingsThey will not light upon again in ten years .
'T is fit they wait upon her .
They are fit for any thing : They 'll wait upon a man , they are not bashful , Carry his Cloak , or unty his points , or any thing , Drink drunk , and take Tobacco ; the familiar'st fools -- This wench will leap over Stools too , and sound a Trumpet , Wrastle , and pitch the Bar ; they are finely brought up .
Ladies , ye are bound to your Brother , And have much cause to thank him : I'le ease ye of this charge , and to the Princess , So please you , I'le attend 'em .

The only reason is , To sweep your Lordships conscience : here 's one for the nonce.Gape Sir , you have swallowed many a goodlier matter -- The only casting for a crazie conscience .
Will your Lordship buy any honestie ? 'twill be worth your mony .

You must not be so fearfull , little one , Nor Lady you so sad , you will ne 're make CourtiersWith these dull sullen thoughts ; this place is pleasure , Preserv 'd to that use , so inhabited ; And those that live here , live delightfull , joyfull : These are the Gardens of Adonis , Ladies , Where all sweets to their free and noble uses , Grow ever young and courted .
Bless me Heaven , Can things of her years arrive at these rudiments ? By your leave fair Gentlewoman , how long have you been here ?
Faith much about a week .
You have studied hard , And by my faith arriv 'd at a great knowledge .
Were not you bashfull at first ?
I , I , for an hour or two : But when I saw people laugh 'd at me for it , And thought it a dull breeding --
You are govern 'd here thenMuch after the mens opinions .
Ever Lady .
And what they think is honourable. --
Most preciselyWe follow with all faith .
A goodly Catechisme .
But bashfull for an hour or two ?
Faith to say true , I do not think I was so long : for look ye , 'T is to no end here , put on what shape ye will , And soure your self with ne 're so much austeritie , You shall be courted in the same , and won too , 'T is but some two hours more ; and so much time lost , Which we hold pretious here : In so much time nowAs I have told you this , you may lose a Servant , Your age , nor all your Art can e 're recover.Catch me occasion as she comes , hold fast there , Till what you do affect is ripn 'd to ye.Has the Duke seen ye yet ?
What if he have not ?
You do your beauties too much wrong , appearingSo full of sweetness , newness ; set so richly , As if a Counsel beyond nature fram 'd ye .
If we were thus , say heaven had given these blessings , Must we turn these to sin-oblations ?
How foolishly this Countrey way shews in ye ? How full of flegm ? do you come here to pray , Ladies ? You had best cry , stand away , let me alone Gentlemen , I'le tell my Father else .
This woman 's naught sure , A very naughtie woman .
Come , say on friend , I'le be instructed by ye .
You'l thank me for't .
Either I or the devil shall : The Duke you were speaking of .
'T is well remembred : yes , let him first see you , Appear not openly till he has view 'd ye .
He 's a very noble Prince they say .
O wondrous gracious ; And as you may deliver your self at the first viewing.For look ye , you must bear your self ; yet take heedIt be so season 'd with a sweet humilitie , And grac 'd with such a bountie in your beautie --
But I hope he will offer me no ill ?
No , no : 'T is like he will kiss ye , and play with ye .
Play with me , how ?
Why , good Lord , that you are such a fool now ! No harm assure your self .
Will he play with me too ?
Look babies in your eyes , my prettie sweet one : There 's a fine sport : do you know your lodgings yet ?
I hear of none .
I do then , they are handsom , Convenient for access .
Access ?
Yes little one , For visitation of those friends and Servants , Your beauties shall make choice of : friends and visits : Do not you know those uses ? Alas poor novice ; There 's a close Cowch or two , handsomely placed too .
What are those I pray you ?
Who would be troubled with such raw things ? they are to lie upon , And your love by ye ; and discourse , and toy in .
Alas I have no love .
You must by any means : You'l have a hundred , fear not .
Honestie keep me : What shall I doe with all those ?
You'l find uses : Ye are ignorant yet , let time work ; you must learn too , To lie handsomly in your bed a mornings , neatly drestIn a most curious Wastcoat , to set ye off well , Play with your Bracelets , sing : you must learn to rhime too , And riddle neatly ; studie the hardest language , And 't is no matter whether it be sense , or no , So it go seemlie off. Be sure ye profitIn kissing , kissing sweetly : there lies a main point , A key that opens to all practick pleasure ; I'le help ye to a friend of mine shall teach ye , And suddenlie : your Country way is fulsome .
Have ye schools for all these mysteries ?
O yes , And several hours prefix 'd to studie in : Ye may have Kalenders to know the good hour , And when to take a jewel : for the ill too , When to refuse , with observations on 'em ; Under what Sign 't is best meeting in an Arbor , And in what Bower , and hour it works ; a thousand , When in a Coach , when in a private lodging , With all their vertues .
Have ye studied these ? How beastly they become your youth ? how bawdily ? A woman of your tenderness , a teacher , Teacher of these lewd Arts ? of your full beauty ? A man made up in lust would loath this in ye : The rankest Leacher , hate such impudence.They say the Devil can assume heavens brightness , And so appear to tempt us : sure thou art no woman .
I joy to find ye thus .
Thou hast no tenderness , No reluctation in thy heart : 't is mischief .

By your own fair hands I understand ye not .
By thy own fair eyes I understand thee too much , Too far , and built a faith there thou hast ruin'd.Goe , and enjoy thy wish , thy youth , thy pleasure , Enjoy the greatness no doubt he has promised , Enjoy the service of all eyes that see thee , The glory thou hast aim 'd at , and the triumph : Only this last love I ask , forget thy Mistris .
Oh , who has wrong 'd me ? who has ruin 'd me ? Poor wretched Girle , what poyson is flung on thee ? Excellent vertue , from whence flows this anger ?

You are weary of me ; I must confess , I was never worth your service , Your bounteous favours less ; but that my duty , My ready will , and all I had to serve ye -- O Heaven thou know'st my honestie .

Must I goe from ye ? Of all the sorrows sorrow has -- must I part with ye ? Part with my noble Mistris ?
Or I with thee wench .
And part stain 'd with opinion ?

I confess Madam , Truely confess , the Duke has often courted me .
And pour 'd his Soul into thee , won thee .
Do you think so ? Well , time that told this tale , will tell my truth too , And say ye had a faithfull , honest Servant : The business of my life is now to pray for ye , Pray for your vertuous loves ; Pray for your children , When Heaven shall make ye happy .
How she wounds me ! Either I am undone , or she must go : take these with ye , Some toyes may doe ye service ; and this mony ; And when ye want , I love ye not so poorly , Not yet Alinda , that I would see ye perish.Prethee be good , and let me hear : look on me , I love those eyes yet dearly ; I have kiss 'd thee , And now I'le doe't again : Farewel Alinda , I am too full to speak more , and too wretched.

What 's the news man ?
That that concerns us all , and very nearly : The Duke this night holds a great feast at Court , To which he bids for guests all his old Counsellors , And all his favourites : your Father 's sent for .
Why he is neither in council , nor in favour .
That 's it : have an eye now , or never , and a quick one , An eye that must not wink from good intelligence.I heard a Bird sing , they mean him no good office .

Is't not a place created for all sweetness ? Why were you made such strangers to this happiness ? Barr 'd the delights this holds ? the richest jewelsSet ne 're so well , if then not worn to wonder , By judging eyes not set off , lose their lustre : Your Country shades are faint ; blasters of beauty ; The manners like the place , obscure and heavie ; The Rose buds of the beauties turn to cankers , Eaten with inward thoughts : whilst there ye wander.Here Ladies , here , you were not made for Cloisters , Here is the Sphere you move in : here shine nobly , And by your powerfull influence command all : What a sweet modestie dwells round about 'em , And like a nipping morn pulls in their blossoms ?
A brave spirited wench .

She amazes me : But how am I deceiv 'd ?
O we are too honest , Believe it Sir , too honest , far too honest , The way that you propound too ignorant , And there is no medling with us ; for we are fools too , Obstinate , peevish fools : if I would be ill , And had a wantons itch , to kick my heels up , I would not leap into th ' Sun , and doe't there , That all the world might see me : an obscure shade Sir , Dark as the deed , there is no trusting light with it , Nor that that 's lighter far , vain-glorious greatness .

I will honour ye , As your poor humble handmaid serve , and pray for ye .
What sayes my little one ; you are not so obstinate ? Lord how she blushes : here are truly fair souls : Come you will be my love ?
Good Sir be good to me , Indeed I'le doe the best I can to please ye ; I do beseech your grace : Alas I fear ye .
What shouldst thou fear ?
Fie Sir , this is not noble .
Why do I stand entreating , where my power --
You have no power , at least you ought to have noneIn bad and beastly things : arm 'd thus , I'le dye here , Before she suffer wrong .

Yes : I love to see ye , And could look on an age thus , and admire ye : Whilst ye are good and temperate I dare touch ye , Kiss your white hand .
Why not my lips ?
I dare Sir .
I do not think ye dare .
I am no coward.D [ o ] you believe me now ? or now ? or now Sir ? You make me blush : but sure I mean no ill Sir : It had been fitter you had kiss 'd me .
That I'le doe too.What hast thou wrought into me ?
I hope all goodness : Whilst ye are thus , thus honest , I dare do any thing , Thus hang about your neck , and thus doat on ye ; Bless those fair lights : hell take me if I durst not -- But good Sir pardon me. Sister come hither , Come hither , fear not wench : come hither , blush not , Come kiss the Prince , the vertuous Prince , the good Prince : Certain he is excellent honest .
Thou wilt make me --
Sit down , and hug him softly .
Fie Honora , Wanton Honora ; is this the modesty , The noble chastity your on-set shew 'd me , At first charge beaten back ? Away .
Thank ye : Upon my knees I pray , heaven too may thank ye ; Ye have deceiv 'd me cunningly , yet noblyYe have cozen 'd me : In all your hopefull life yet , A Scene of greater honour you ne 're acted : I knew fame was a lyar , too long , and loud tongu 'd , And now I have found it : O my vertuous Master .
My vertuous Master too .
Now you are thus , What shall become of me let fortune cast for't .
Alinda .
I'le be that fortune , if I live Honora , Thou hast done a cure upon me , counsel could not .
Here take your ring Sir , and whom ye mean to ruine , Give it to her next ; I have paid for't dearly .
A Ring to her ?
Why frowns my fair Alinda ? I have forgot both these again .
Stand still Sir , Ye have that violent killing fire upon ye , Consumes all honour , credit , faith .
How 's this ?
My Royal Mistris favour towards me , Woe-worth ye Sir , ye have poyson 'd , blasted .
I sweet ?
You have taken that unmanly liberty , Which in a worse man , is vain glorious feigning , And kill 'd my truth .
Upon my life 't is false wench .
Ladies , Take heed , ye have a cunning gamester , A handsom , and a high ; come stor 'd with Antidotes , He has infections else will fire your blouds .
Prethee Alinda hear me .
Words steept in hony , That will so melt into your minds , buy Chastity , A thousand wayes , a thousand knots to tie ye ; And when he has bound ye his , a thousand ruines.A poor lost woman ye have made me .
I'le maintain thee , And nobly too .
That Gin 's too weak to take me : Take heed , take heed young Ladies : still take heed , Take heed of promises , take heed of gifts , Of forced feigned sorrows , sighs , take heed .
By all that 's mine , Alinda --
SwearBy your mischiefs : O whither shall I goe ?
Go back again , I'le force her take thee , love thee .
Fare ye well , Sir , I will not curse ye ; only this dwell with ye , When ever ye love , a false belief light on ye. [ Exit .
We 'll take our leaves too , Sir .
Part all the world now , Since she is gone .
You are crooked yet , dear Master , And still I fear -- [ Exeunt .

Archas and a Servant .
'T is strangeTo me to see the Court , and welcome : O Royal place , how have I lov 'd and serv 'd thee ? Who lies on this side , know'st thou ?
The Lord Burris .
Thou hast nam 'd a GentlemanI stand much bound to : I think he sent the Casket , Sir ?
The same , Sir .
An honest minded man , a noble Courtier : The Duke made perfect choice when he took him.Go you home , I shall hit the wayWithout a guide now .
You may want something , Sir .
Only my Horses , Which after Supper let the Groom wait with : I'le have no more attendance here .
Your will , Sir. [ Exit .
Theodore .
You are well met here , Sir .
How now boy , How dost thou ?
I should askYou that question : how do you , Sir ? How do you feel your self ?
Why well , and lusty .
What do you here then ?
Why I am sent forTo Supper with the Duke .
Have you no meat at home ? Or do you long to feed as hunted Deer do , In doubt and fear ?
I have an excellent stomach , And can I use it betterThan among my friends , Boy ? How do the Wenches ?
They do well enough , Sir , They know the worst by this time : pray be rul 'd , Sir , Go home again , and if ye have a Supper , Eat it in quiet there : this is no place for ye , Especially at this time , Take my word for't .
May be they 'll drink hard ; I could have drunk my share , Boy.Though I am old , I will not out .
I hope you will.Hark in your ear : the Court'sToo quick of hearing .
Not mean me well ? Thou art abus 'd and cozen'd.Away , away .
To that end Sir , I tell ye.Away , if you love your self .
Who dare do these things , That ever heard of honesty ?
Old Gentleman , Take a fools counsel .
'T is a fools indeed ; A very fools : thou hast more ofThese flams in thee , these musty doubts : Is't fit the Duke send for me , And honour me to eat within his presence , And I , like a tale fellow , play at bo-peepWith his pleasure ?
Take heedOf bo-peep with your pate , your pate , Sir , I speak plain language now .
If 'twere not here , Where reverence bids me hold , I would so swinge thee , thou rude , Unmanner 'd Knave ; take from his bounty , His honour that he gives me , to begetSawcy , and sullen fears ?
You are not mad sure : By this fair light , I speakBut what is whisper 'd , And whisper 'd for a truth .
A Dog : drunken people , That in their Pot see visions , And turn states , mad-men and Children : Prethee do not follow me ; I tell thee I am angry : Do not follow me .
I am as angryAs you for your heart , I and as wilful too : go , like a Wood-cock , And thrust your neck i'th ' noose .
I'le kill thee , And thou speakst but three words more.Do not follow me. [ Exit .
A strange old foolish fellow : I shall hear yet , And if I do not my part , hiss at me. [ Exit.SCENE V .
Believe me fellow here will be lusty drinking.Many a washt pate in Wine I warrant thee .
I am glad the old General 's come : upon my ConscienceThat joy will make half the Court drunk. Hark the Trumpets , They are coming on ; away .
We 'll have a rowse too. [ Exeunt .
, Archas , Burris , Boroskie , Attend. Gent .
Come seat your selves : Lord Archas sit you there .
'T is far above my worth .
I'le have it so : Are all things ready ?
All the Guards are set , The Court Gates are shut .
Then do as I prescrib 'd ye.Be sure no further .
I shall well observe ye .
Come bring some wine : here 's to my Sister , Gentlemen ; A health , and mirth to all .
Pray fill it full , Sir.'Tis a high health to vertue : here Lord Burris , A maiden health : you are most fit to pledge it , You have a maiden soul and much I honour it.Passion o ' me , ye are sad man .
How now , Burris ? Go to , no more of this .
Take the rowse freely , 'Twill warm your bloud , and make ye fit for jollity.Your Graces pardon : when we get a cup , Sir , We old men prate a pace .
Mirth makes a Banquet ; As you love me no more .
I thank your Grace.Give me it ; Lord Boroskie .
I have ill brains , Sir .
Damnable ill , I know it .
But I'le pledge , Sir , This vertuous health .
The more unfit for thy mouth .
Come , bring out Robes , and let my guests look nobly , Fit for my love and presence : begin downward.Off with your Cloaks , take new .
Your grace deals truly , Like a munificent Prince , with your poor subjects , Who would not fight for you ? what cold dull cowardDurst seek to save his life when you would ask it ? Begin a new health in your new adornments , The Dukes , the Royal Dukes : ha ! what have I gotSir ? ha ! the Robe of death ?
You have deserv 'd it .
The Livery of the Grave ? do you start all from me ? Do I smell of earth already ? Sir , look on me , And like a man ; is this your entertainment ? Do you bid your worthiest guests to bloudy Banquets ?
A Guard upon me too ? this is too foul playBoy to thy good , thine honour : thou wretched Ruler , Thou Son of fools and flatterers , Heir of hypocrites , Am I serv 'd in a Hearse that sav 'd ye all ? Are ye men or Devils ? Do ye gape upon me , Wider , and swallow all my services ? Entomb them first , my faith next , then my integrity , And let these struggle with your mangy minds , Your sear 'd , and seal 'd up Consciences , till they burst .
These words are death .
No those deeds that want rewards , Sirrah , Those Battels I have fought , those horrid dangers , Leaner than death , and wilder than destruction , I have march 'd upon , these honour 'd wounds , times story , The bloud I have lost , the youth , the sorrows suffer 'd , These are my death , these that can ne 're be recompenced , These that ye sit a brooding on like Toads , Sucking from my deserts the sweets and favours , And render me no pay again but poysons .
The proud vain Souldier thou hast set --
Exceed not my command. [ Exit .
I shall observe it .
Are you gone too ? Come weep not honest Burris , Good loving Lord , no more tears : 't is not his malice , This fellows malice , nor the Dukes displeasure , By bold bad men crowded into his nature , Can startle me : fortune ne 're raz 'd this Fort yet : I am the same , the same man , living , dying ; The same mind to 'em both , I poize thus equal ; Only the jugling way that toll 'd me to it , The Judas way , to kiss me , bid me welcome , And cut my throat , a little sticks upon me.Farewel , commend me to his Grace , and tell him , The world is full of servants , he may have many : And some I wish him honest : he 's undone else : But such another doating Archas never , So try 'd and touch 'd a faith : farewell for ever .
Be strong my Lord : you must not go thus lightly .
Now , what 's to do ? what sayes the Law unto me ? Give me my great offence that speaks me guil [ t ] y .
Laying aside a thousand petty matters , As scorns , and insolencies both from your self and followers , Which you put first fire to , and these are deadly , I come to one main cause , which though it carriesA strangeness in the circumstance , it carries death too , Not to be pardon 'd neither : ye have done a sacriledge .
High Heaven defend me man : how , how Boroskie ?
Ye have took from the Temple those vow 'd Arms , The holy Ornament you hung up there , No absolution of your vow , no orderFrom holy Church to give 'em back unto youAfter they were purified from War , and restedFrom bloud , made clean by ceremony : from the AltarYou snatch 'd 'em up again , again ye wore 'em , Again you stain 'd 'em , stain 'd your vow , the Church too , And rob 'd it of that right was none of yours , Sir , For which the Law requires your head , ye know it .
Those arms I fought in last ?
The same .
God a mercy , Thou hast hunted out a notable cause to kill me : A subtle one : I dye , for saving all you ; Good Sir , remember if you can , the necessity , The suddenness of time , the state all stood in ; I was entreated to , kneel 'd to , and pray 'd to , The Duke himself , the Princes , all the Nobles , The cries of Infants , Bed-rid Fathers , Virgins ; Prethee find out a better cause , a handsomer , This will undo thee too : people will spit at thee , The Devil himself would be asham 'd of this cause ; Because my haste made me forget the ceremony , The present danger every where , must my life satisfie ?
It must , and shall .
O base ungrateful people , Have ye no other Swords to cut my throat withBut mine own nobleness ? I confess , I took 'em , The vow not yet absolv 'd I hung 'em up with : Wore 'em , fought in 'em , gilded 'em againIn the fierce Tartars blouds ; for you I took 'em , For your peculiar safety , Lord , for all , I wore 'em for my Countries health , that groan 'd then : Took from the Temple , to preserve the Temple ; That holy place , and all the sacred monuments , The reverent shrines of Saints , ador 'd and honour 'd , Had been consum 'd to ashes , their own sacrifice ; Had I been slack , or staid that absolution , No Priest had liv 'd to give it ; my own honour , Cure of my Country murder me ?
No , no Sir , I shall force that from ye , will make this cause light too , Away with him : I shall pluck down that heart , Sir .
Break it thou mayest ; but if it bend , for pity , Doggs , and Kites eat it : come I am honours Martyr. [ Ex.SCENE VI .
Burris .
Exceed my Warrant ?
You know he loves him not .
He dares as well eat death , as do it , eat wild-fire , Through a few fears I mean to try his goodness , That I may find him fit , to wear here , Burris ; I know Boroskie hates him , to death hates him , I know he 's a Serpent too , a swoln one , [ Noise within.But I have pull 'd his sting out : what noise is that ?
Down with 'em , down with 'em , down with the gates .
Stand , stand , stand .
Fire the Palace before ye .
Upon my life the Souldier , Sir , the Souldier , A miserable time is come .
Oh save him , Upon my knees , my hearts knees , save Lord Archas , We are undone else .
Dares he touch his Body ?
He racks him fearfully , most fearfully .
Away Burris , Take men , and take him from him ; clap him up , And if I live , I 'll find a strange death for him. [ Ex. Bur.Are the Souldiers broke in ?
By this time sure they are , Sir , They beat the Gates extreamly , beat the people .
Get me a guard about me ; make sure the lodgings , And speak the Souldiers fair .
Pray Heaven that take , Sir. [ Exeunt .
Putskie , Ancient , Souldiers , with Torches .
Give us the General , we 'll fire the Court else , Render him safe and well .
Do not fire the Cellar , There 's excellent Wine i n't , Captain , and though it be cold weather , I do not love it mull 'd ; bring out the General , We 'll light ye such a Bone-fire else : where are ye ? Speak , or we 'll toss your Turrets , peep out of your Hives , We 'll smoak ye else : Is not that a Nose there ? Put out that Nose again , and if thou dar'stBut blow it before us : now he creeps out on 's Burrough .
Give us the General .
Yes , Gentlemen ; Or any thing ye can desire .
You musk-cat , Cordevant-skin we will not take your answer .
Where is the Duke ? speak suddenly , and send him hither .
Or we 'll so frye your Buttocks .
Good sweet Gentlemen --
We are neither good nor sweet , we are Souldiers , And you miscreants that abuse the General.Give fire my Boys , 't is a dark Evening , Let 's light 'em to their lodgings .
Olympia , Honora , Viola , Theodore , Women .
Good Brother be not fierce .
I will not hurt her , Fear not sweet Lady .
Nay , do what you please , Sir , I have a sorrow that exceeds all yours , And more , contemns all danger .
Where is the Duke ?
He 's here ; what would ye Souldiers ? wherefore troop yeLike mutinous mad-men thus ?
Give me my Father .
Give us our General .
Set him here before us , Ye see the pledge we have got ; ye see the Torches ; All shall to ashes , as I live , immediately , A thousand lives for one .
But hear me ?
No , we come not to dispute .
Archas , and Burris .
By Heaven I swear he 's rackt and whipt .
Oh my poor Father !
Burn , kill and burn .
Hold , hold , I say : hold Souldiers , On your allegiance hold .
We must not .
Hold : I swear by Heaven he is a barbarous Traitor stirs first , A Villain , and a stranger to Obedience , Never my Souldier more , nor Friend to Honour : Why did you use your old Man thus ? thus cruellyTorture his poor weak Body ? I ever lov 'd ye .
Forget me in these wrongs , most noble Archas .
They have drawn blood from you , Sir .
That was the blood rebell 'd , the naughty blood , The proud provoking blood ; 't is well 't is out , Boy ; Give you example first ; draw out , and orderly .
Good Brother , do .
Honest and high example , As thou wilt have my Blessing follow thee , Inherit all mine honours : thank ye Theodore , My worthy Son .
If harm come , thank your self , Sir , I must obey ye. [ Exit .
Captain , you know the way now : A good man , and a valiant , you were ever , Inclin 'd to honest things ; I thank ye , Captain. [ Ex. Soul.Souldiers , I thank ye all : and love me still , But do not love me so you lose Allegiance , Love that above your lives : once more I thank ye .
Bring him to rest , and let our cares wait on him ; Thou excellent old man , thou top of honour , Where Justice , and Obedience only build , Thou stock of Vertue , how am I bound to love thee ! In all thy noble ways to follow thee !
Remember him that vext him , Sir .
Remember ? When I forget that Villain , and to pay himFor all his mischiefs , may all good thoughts forget me .
I am very sore .
Bring him to Bed with ease , Gentlemen , For every stripe I 'll drop a tear to wash 'em , And in my sad Repentance --
'T is too much , I have a life yet left to gain that love , Sir. [ Exeunt .
, Burris , and Gentlemen .
How does Lord Archas ?
But weak , and't please ye ; Yet all the helps that art can , are applied to him ; His heart 's untoucht , and whole yet ; and no doubt , Sir , His mind being sound , his body soon will follow .
O that base Knave that wrong 'd him , without leave too ; But I shall find an hour to give him thanks for't ; He 's fast , I hope .
As fast as irons can keep him : But the most fearful Wretch --
He has a Conscience , A cruel stinging one I warrant him , A loaden one : But what news of the Souldier ? I did not like their parting , 't was too sullen .
That they keep still , and I fear a worse clap ; They are drawn out of the Town , and stand in counsels , Hatching unquiet thoughts , and cruel purposes : I went my self unto 'em , talkt with the Captains , Whom I found fraught with nothing but loud murmurs , And desperate curses , sounding these words oftenLike Trumpets to their angers : we are ruin 'd , Our services turn 'd to disgraces , mischiefs ; Our brave old General , like one had pilfer 'd , Tortur 'd , and whipt : the Colonels eyes , like torches , Blaze every where and fright fair peace .
Yet worse , Sir ; The news is currant now , they mean to leave ye , Leave their Allegiance ; and under Olins ChargeThe bloody Enemy march straight against ye .
I have heard this too , Sir .
This must be prevented , And suddenly , and warily .
'T is time , Sir , But what to minister , or how ?
Go in with me , And there we 'll think upo n't : such blows as these , Equal defences ask , else they displease. [ Exeunt.SCENE II .
Petesca , and Gentlewoman .
Lord , what a coil has here been with these Souldiers ! They are cruel fellows .
And yet methought we found 'emHandsome enough ; I 'll tell thee true , Petesca , I lookt for other manner of dealings from 'em , And had prepar 'd my self ; but where 's my Lady ?
In her old dumps within : monstrous melancholy ; Sure she was mad of this Wench .
And she had been a man , She would have been a great deal madder , I am glad she is shifted .
'T was a wicked thing for me to betray her , And yet I must confess she stood in our lights .
Alinda.What young thing 's this ?
Good morrow beauteous Gentlewomen : 'Pray ye is the Princess stirring yet ?
He has her face .
Her very tongue , and tone too : her youth upon him .
I guess ye to be the Princess Women .
Yes , we are , Sir .
Pray is there not a Gentlewoman waiting on her Grace , Ye call Alinda ?
The Devil sure in her shape .
I have heard her tell my Lady of a Brother , An only Brother that she had : in travel --
'Mass , I remember that : this may be he too : I would this thing would serve her .
Olympia .
So would I Wench , We should love him better sure : Sir , here 's the Princess , She best can satisfie ye .
How I love that presence ! O blessed Eyes , how nobly shine your comforts !
What Gentleman is that ?
We know not , Madam : He ask 'd us for your Grace : and as we guess it , He is Alinda 's Brother .
Ha ! let me mark him : My grief has almost blinded me : her Brother ? By Venus , he has all her sweetness upon him : Two silver drops of dew were never liker .
Gracious Lady --
That pleasant pipe he has too .
Being my happiness to pass by this way , And having as I understand by Letters , A Sister in your vertuous service , Madam --
O now my heart , my heart akes .
All the comfortMy poor youth has , all that my hopes have built me , I thought it my first duty , my best service , Here to arrive first , humbly to thank your GraceFor my poor Sister , humbly to thank your Nobleness , That bounteous Goodness in ye .
'T is he certainly .
That spring of favour to her ; with my life , Madam , If any such most happy means might meet me , To shew my thankfulness .
What have I done , Fool !
She came a stranger to your Grace , no Courtier ; Nor of that curious breed befits your service , Yet one I dare assure my Soul , that lov 'd yeBefore she saw ye ; doted on your Vertues ; Before she knew those fair eyes , long 'd to read 'em , You only had her prayers , you her wishes ; And that one hope to be yours once , preserv 'd her .
I have done wickedly .
A little Beauty , Such as a Cottage breeds , she brought along with her ; And yet our Country-eyes esteem 'd it much too : But for her beauteous mind , forget great Lady , I am her Brother , and let me speak a stranger , Since she was able to beget a thought , 't was honest.The daily study how to fit your services , Truly to tread that vertuous path you walk in , So fir 'd her honest Soul , we thought her Sainted ; I presume she is still the same : I would fain see her , For Madam , 't is no little love I owe her .
Sir , such a maid there was , I had --
There was , Madam ?
O my poor Wench : eyes , I will ever curse yeFor your Credulity , Alinda .
That 's her name , Madam .
Give me a little leave , Sir , to lament her .
Is she dead , Lady ?
Dead , Sir , to my service.She is gone , pray ye ask no further .
I obey Madam : Gone ? now must I lament too : said ye gone Madam ?
Gone , gone for ever .
That 's a cruel saying : Her honour too ?
Prithee look angry on me , And if thou ever lovedst her , spit upon me ; Do something like a Brother , like a friend , And do not only say thou lov'st her --
Ye amaze me .
I ruin 'd her , I wrong 'd her , I abus 'd her ; Poor innocent soul , I flung her ; sweet Alinda , Thou vertuous maid , my soul now calls thee vertuous.Why do ye not rail now at me ?
For what Lady ?
Call me base treacherous woman .
Heaven defend me .
Rashly I thought her false , and put her from me , Rashly , and madly I betrai 'd her modesty , Put her to wander , heaven knows where : nay , more Sir , Stuck a black brand upon her .
'T was not well Lady .
'T was damnable : she loving me so dearly , Never poor wench lov 'd so : Sir believe me , 'T was the most dutious wench , the best companion , When I was pleas 'd , the happiest , and the gladdest , The modestest sweet nature dwelt within her : I saw all this , I knew all this , I lov 'd it , I doated on it too , and yet I kill 'd it : O what have I forsaken ? what have I lost ?
Madam , I'le take my leave , since she is wandring , 'T is fit I know no rest .
Will you go too Sir ? I have not wrong 'd you yet , if you dare trust me , For yet I love Alinda there , I honour her , I love to look upon those eyes that speak her , To read that face again , ( modesty keep me , )
, in that shape : but why should you trust me , 'T was I betray 'd your Sister , I undid her ; And believe me , gentle youth , 't is I weep for her : Appoint what penance you please : but stay then , And see me perform it : ask what honour this placeIs able to heap on ye , or what wealth : If following me will like ye , my care of ye , Which for your sisters sake , for your own goodness --
Not all the honour earth has , now she 's gone Lady , Not all the favour ; yet if I sought preferment , Under your bounteous Grace I would only take it.Peace rest upon ye : one sad tear every dayFor poor Alindas. sake , 't is fit ye pay. [ Exit .
A thousand noble youth , and when I sleep , Even in my silver slumbers still I'le weep. [ Exit.SCENA III .
Duke , and Gentlemen .
Have ye been with 'em ?
Yes , and't please your Grace , But no perswasion serves 'em , nor no promise , They are fearfull angry , and by this time Sir , Upon their march to the Enemy .
They must be stopt .
Burris .
I , but what force is able ? and what leader --
How now , have you been with Archas ?
Yes , and't please ye , And told him all : he frets like a chaf 'd Lyon , And calls for his Arms : and all those honest CourtiersThat dare draw Swords .
Is he able to do any thing ?
His mind is well enough ; and where his charge is , Let him be ne 're so sore , 't is a full Army .
Who commands the Rebels ?
The young Colonel , That makes the old man almost mad : he swears Sir , He will not spare his Sons head for the Dukedom .
Is the Court in Arms ?
As fast as they can bustle , Every man mad to goe now : inspir 'd strangely , As if they were to force the Enemy , I beseech your Grace to give me leave .
Pray go Sir , And look to the old man well ; take up all fairly , And let no bloud be spilt ; take general pardons , And quench this fury with fair peace .
I shall Sir , Or seal it with my service ; they are villains : The Court is up : good Sir , go strengthen 'em , Your Royal sight will make 'em scorn all dangers ; The General needs no proof .
Come let 's go view 'em. [ Exeunt.SCENA IV .
Theodore , Putskie , Ancient , Souldiers , Drums,
'T is known we are up , and marching : no submission , No promise of base peace can cure our maladies , We have suffer 'd beyond all repair of honour : Your valiant old man 's whipt ; whipt Gentlemen , Whipt like a slave : that flesh that never trembled , Nor shrunk one sinew at a thousand charges , That noble body rib 'd in arms , the EnemySo often shook at , and then shun 'd like thunder , That body 's torn with lashes .
Let 's turn head .
Turn nothing Gentlemen , let 's march on fairly , Unless they charge us .
Think still of his abuses , And keep your angers .
He was whipt like a top , I never saw a whore so lac 'd : Court school-butter ? Is this their diet ? I'le dress 'em one running banquet : What Oracle can alter us ? did not we see him ? See him we lov 'd ?
And though we did obey him , Forc 'd by his reverence for that time ; is't fit Gentlemen ? My noble friends , is't fit we men , and Souldiers , Live to endure this , and look on too ?
Forward : They may call back the Sun as soon , stay time , Prescribe a Law to death , as we endure this .
They will make ye all fair promises .
We care not .
Use all their arts upon ye .
Hang all their arts .
And happily they'l bring him with 'em .
March apace then , He is old and can not overtake us .
Say he doe .
We'l run away with him : they shall never see him more : The truth is , we'l hear nothing , stop at nothing , Consider nothing but our way ; believe nothing , Not though they say their prayers : be content with nothing , But the knocking out their brains : and last , do nothingBut ban 'em and curse 'em , till we come to kill 'em .
Remove then forwards bravely ; keep your minds whole , And the next time we face 'em , shall be fatal. [ Exeunt.SCENA V .
Archas , Duke , Burris , Gent , and Sould .
Peace to your Grace ; take rest Sir , they are before us .
They are Sir , and upon the march. [ Exit Duke .
Lord Burris , Take you those horse and coast 'em : upon the first advantage , If they will not slake their march , charge 'em up roundly , By that time I'le come in .
I'le do it truly. [ Exit .
How do you feel your self Sir ?
Well , I thank ye ; A little weak , but anger shall supply that ; You will all stand bravely to it ?
Whilst we have lives Sir .
Ye speak like Gentlemen ; I'le make the knaves know , The proudest , and the strongest hearted Rebel , They have a law to live in , and they shall have ; Beat up a pace , by this time he is upon 'em , [ Drum within.And sword , but hold me now , thou shalt play ever. [ Exeunt .

Here comes Lord Burris Sir , I think to parly .
You are welcom noble Sir , I hope to our part .
No , valiant Colonel , I am come to chide ye , To pity ye ; to kill ye , if these fail me ; Fie , what dishonour seek ye ! what black infamy ! Why do ye draw out thus ? draw all shame with ye ? Are these fit cares in subjects ? I command yeLay down your arms again , move in that peace , That fair obedience you were bred in .
Charge us : We come not here to argue .
Charge up bravely , And hotly too , we have hot spleens to meet ye , Hot as the shames are offer 'd us .
Archas , Gent. and Souldiers .
Look behind ye.Do you see that old man ? do you know him Souldiers ?
Your Father Sir , believe me --
You know his marches , You have seen his executions : is it yet peace ?
We'l dye here first .
Farewel : you'l hear on 's presently .
Stay Burris : this is too poor , too beggerly a bodyTo bear the honour of a charge from me , A sort of tatter 'd Rebels ; go provide Gallowses ; Ye are troubled with hot heads , I'le cool ye presently : These look like men that were my SouldiersNow I behold 'em nearly , and more narrowly , My honest friends : where got they these fair figures ? Where did they steal these shapes ?
They are struck already .
Do you see that fellow there , that goodly Rebel ? He looks as like a Captain I lov 'd tenderly : A fellow of a faith indeed .
He has sham 'd him .
And that that bears the Colours there , most certainSo like an Ancient of mine own , a brave fellow , A loving and obedient , that believe me Burris , I am amaz 'd and troubled : and were it notI know the general goodness of my people , The duty , and the truth , the stedfast honestie , And am assur 'd they would as soon turn DevilsAs rebels to allegeance , for mine honour .
Here needs no wars .
I pray forgive us Sir .
Good General forgive us , or use your sword , Your words are double death .
Good noble General .
Pray Sir be mercifull .
Weep out your shames first , Ye make me fool for companie : fie Souldiers , My Souldiers too , and play these tricks ? what 's he there ? Sure I have seen his face too ; yes , most certainI have a son , but I hope he is not here now , 'Would much resemble this man , wondrous near him , Just of his height and making too , you seem a Leader .
Good Sir , do not shame me more : I know your anger , And less than death I look not for .
You shall be my charge Sir , it seems you want foes , When you would make your friends your Enemies.A running bloud ye have , but I shall cure ye .
Good Sir --
No more good Lord : beat forward Souldiers : And you , march in the rear , you have lost your places. [ Exeunt.SCENA VI .
, Olympia , Honora , Viola .
You shall not be thus sullen still with me Sister , You do the most unnobly to be angry , For as I have a soul , I never touch 'd her , I never yet knew one unchast thought in her : I must confess , I lov 'd her : as who would not ? I must confess I doated on her strangely , I offer 'd all , yet so strong was her honour , So fortifi 'd as fair , no hope could reach her , And whilst the world beheld this , and confirm 'd it , Why would you be so jealous ?
Good Sir pardon me , I feel sufficiently my follies penance , And am asham 'd , that shame a thousand sorrowsFeed on continually , would I had never seen her , Or with a clearer judgement look 'd upon her , She was too good for me , so heavenly good Sir , Nothing but Heaven can love that soul sufficiently , Where I shall see her once again .
Burris .
No more tears , If she be within the Dukedom , we'l recover her : Welcom Lord Burris , fair news I hope .
Most fair Sir , Without one drop of bloud these wars are ended , The Souldier cool 'd again , indeed asham 'd Sir , And all his anger ended .
Where 's Lord Archas ?
Not far off Sir : with him his valiant son , Head of this fire , but now a prisoner , And if by your sweet mercy not prevented , I fear some fatal stroke. [ Drums .
Archas , Theodore , Gentlemen , Souldiers .
I hear the Drums beat , Welcom , my worthy friend .
Stand where ye are Sir , Even as you love your country , move not forward , Nor plead for peace till I have done a justice , A justice on this villain ; none of mine now , A justice on this Rebel .
O my Brother .
This fatal firebrand --
Forget not old man , He is thy son , of thine own bloud .
In these veinsNo treacherie e 're harbour 'd yet , no mutinie , I ne 're gave life to lewd and headstrong Rebels .
'T is his first fault .
Not of a thousand Sir , Or were it so , it is a fault so mightie , So strong against the nature of all mercy , His Mother were she living , would not weep for him , He dare not say he would live .
I must not Sir , Whilst you say 't is not fit : your Graces mercyNot to my life appli 'd , but to my fault Sir , The worlds forgiveness next , last , on my knees Sir , I humbly beg , Do not take from me yet the name of Father , Strike me a thousand blows , but let me dye yours .
He moves my heart : I must be suddain with him , I shall grow faint else in my execution ; Come , come Sir , you have seen death ; now meet him bravely .
Hold , hold I say , a little hold , considerThou hast no more sons Archas to inherit thee .
Yes Sir , I have another , and a nobler : No treason shall inherit me : young ArchasA boy , as sweet as young , my Brother breeds him , My noble Brother Briskie breeds him nobly , Him let your favour find : give him your honour .
Putskie ( alias Briskie ) and Alinda , ( alias Archas . )
Thou hast no child left Archas , none to inherit theeIf thou strikst that stroke now : behold young Archas ; Behold thy Brother here , thou bloudy Brother , As bloody to this sacrifice as thou art : Heave up thy sword , and mine 's heav 'd up : strike Archas , And I'le strike too as suddenly , as deadly : Have mercy , and I'le have mercy : the Duke gives it.Look upon all these , how they weep it from thee , Choose quickly , and begin .
On your obedience , On your allegeance save him .
Take him to ye , [ Soul. shout.And sirrah , be an honest man , ye have reason : I thank ye worthy Brother : welcom child , Mine own sweet child .
Why was this boy conceal 'd thus ?
Your graces pardon : Fearing the vow you made against my Brother , And that your anger would not only lightOn him , but find out all his familie , This young boy , to preserve from after danger , Like a young wench , hither I brought ; my selfIn the habit of an ordinarie CaptainDisguis 'd , got entertainment , and serv 'd hereThat I might still be ready to all fortunes : That boy your Grace took , nobly entertain 'd him , But thought a Girle , Alinda , Madam .
Stand away , And let me look upon him .
My young Mistris ? This is a strange metamorphosis , Alinda ?
Your graces humble servant .
Come hither Sister : I dare yet scarce believe mine eyes : how they view one another ? Dost thou not love this boy well ?
I should lye else , Trust me , extreamly lye Sir .
Didst thou never wish Olympia , It might be thus ?
A thousand times .
Here take him : Nay , do not blush : I do not jest ; kiss sweetly : Boy , ye kiss faintly boy ; Heaven give ye comfort ; Teach him , he'l quickly learn : there 's two hearts eas 'd now .
You do me too much honour Sir .
No Archas , But all I can , I will ; can you love me ? speak truly .
Yes Sir , dearly .
Come hither Viola , can you love this man ?
I'le do the best I can Sir .
Seal it Burris , We'l all to Church together instantly : And then a vie for boyes ; stay , bring Boroskie .
Boroskie.I had almost forgot that lump of mischief.There Archas , take the enemie to honour , The knave to worth : do with him what thou wilt .
Then to my sword again ; you to your prayers ; Wash off your villanies , you feel the burthen .
Forgive me e 're I die , most honest Archas ; 'T is too much honour that I perish thus ; O strike my faults to kill them , that no memorie , No black and blasted infamy hereafter -- --
Come , are ye ready ?
Yes .
And truly penitent , to make your way straight ?
Thus I wash off my sins .
Stand up , and live then , And live an honest man ; I scorn mens ruines : Take him again , Sir , trie him : and believeThis thing will be a perfect man .
I take him .
And when I fail those hopes , heavens hopes fail me .
You are old : no more wars Father:
take you the charge , be General .
All good bless ye .
Why that ye wo't of,
The turne the good turne ?
Any turne the Roche turne ;
