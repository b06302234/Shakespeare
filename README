python/crawl_{plays|sonnets}.py
crawls the nfs.sparknotes.com website and downloads html

python/scrapper_soupparser.py
extracts original and modern english sentences from the HTML

scripts/extract_lines.sh
runs scrapper_soupparser.py on all the HTML files and puts output into format suitable for sentence alignment (in data/plays/align)

data/plays/align
Contains the aligned sentences at the level of HTML pages

data/plays/align/merged
All sentences merged together into plays.
The bilingual sentence aligner doesn't really seem to work with very small files (e.g. the HTML pages).  Presumably
it should be possible to do a better job with the smaller files, since they are more tightly aligned, but I don't
think this is the type of data the sentence aligner was designed for.
Anyway, it seems to work fine on the merged plays.  Out of 31,718 original lines the sentence aligner finds 21,079
alignments.  It may be possible to improve on this...
Also note: in the merged plays the pages are in random order.  I think this probably shouldn't make much difference,
but might be worth fixing...

data/align/plays/model_16plays
Moses model trained on 16 plays (except R&J), following the instructions on http://www.statmt.org/moses_steps.html
  moses.ini
  moses-bin.ini
The two above use same parameters but provide different outputs (?)
  ./tuning/ 
I put R&J over there, planning to split into dev and test.
