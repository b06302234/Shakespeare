I am sorry that you will leave my father like this: Our house is hell, and you, a happy devil, Robbed it of some taste of boredom.
Tears exhibit my voice.
Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew!
If a Christian doesnâ€™t play the rogue and get you, I am much deceived.
But, goodbye!
these foolish drops drown my manly spirit somewhat; goodbye!
Goodbye, good Launcelot.
If you keep your promise, I shall end this strife, Become a Christian and your loving wife.
