But who asked you to join us?
Macbeth.
Then stand with us.
Listen!
I hear horses.
Give us a light there, hello!
Then it is he; the rest That are nobles Are already in the court.
He is cooling off his horses.
A light, a light!
It is he.
Letâ€™s do it.
There will be rain tonight.
Let it come down.
O, treachery!
Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
O slave!
Who put out the light?
We have lost best half of our attack.
Well, let's go, and tell Macbeth how much we did.
