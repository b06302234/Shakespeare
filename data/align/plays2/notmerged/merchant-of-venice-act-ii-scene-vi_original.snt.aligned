Where is the horse that doth untread again, His tedious measures with the unbated fire, That he did pace them first?

How like a younger, or a prodigal, The scarfed bark puts from her native bay, Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
How like a prodigal doth she return; With over-weather'd ribs, and ragged sails, Lean, rent, and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!

Who's there?
Signior Antonio!
where are all the rest?
I am glad on't; I desire no more delight, Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
