It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that on certain news now arrived, concerning the mere total destruction of the Turkish fleet, every man rejoice, some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to whatever sport and revels his disposition leads him, because, besides this good news, it is the celebration of his wedding.
His pleasure should be proclaimed this much.
All offices are open, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five until the clock rings eleven.
Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!
