Find the Jew's house, give him this deed, And let him sign it; we'll leave tonight, And be a day ahead of our husbands coming home.
This deed will be very welcome to Lorenzo.
My Lord Bassanio, listening to more advice, Has sent you this ring here, and asks Your company at dinner.
I can’t do that: I accept his ring most thankfully; And please tell him so; furthermore, Please show my youth to old Shylock's house.
That I will do.
Away!
Hurry: you know where I’ll wait for you.
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
