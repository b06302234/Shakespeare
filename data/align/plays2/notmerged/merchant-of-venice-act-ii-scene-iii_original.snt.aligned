I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so; Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness: But fare thee well: there is a ducat for thee.
Adieu!—tears exhibit my tongue.
Most beautiful pagan,—most sweet Jew!
If a Christian did not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.
But, adieu!
these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit: adieu!
Farewell, good Launcelot.
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife; Become a Christian, and thy loving wife.
