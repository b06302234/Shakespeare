Now old desire lies in his deathbed, And young affection is longing to be his heir; That beauty for which love groaned and would die, With tender Juliet matched now isnâ€™t beautiful.
Now Romeo is beloved, and loves again, Both of them bewitched by the charm of looks; But he must complain to his supposed enemy, And she must steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
