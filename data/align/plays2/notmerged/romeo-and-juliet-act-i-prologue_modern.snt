Now old desire lies in his deathbed, And young affection is longing to be his heir; That beauty for which love groaned and would die, With tender Juliet matched now isnâ€™t beautiful.
Now Romeo is beloved, and loves again, Both of them bewitched by the charm of looks; But he must complain to his supposed enemy, And she must steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
Because he is thought to be an enemy, he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers used to swear; And she, as much in love with him, has fewer chances To meet her new beloved anywhere.
But passion lends them power, and time the means, to meet, Tempering the two people at opposite ends with extreme sweetness.
