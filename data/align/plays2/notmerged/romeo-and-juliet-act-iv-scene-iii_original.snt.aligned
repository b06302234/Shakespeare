What, are you busy, ho?
Need you my help?
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries As are behoveful for our state to-morrow.
So please you, let me now be left alone, And let the nurse this night sit up with you; For I am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business.
Good night.
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
Farewell!
God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life.
I'll call them back again to comfort me.
Nurse!â€” What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, No!
This shall forbid it.
Lie thou there.
What if it be a poison which the friar Subtly hath ministr'd to have me dead, Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd Because he married me before to Romeo?
I will not entertain so bad a thought.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb, I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me?
There's a fearful point!
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
O, look!
methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point.
Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come!
this do I drink to thee.
