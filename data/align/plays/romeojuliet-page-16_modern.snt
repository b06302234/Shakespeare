Your servants were fighting your enemy’s servants before I got here.
I drew my sword to part them.
Right then, that hothead Tybalt showed up with his sword ready.
He taunted me and waved his sword around, making the air hiss.
As we were trading blows, more and more people showed up to join the fight, until the Prince came and broke everyone up.
Oh, where’s Romeo?
Have you seen him today?
I’m glad he wasn’t here for this fight.
Madam, I had a lot on my mind an hour before dawn this morning, so I went for a walk.
Underneath the Sycamore grove that grows on the west side of the city, I saw your son taking an early-morning walk.
I headed toward him, but he saw me coming and hid in the woods.
I thought he must be feeling the same way I was—wanting to be alone and tired of his own company.
I figured he was avoiding me, and I was perfectly happy to leave him alone and keep to myself.
He’s been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs.
But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes home to escape the light.
