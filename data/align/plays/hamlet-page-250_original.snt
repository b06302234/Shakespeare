A document in madness.
Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
There’s fennel for you, and columbines.—There’s rue for you, and here’s some for me.
We may call it “herb of grace” o' Sundays.—Oh, you must wear your rue with a difference.—There’s a daisy.
I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died.
They say he made a good end  Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself, She turns to favor and to prettiness.
And of all Christian souls, I pray God.
God be wi' ye.
Do you see this, O God?
Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right.
Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me.
If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touched, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours, To you in satisfaction.
But if not, Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labor with your soul To give it due content.
