Listen up, you slave.
Are you going to let us in?
Come, help me bang on the door, master.
Well done!
We answered them, blow for blow.
You good-for-nothing, let me in.
Master, knock hard upon the door.
If I break the door down, slave, youâ€™ll be sorry for this.
Is that you, wife?
You could have come sooner.
