By this hand, I am.
Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey what I will set down to my lady.
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.
I will help you to ’t.
But tell me true, are you not mad indeed?
Or do you but counterfeit?
Believe me, I am not.
I tell thee true.
Nay, I’ll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.
I will fetch you light, and paper, and ink.
Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree.
I prithee, be gone.
