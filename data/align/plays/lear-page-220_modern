She didn’t ask anything?
Actually, once or twice she sighed and said, “father,” as if the word were pressing on her chest.
Once she exclaimed, “Sisters, sisters, shame on you!
Kent, father, sisters!
What, out in a storm in the middle of the night?
I can’t believe it.” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water.
Then she ran away to grieve alone.
It must be fate that makes us who we are—otherwise someone as good as Cordelia could not possibly be related to those two witches.

No, afterward.
Well, sir, poor delirious Lear is in town.
Sometimes when he’s lucid he remembers why we’re here, and absolutely refuses to see his daughter.
Why, good sir?
He’s too overwhelmed with shame.
He remembers how unkind he was to her, how he disowned her and sent her abroad, how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters.
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia.
