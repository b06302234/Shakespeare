You’re both those people—responsible for both cause and effect.
Your beauty caused what I did.
It haunted me in my sleep.
I would have killed the whole world just to be able spend one hour next to you.
If I believed you, murderer, I would take my nails and scratch that beauty right off my cheeks.
I couldn’t stand to see you destroy your beauty; you won’t touch it as long as I’m standing next to you.
Just as everyone becomes cheerful from the sun, I’m cheered up by your looks.
They are my daylight, my life.
Then I hope night shadows your day, and death takes your life!
Don’t damn yourself.
You, fair lady, are both my day and my life.
I wish I were, so I could deprive you of both day and life.
It’s strange that you want to take revenge on the person who loves you.
It’s just and reasonable that I want to take revenge on the person who killed my husband.
The man who killed your husband, dear lady, only did it to help you get a better husband.
There is no better one on earth.
