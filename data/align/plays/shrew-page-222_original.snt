You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir.
Pray, what do you think is his name?
His name!
As if I knew not his name!
I have brought him up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
Lucentio!
Oh, he hath murdered his master!
Lay hold on him, I charge you in the Duke’s name.
O my son, my son!
Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
Carry this mad knave to the jail.—Father Baptista, I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
Carry me to the jail?
Stay, officer.
He shall not go to prison.
Talk not, Signior Gremio.
I say he shall go to prison.
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched in this business.
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.
