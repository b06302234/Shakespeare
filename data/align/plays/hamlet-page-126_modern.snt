That’s good.
The muffled queen” is good.
Look how flushed the actor is, with tears in his eyes.
All right, that’s enough, please.
My lord, I will give them all they deserve.
Good heavens, man, give them more than that!
If you pay everyone what they deserve, would anyone ever escape a whipping?
Treat them with honor and dignity.
The less they deserve, the more your generosity is worth.
Lead them inside.
