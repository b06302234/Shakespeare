I know his gait, ’tis he.—Villain, thou diest!
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed But that my coat is better than thou know’st I will make proof of thine.
Oh, I am slain!
I am maimed for ever.
Help, ho!
Murder!
Murder!
The voice of Cassio.
Iago keeps his word.
Oh, villain that I am!
It is even so.
Oh, help, ho!
Light!
A surgeon!
Tis he.
Oh, brave Iago, honest and just, That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong!
