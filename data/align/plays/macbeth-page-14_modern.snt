Speak, if you can.
What kind of creatures are you?
All hail, Macbeth!
Hail to you, thane of Glamis!
All hail, Macbeth!
Hail to you, thane of Cawdor!
All hail, Macbeth, the future king!
My dear Macbeth, why do you look so startled and afraid of these nice things theyâ€™re saying?
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater.
You are not as happy as Macbeth, yet much happier.
Your descendants will be kings, even though you will not be one.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
