Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house.
Three parts of him Is ours already, and the man entire Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
Oh, he sits high in all the peopleâ€™s hearts, And that which would appear offense in us, His countenance, like richest alchemy, Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited.
Let us go, For it is after midnight, and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him.
