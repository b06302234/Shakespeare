There is a litter ready.
Lay him in ’t And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet Both welcome and protection.
Take up thy master.
If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life, With thine and all that offer to defend him, Stand in assurèd loss.
Take up, take up, And follow me, that will to some provision Give thee quick conduct.
Oppressèd nature sleeps.— This rest might yet have balmed thy broken sinews, Which, if convenience will not allow, Stand in hard cure.
Come, help to bear thy master.
Thou must not stay behind.
Come, come, away.
When we our betters see bearing our woes, We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Who alone suffers, suffers most i' th' mind, Leaving free things and happy shows behind.
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship.
How light and portable my pain seems now When that which makes me bend makes the king bow.
He childed as I fathered.
Tom, away!
Mark the high noises and thyself bewray When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee, In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.
What will hap more tonight, safe ’scape the king!
Lurk, lurk.
