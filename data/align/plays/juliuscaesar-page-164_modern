Brutus, your sober expression is a mask to hide the fact that you’ve wronged me.
And when you do— Cassius, calm down.
We know each other well, and you can speak your grievances quietly.
Let’s not argue here in front of both our armies, which ought to see nothing but love between us.
Order them to move back.
Then, in my tent, you can elaborate on your complaints, and I’ll listen.
Pindarus, order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground.
Lucillius, you do the same, and don’t allow anyone to come into our tent until we’ve finished our conference.
Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door.
