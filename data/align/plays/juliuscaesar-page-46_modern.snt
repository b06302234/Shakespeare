Come on, Casca, you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise.
He’s three-quarters on our side already, and we’ll win him over entirely at this meeting.
Oh, the people love him well.
Things that would look bad if we did them, Brutus could do and look virtuous—just like an alchemist turns worthless tin to gold.
Yes, you’re absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him.
Let’s go, because it’s already after midnight, and we want him on our side before daylight.
