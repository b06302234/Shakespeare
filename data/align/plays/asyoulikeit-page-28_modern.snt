You’re going to have to, if you stay here.
This is the place they’re scheduled to wrestle, and they’re ready to go.
Yes, I see them coming.
Let’s stay and watch.
Come on.
Since the youth won’t be reasoned with, he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness.
Is that the man?
That’s him, madam.
Alas, he is too young.
Yet he seems capable.
What’s up, daughter and niece?
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling?
Yes, my lord, if you give us permission.
You won’t enjoy it much, I can tell you, the odds are so against this young man.
Because he’s so young, I’ve tried to discourage him, but he won’t listen.
Talk to him, ladies.
See if you can persuade him.
Call him over here, good Monsieur Le Beau.
Go ahead.
I’ll make myself scarce.
