And so have I a noble father lost, A sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections.
But my revenge will come.
Break not your sleeps for that.
You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime.
You shortly shall hear more.
I loved your father, and we love ourself.
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine— How now, what news?
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.
This to your majesty, this to the queen.
From Hamlet?
Who brought them?
Sailors, my lord, they say.
I saw them not.
They were given me by Claudio.
He received them Of him that brought them.
Laertes, you shall hear them.—Leave us.
High and mighty,  You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.
Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes, when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
Hamlet.”
