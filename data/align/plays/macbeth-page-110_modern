It’s nice of you to remind me.
Why don’t you have a seat, your highness?
We would have all the nobility of Scotland gathered under one roof, if only Banquo were here.
I hope it turns out that he’s late out of rudeness, and not because something bad has happened to him.
His absence means he’s broken his promise, sir.
If it pleases you, your highness, why don’t you sit with us and grace us with your royal company?
The table’s full.
Here’s an empty seat, sir.
Where?
What, my good lord?
