Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore.
We should all kneel before her, men of Cyprus!
Greetings, my lady, and may God always be with you.
Thank you, brave Cassio.
Is there any news about my husband?
He hasn’t arrived yet.
As far as I know, he’s okay and will arrive here soon.
Oh, but I’m worried.
How did you two get separated?
The storm separated us.
Listen, they’ve spotted another ship!
They fired a greeting shot too, so this is also a friendly ship.
Go find out the news.
Ensign Iago, welcome.—And welcome to you, too, madam.
