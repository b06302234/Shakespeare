We’re close enough now.
Throw down these branches and show them who you really are.
Uncle Siward, you and your son will lead the first battle.
Brave Macduff and I will do the rest, according to our battle plan.
Good luck.
If we meet Macbeth’s army tonight, let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
Blow all the trumpets.
They loudly announce the news of blood and death.
