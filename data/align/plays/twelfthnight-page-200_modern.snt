Poor man, how did you go insane?
Fool, no one has ever been as mistreated as I am.
I’m completely sane, Fool.
I’m as sane as you are.
As sane as me?
Then you really are insane, if you’re no saner than a fool.
They treat me like garbage here.
They keep me in darkness, and send idiotic priests to talk to me—those asses!—and do everything they can to insist I’m insane.
Be careful what you say—the priest is here.
Sir Topas!
Fool, fool, hey, fool!
Please, sir, be quiet.
What do you want to say, sir?
I’ve just been scolded for speaking to you.
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper.
I tell you, I’m as sane as any man in Illyria.
If only you were, sir.
