Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace.
And like Limander am I trusty still.
And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
Oh, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
I kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all.
Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?
Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.
Thus have I, Wall, my part dischargèd so.
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
