Flatter my sorrow with report of it.
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honor, Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
Even all I have— ay, and myself and all— Will I withal endow a child of thine; So in the Lethe of thy angry soul Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.
My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul.
What do you think?
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul.
So from thy soul’s love didst thou love her brothers, And from my heart’s love I do thank thee for it.
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter And do intend to make her Queen of England.
Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
Even he that makes her queen.
Who else should be?
What, thou?
Even so.
How think you of it?
