Is Banquo gone from court?
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
Say to the king I would attend his leisure For a few words.

Naught’s had, all’s spent, Where our desire is got without content.
Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.

She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly.
Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy.
Duncan is in his grave.
After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.
Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing Can touch him further.
