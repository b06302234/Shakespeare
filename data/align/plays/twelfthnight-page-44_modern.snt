Tell him he’s not going to speak with me.
I told him that.
He says he’ll stand at your door like a signpost or a bench until he speaks with you.
What kind of man is he?
Just a man, like any other.
But what’s he like?
He’s very rude.
He insists he’ll speak with you whether you want him to or not.
What does he look like?
How old is he?
Not old enough to be a man, but not young enough to be a boy.
He’s like a bud before it becomes a pea pod, or like a little green apple before it gets big and ripe.
He’s somewhere between boy and man.
He’s very handsome and speaks well, but he’s very young.
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding.
Show him in.
Call in my maid.
Maria, our lady wants you.
Give me my veil.
Come, put it over my face.
