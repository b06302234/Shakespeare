Have I lived this long only to be the butt of a joke whenever you’re angry or frustrated?
When I said that, I was angry too.
You admit it, then?
Give me your hand.
And my heart too.
Oh, Brutus!
What’s the matter?
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper, which I inherited from my mother, makes me forget how I should behave?
Yes, Cassius.
And from now on, when you get hot with me, I’ll assume it’s your mother speaking and leave it at that.
