What blessed work, my king.
If there’s anyone among this princely group who mistakes me for an enemy—if by accident or in anger I have done anything to offend you—I want to join with you in peaceful friendship.
It kills me to be enemies with you.
I hate it and want all good men’s love.
Today shall always be remembered as a holy day.
If only all struggles ended this well.
One more thing, my dear majesty.
Please pardon our brother Clarence.
Why, madam, have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king?
Who doesn’t know that the good duke is dead?
You do him wrong to laugh at his corpse.
