If it’s me, there’s no time as good as this hour of Caesar’s death, and no weapon better than your swords, covered with the noblest blood in the world.
I ask you, if you have a grudge against me, to kill me now, while your stained hands still reek of blood.
I could live a thousand years and I wouldn’t be as ready to die as I am now.
There’s no place I’d rather die than here by Caesar, and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you, the masters of this new era.
Oh, Antony, don’t beg us to kill you.
Though we seem bloody and cruel right now, with our bloody hands and this deed we’ve done, you’ve only seen our hands and their bloody business; you haven’t looked into our hearts.
They are full of pity for Caesar.
But a stronger pity, for the wrongs committed against Rome, drove out our pity for Caesar, as fire drives out fire, and so we killed him.
For you, our swords have blunt edges, too dull to harm you, Mark Antony.
Our arms, which can be strong and cruel, and our hearts, filled with brotherly love, embrace you with kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
Your vote will be as strong as anyone’s in the reordering of the government.
But just be patient until we’ve calmed the masses, who are beside themselves with fear.
Then we’ll explain to you why I, who loved Caesar even while I stabbed him, have taken this course of action.
