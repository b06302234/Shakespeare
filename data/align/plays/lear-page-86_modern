Father is on the lookout.
Get out of here quickly!
It has leaked out that you’re hiding here.
If you leave now, you can take advantage of the darkness and sneak away.
You haven’t said anything against the Duke of Cornwall, have you?
He’s rushing on his way here right now, and Regan’s with him.
Have you said anything against Cornwall or Albany?
Think about it.
I’m sure of it.
I haven’t said a word.
I hear my father coming.
Forgive me.
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword.
Draw your sword too, as if you’re defending yourself.
Be convincing.
If I had some blood on me it would look like I’d fought more fiercely.
Edmund, where’s your wicked brother?
