I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree.
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout, waiting to capture me.
But I’ll survive while I can.
I’ve decided to disguise myself as the lowliest and rattiest beggar that mankind has ever seen.
I’ll smear my face with filth, put on a loincloth, make my hair matted and tangled, and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing.
I’ve seen beggars out of insane asylums who stick pins and nails into their numb arms.
They pray or roar lunatic curses, horrifying farmers and villagers into giving them alms.
Poor crazy Tom!” they call themselves.
Well, at least that’s something.
As Edgar, I’m nothing at all.
