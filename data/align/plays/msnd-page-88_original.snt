The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me.
Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia?
I’ll believe as soon This whole Earth may be bored, and that the moon May through the center creep and so displease Her brother’s noontide with th' Antipodes.
It cannot be but thou hast murdered him.
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
So should the murdered look, and so should I, Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty.
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear, As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
What’s this to my Lysander?
Where is he?
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
Out, dog!
Out, cur!
Thou drivest me past the bounds Of maiden’s patience.
Hast thou slain him then?
Henceforth be never numbered among men!
Oh, once tell true, tell true even for my sake— Durst thou have looked upon him being awake, And hast thou killed him sleeping?
O brave touch!
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
An adder did it, for with doubler tongue Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
You spend your passion on a misprised mood.
I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood.
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
An if I could, what should I get therefore?
