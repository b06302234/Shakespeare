Good Queen, let us entreat you— O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this, That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me, Doing the honor of thy lordliness To one so meek, that mine own servant should Parcel the sum of my disgraces by Addition of his envy!
Say, good Caesar, That I some lady trifles have reserved, Immoment toys, things of such dignity As we greet modern friends withal, and say Some nobler token I have kept apart For Livia and Octavia, to induce Their mediation, must I be unfolded With one that I have bred?
The gods!
It smites me Beneath the fall I have.
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirit Through th’ ashes of my chance.
Wert thou a man, Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
Forbear, Seleucus.
Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought For things that others do, and when we fall We answer others’ merits in our name, Are therefore to be pitied.
