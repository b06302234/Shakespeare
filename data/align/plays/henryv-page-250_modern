Peace to this occasion that’s brought us all together.
Health and good day to our brother the king of France and to our sister the queen.
Joy and good wishes to our lovely royal cousin, Katherine.
And you, Duke of Burgundy, who brought this great assembly together, we salute you as descendent and member of this royal family.
And a health to all you lords and princes of France.
We rejoice to see you, most worthy brother of England.
You are welcome here, as are all of you English princes.
Brother of England, may this meeting prove as fruitful as it is joyous.
We are glad to look upon your face—a face whose eyes have until now carried in them a glance as deadly, for any Frenchman they alighted on, as the poisonous eyes of those mythical lizards, the basilisks.
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship.
We’re here to say “amen” to that.
All you English princes, I salute you.
