Cupid—that blind bastard son of Venus, conceived from a thought and anger, born from insanity, that blind, naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself—let Cupid judge how deep my love runs.
I’m telling you, Aliena, I can’t stand being apart from Orlando.
I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns.
And I’m going to sleep.
