I never saw him like this before.
There must be some magic in that handkerchief.
I’m miserable that I lost it.
Men are all the same, but it takes longer than a year or two to see how bad they are.
They’re like stomachs and we’re just the food.
They eat us up hungrily, and when they’re full, they vomit us up.
Look, here comes Cassio and my husband.
There’s no other way.
She’s the one who’s got to do it.
And what luck, she’s here!
Go ahead and ask her.
Hello, Cassio.
How are you?
Nothing, madam.
Just my earlier request.
I’m begging you to help me get back on his good side.
I’m devoted to him with all my heart.
I can’t wait any longer.
If my wrongdoing was so serious that I can’t get back into his good graces either by my past service, or my present situation, or the promise of devoted service in the future, just knowing that would help me.
Then I could stop wondering, and find some other career.
