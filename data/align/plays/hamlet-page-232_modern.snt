that comes from thinking too much (thinking thoughts that are one part wisdom, three parts cowardice), I don’t know why I’m still alive to say “I have to do this deed” rather than having done it already.
I have the motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it.
It’s as plain as the ground beneath my feet that I must do it.
Look at this massive army led by a delicate and tender prince who’s so puffed up with divine ambition that he puts his fragile life at risk, exposing it to danger and death, for a reason as thin as an eggshell.
To be truly great doesn’t mean you’d only fight for a good reason.
It means you’d fight over nothing if your honor was at stake.
So where does that leave me, whose father has been murdered and mother defiled, ignoring these mental and emotional provocations and letting well enough alone?
Meanwhile, to my shame, I watch twenty thousand men go marching to their deaths for an illusion and a little bit of fame, fighting for a tiny piece of land not even big enough to bury them all.
From now on, if my thoughts aren’t violent I’ll consider them worthless.
