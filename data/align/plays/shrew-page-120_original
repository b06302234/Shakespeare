Mistress, your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sisterâ€™s chamber up.
You know tomorrow is the wedding day.
Farewell, sweet masters both.
I must be gone.
But I have cause to pry into this pedant.
Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale, Seize thee that list!
If once I find thee ranging, Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.
