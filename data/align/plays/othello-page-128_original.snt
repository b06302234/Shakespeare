Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do All my abilities in thy behalf.
Good madam, do.
I warrant it grieves my husband As if the cause were his.
Oh, that’s an honest fellow.
Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.
Bounteous madam, Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, He’s never anything but your true servant.
I know ’t, I thank you.
You do love my lord.
You have known him long, and be you well assured He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a polite distance.
Ay, but, lady, That policy may either last so long, Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, Or breed itself so out of circumstances, That, I being absent and my place supplied, My general will forget my love and service.
Do not doubt that.
Before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place.
Assure thee, If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it To the last article.
My lord shall never rest, I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience.
