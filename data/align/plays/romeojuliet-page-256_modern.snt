Holy Franciscan Friar!
Brother, hey!
That sounds like the voice of Friar John.
Welcome back from Mantua.
What does Romeo say?
Or, if he wrote down his thoughts, give me his letter.
I went to find another poor friar from our order to accompany me.
He was here in this city visiting the sick.
When I found him, the town health officials suspected that we were both in a house that had been hit with the plague.
They quarantined the house, sealed up the doors, and refused to let us out.
I couldn’t go to Mantua because I was stuck there.
Then who took my letter to Romeo?
I couldn’t send it.
Here it is.
Unhappy fortune!
By my brotherhood, the letter was not just a nice greeting.
It was full of very important information.
It’s very dangerous that it hasn’t been sent.
Friar John, go and get me an iron crowbar.
Bring it straight back to my cell.
