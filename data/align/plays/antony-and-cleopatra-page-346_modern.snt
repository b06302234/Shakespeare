Clouds, dissolve into rain, so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping!
This proves that I’m petty: if Iras meets Antony before me, he’ll want her first and give her the kiss that is my bliss to have.
Come, you deadly villain.
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth.
Poor poisonous fool, be angry and bite.
Oh, if you could speak, I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted!
Oh, eastern star!
Quiet, quiet!
Don’t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep?
Oh, if my heart would only break!
The poison is as sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—Oh, Antony!—No, I’ll take you too.
Why should I stay— In this vile world?
So, good-bye.
Now, Death, you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession.
Close, soft eyes.
