I’m not feeling well—that’s all.
You’re smart, though, and if you were sick, you’d take what you needed to get better.
I’m doing so.
Good Portia, go to bed.
Are you sick?
And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning?
You’re sick, yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker?
No, my Brutus, you have some sickness within your mind, which by virtue of my position I deserve to know about.
Don’t kneel, noble Portia.
