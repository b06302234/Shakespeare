Actually, my lord, my mother cried when she was giving birth to me.
But then a star danced in the sky, and that’s the moment I was born.—Kinsmen, I’m off.
Niece, will you take care of those things I mentioned?
Oh, yes, I’m sorry, uncle.—If you’ll excuse me, your grace.
I swear, she’s a very good-natured lady.
There’s very little about her that’s gloomy, my lord.
She’s only sad when she sleeps—and not even then.
Hero told me that Beatrice has often had dreams about being unhappy, and managed to wake herself from them by laughing.
She can’t stand to hear about getting a husband.
No, not at all.
She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit.
She would make a good wife for Benedick.
Oh, Lord, if they were married, they’d drive themselves crazy within a week.
Count Claudio, when do you plan to go to church and be married?
Tomorrow, my lord.
Time will move as slowly as an old man until our love receives its proper ceremony.
