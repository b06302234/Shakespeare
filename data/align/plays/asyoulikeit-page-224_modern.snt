Orlando, do you really believe that this boy can do everything he’s promised?
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don’t.
I’m afraid of hoping, but I hope anyway.
Yes, even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her.
I will, even if I were king of all kingdoms.
Yes, even if I die an hour later.
But if you decide not to marry me, you’ll marry this faithful shepherd instead?
