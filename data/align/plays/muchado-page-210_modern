Oh, noble sir!
Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep.
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands.
I will see you tomorrow, then.
Now I have to leave.
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret, who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot.
No, she wasn’t, and she didn’t know anything about it.
She has always been honest and good.
Thank you for all your efforts.
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy, and may God bless you.
