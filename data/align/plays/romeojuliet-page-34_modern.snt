Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.” That’s a nice group of people.
Where are they supposed to come?
Up.
Where?
To supper?
To our house.
Whose house?
My master’s house.
Indeed, I should have asked you before who he was.
Now I’ll tell you so you don’t have to ask.
My master is the great and rich Capulet, and if you don’t belong to the house of Montague, please come and drink a cup of wine.
Have a nice day!
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet’s traditional feast, along with every beautiful woman in Verona.
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I’ll show you.
The woman who you think is as beautiful as a swan is going to look as ugly as a crow to you.
If my eyes ever lie to me like that, let my tears turn into flames and burn them for being such obvious liars!
A woman more beautiful than the one I love?
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began.
