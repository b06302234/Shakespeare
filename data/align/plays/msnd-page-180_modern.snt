If we actors have offended you, just think of it this way and everything will be all right—you were asleep when you saw these visions, and this silly and pathetic story was no more real than a dream.
Ladies and gentlemen, don’t get upset with me.
If you forgive us, we’ll make everything all right.
I’m an honest Puck, and I swear that if we’re lucky enough not to get hissed at, we’ll make it up to you soon.
If not, then I’m a liar.
So good night to everyone.
Give me some applause, if we’re friends, and Robin will make everything up to you.
