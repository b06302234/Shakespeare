Caesar, I shall.
Gallus, go you along.
Where’s Dolabella, To second Proculeius?
Dolabella!
Let him alone, for I remember now How he’s employed.
He shall in time be ready.
Go with me to my tent, where you shall see How hardly I was drawn into this war, How calm and gentle I proceeded still In all my writings.
Go with me and see What I can show in this.
