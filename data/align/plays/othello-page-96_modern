Speaking for myself—and no offense to the general or anyone else—I hope I’m going to heaven.
Me too, lieutenant.
Okay, but please not before me.
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign.
But let’s stop this drinking and get down to business.—God forgive our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business.
By the way, I don’t want anyone thinking I’m drunk.
This is my ensign.
This is my right hand, and this is my left hand.
I’m not drunk.
I can stand well enough, and I can speak just fine.
Yes, you’re speaking very well.
Yes, very well.
So don’t think that I’m drunk.
Let’s go to the platform where we’ll stand guard.
Come on.
You see that man who just left?
He’s a good soldier, good enough to be Caesar’s right-hand man.
But he has a serious weakness.
It’s too bad.
I’m worried that Othello trusts him too much, and it’ll be bad for Cyprus eventually.
But is he often like this?
