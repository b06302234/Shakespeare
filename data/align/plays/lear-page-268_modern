My sister’s servant Oswald has certainly run into trouble.
I’m afraid that may be the case, madam.
Now, my sweet lord, you know how much I like you.
Tell me truthfully, do you love my sister?
Yes, truly and honorably.
But have you ever gone in my brother-in-law’s bed and had sex with her?
No.
You dishonor yourself and our relationship by thinking that.
I’m just worried that you’ve been cozying up to her, and gotten intimate with her.
No, I swear on my honor, I haven’t, madam.
