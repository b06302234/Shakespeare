So he’s dead?
Yes, and he’s been carried off the field.
Your grief should not be equal to his worth, because then your sorrow would never end.
Were his wounds on his front side?
Yes, on his front.
Well then, he’s God’s soldier now!
If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head, I couldn’t hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did.
And that’s all there is to it.
He is worth more mourning than that, and I will mourn for him.
He is worth no more than that.
They tell me he died well, and settled his scores.
With that, I hope God is with him!
Here comes better news.
Hail, king!
Because that’s what you are now.
Look, here I have Macbeth’s cursed head.
We are free from his tyranny.
I see that you have the kingdom’s noblemen around you, and they’re thinking the same thing as me.
I want them to join me in this loud cheer, Hail, King of Scotland!
