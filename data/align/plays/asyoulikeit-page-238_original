Welcome, young man.
Thou offer’st fairly to thy brothers' wedding: To one his lands withheld, and to the other A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
First, in this forest let us do those ends That here were well begun and well begot, And, after, every of this happy number That have endured shrewd days and nights with us Shall share the good of our returnèd fortune According to the measure of their states.
Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity, And fall into our rustic revelry.
Play, music.—And you brides and bridegrooms all, With measure heaped in joy to th' measures fall.
Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly, The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
He hath.
To him will I.
Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned.
You to your former honor I bequeath; Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
You to a love that your true faith doth merit.
You to your land, and love, and great allies.
You to a long and well-deservèd bed.
