She said something she shouldn’t have said, I’m sure of that.
Heaven knows what secrets she’s keeping.
I still have the smell of blood on my hand.
All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand smell better.
Oh, oh, oh!
What a heavy sigh!
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight.
I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen.
Well, well, well.
I hope what she’s saying is well, sir!
This disease is beyond my medical skills.
But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t guilty of anything.
Wash your hands.
Put on your nightgown.
Don’t look so frightened.
I tell you again, Banquo is buried.
He cannot come out of his grave.
Is this true?
To bed, to bed!
There’s a knocking at the gate.
Come, come, come, come, give me your hand.
What’s done cannot be undone.
To bed, to bed, to bed!
Will she go to bed now?
