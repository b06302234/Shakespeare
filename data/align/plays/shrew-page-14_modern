For God’s sake, would someone bring me a mug of beer!
Wouldn’t your Lordship prefer some imported wine?
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit?
What garment would your Honor like to wear today?
I’m Christopher Sly.
Don’t call me “your Honor” and “your Lordship.” I’ve never had imported wine in my life, and if you want to bring me something “dried,” try beef jerky.
Why ask me what “garment” I’ll wear?
I have no more jackets than I have backs, no more leggings than I have legs, and no more shoes than I have feet—in fact, sometimes I have  May Heaven put an end to this foolish fantasy of your Honor’s!
How terrible that a man of your influence and noble family, with so much wealth and an excellent reputation, should be infected with such a horrible illness!
