The other kings throughout the world all expect you to take the offensive, just like your lion-hearted forebears.
They know your Grace has justification, as well as the money and military strength.
And so you do.
No king of England was ever backed by wealthier nobles or more loyal subjects.
Their bodies may remain here in England, but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already.
Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear king, to win back what’s rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire.
And to that end, we, the clergy, will raise your Highness a sum greater than your ancestors were ever given at any one time.
We must not only arm ourselves to invade France, but must also apportion troops to defend against invasion by the Scots, who will see this as a perfect opportunity to attack.
Your subjects in the north, gracious sovereign, will provide a wall of defense against Scottish thieves across the border.
I don’t mean merely bands of thieves.
What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland—always an unreliable neighbor.
You’ll find that my great-grandfather never went to war with France without Scotland making an attack on his undefended kingdom, pouring in full force like the tide through a gap in a dyke, troubling the depleted country with violent attacks, and laying siege to towns and castles.
The whole of England, being unprotected, trembled with fear.
