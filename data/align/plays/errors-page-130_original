I never did deny it.
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
These ears of mine, thou know’st did hear thee.
Fie on thee, wretch.
Tis pity that thou liv’st To walk where any honest men resort.
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus.
I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand.
I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
Hold, hurt him not, for God’s sake.
He is mad.— Some get within him; take his sword away.
Bind dromio too, and bear them to my house!
Run, master, run.
For God’s sake, take a house.
This is some priory.
In, or we are spoiled.
