Away with him!
Who hath made this havoc with them?
I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed together.
Will you help?—An ass-head, and a coxcomb, and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.
I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman, But, had it been the brother of my blood, I must have done no less with wit and safety.
You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that I do perceive it hath offended you.
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows We made each other but so late ago.
One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!
A natural perspective, that is and is not!
Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee!
Sebastian are you?
Fear’st thou that, Antonio?
