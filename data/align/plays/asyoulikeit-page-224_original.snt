Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy Can do all this that he hath promisèd?
I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not, As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
You will bestow her on Orlando here?
That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
That will I, should I die the hour after.
But if you do refuse to marry me, You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
