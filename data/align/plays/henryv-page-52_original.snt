Fore God, his grace is bold to trust these traitors.
They shall be apprehended by and by.
How smooth and even they do bear themselves, As if allegiance in their bosoms sat Crownèd with faith and constant loyalty.
The king hath note of all that they intend, By interception which they dream not of.
Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow, Whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favors— That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell His sovereign’s life to death and treachery!
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham, And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
Think you not that the powers we bear with us Will cut their passage through the force of France, Doing the execution and the act For which we have in head assembled them?
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
