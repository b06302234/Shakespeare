Listen, please, give me the necklace.
This gentleman’s ready to go.
The wind is right and it’s high tide, and I’ve delayed him a long time already.
Good Lord!
You’re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised.
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it, but you started fighting with me first.
It’s getting late.
Please, sir, hurry up.
Antipholus, you hear how the man pleads with me.
Give me the necklace!
Give it to my wife, and get your money.
Come, come.
You know I gave it to you just now.
Send the necklace to her, or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me.
Damn it, this isn’t funny.
Where’s the necklace?
Let me see it.
My business cannot wait for this delay.
Pay you?
What should I pay you?
The money you owe me for the necklace.
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace.
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago.
