Good question, my girl.
My story does raise that question.
The answer, my dear, is that they didnâ€™t dare, because the people of Milan loved me too much.
The had to disguise their bloody intentions.
So, to make a long story short, they hurried us onto a ship and carried us a number of miles out to sea, where they prepared a rotten carcass of a boat, with no sails or masts or ropes, which even the rats had abandoned.
They tossed us in the water to cry to the sea that roared back at us, to sigh into the winds that sighed right back at us in pity.
God, what a burden on you I must have been!
No, my dear, you were a little angel who kept me going.
You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven, while I cried salty tears into the salty sea, and groaned at our situation.
Your smile sustained my spirits against whatever would come our way.
How did we manage to get ashore?
