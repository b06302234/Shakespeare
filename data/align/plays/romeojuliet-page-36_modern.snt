Come on, you first decided she was beautiful when no one else was around.
There was no one to compare her to except herself.
But let your eyes compare her to another beautiful woman who I’ll show you at this feast, and you won’t think she’s the best anymore.
I’ll go with you.
Not because I think you’ll show me anything better, but so I can see the woman I love.
