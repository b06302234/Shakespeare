Will you abandon such gentle lambs, God, and throw them to the wolves?
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done?
If the oldest grief is the most revered, then mine should have the most weight here.
Let my sorrow have the upper hand.
If you can allow for comparison  I had a Richard too—namely, my husband—and you killed him.
I had my son Rutland, and you helped kill him.
