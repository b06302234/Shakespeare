Take my hand, Hastings.
From now on, I’ll forget the hatred I used to feel for you.
Dorset, embrace Hastings.—Hastings, express your affection for the marquess of Dorset.
I swear I will never break this promise of love.
And so do I, my lord.
Now, noble Buckingham, seal this alliance by embracing my wife’s friends, and make me happy in your unity.
