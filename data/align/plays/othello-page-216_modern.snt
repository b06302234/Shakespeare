Cassio can have my job.
And tonight, sir, I invite you have dinner with me.
Welcome to Cyprus.
Horny animals!
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable?
Is this the guy who’s supposed to never get emotional, and who never gets rattled, no matter what disaster happens?
He’s changed a great deal.
Is he sane?
Is he losing his mind?
He is what he is.
I won’t say anything negative about what he might be.
If he isn’t what he might be, then I wish to God he were!
Hitting his wife?
It’s true, that wasn’t such a nice thing to do.
But I wish I could say that’s the last time he’ll do it!
Is it a habit of his?
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow, and this is the first time he’s done it?
