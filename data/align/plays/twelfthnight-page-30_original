Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse.
My lady will hang thee for thy absence.
Let her hang me.
He that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colors.
Make that good.
He shall see none to fear.
A good lenten answer.
I can tell thee where that saying was born, of “I fear no colors.”  Where, good Mistress Mary?
In the wars.
And that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
Well, God give them wisdom that have it.
And those that are fools, let them use their talents.
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent.
Or to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
