Oh, thy vile lady!
She has robbed me of my sword.
No, Antony, My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled With thine entirely.
Hence, saucy eunuch!
Peace!
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death.
Death of one person can be paid but once, And that she has discharged.
What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand.
The last she spake Was “Antony, most noble Antony!” Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony.
It was divided Between her heart and lips.
She rendered life, Thy name so buried in her.
Dead, then?
Dead.
Unarm, Eros.
The long day’s task is done, And we must sleep.
Does pay thy labor richly.
Go.
Off, pluck off!
The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep The battery from my heart.
O, cleave, my sides!
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent.
Crack thy frail case!—Apace, Eros, apace.
No more a soldier.
Bruisèd pieces, go.
You have been nobly borne.
