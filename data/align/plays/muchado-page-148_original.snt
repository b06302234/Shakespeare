Take their examination yourself and bring it me.
I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.
It shall be suffigance.
Drink some wine ere you go.
Fare you well.
My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.
I’ll wait upon them.
I am ready.
Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole.
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail.
We are now to examination these men.
And we must do it wisely.
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you.
Here’s that shall drive some of them to a noncome.
Only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication and meet me at the jail.
