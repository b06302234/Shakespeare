Obey you, love you, and most honor you.
Why have my sisters husbands if they say They love you all?
Haply when I shall wed That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him, half my care and duty.
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters, To love my father all.
But goes thy heart with this?
Ay, good my lord.
So young and so untender?
So young, my lord, and true.
Let it be so.
Thy truth then be thy dower.
For by the sacred radiance of the sun, The mysteries of Hecate and the night, By all the operation of the orbs From whom we do exist and cease to be— Here I disclaim all my paternal care, Propinquity, and property of blood, And as a stranger to my heart and me Hold thee from this for ever.
The barbarous Scythian, Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved As thou my sometime daughter.
Good my liege— Peace, Kent.
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I loved her most and thought to set my rest On her kind nursery.—
