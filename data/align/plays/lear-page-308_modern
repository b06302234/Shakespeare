And my poor  He’s fainted.—My lord, my lord!
My heart will break, break.
Don’t disturb his soul.
Let it go up to heaven.
His soul would be angry at anyone who tried to keep him in the torture chamber of this life any longer.
Oh, he’s really gone.
What’s amazing is how long he lasted.
He was living on borrowed time at the end.
Carry them away.
Our business now is mourning and grief.
