I’ll give him equal thanks, so we’re even.
Ah, Juliet if you’re as happy as I am, and you’re better with words, tell me about the happiness you imagine we’ll have in our marriage.
I can imagine more than I can say—I have more on my mind than words.
Anyone who can count how much he has is poor.
My true love has made me so rich that I can’t count even half of my wealth.
Come, come with me, and we’ll do the job quickly.
Because if you don’t mind, I’m not leaving you two alone until you’re united in marriage.
