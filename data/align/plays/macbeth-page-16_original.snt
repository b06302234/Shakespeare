Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
By Sinel’s death I know I am thane of Glamis.
But how of Cawdor?
The thane of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman, and to be king Stands not within the prospect of belief, No more than to be Cawdor.
Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence, or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting.
Speak, I charge you.
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, And these are of them.
Whither are they vanished?
Into the air, and what seemed corporal Melted, as breath into the wind.
Would they had stayed.
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner?
Your children shall be kings.
You shall be king.
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
To the selfsame tune and words.
Who’s here?
