With God’s help.
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples, Gonzalo, had given us out of the kindness of his heart.
He had been chosen to carry out the plan of putting us to sea.
He also gave us clothes, linen, and other necessities that have been of great help.
Knowing how much I loved my books, he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom.
I wish I could see that man someday!
Now I’ll stand up.
May God thank you for it.
But please, father—the question is still nagging at me—why did you conjure up this storm?
You should know this: much luck is on my side, and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island.
As I see it, my fate hangs on this lucky event, and if I handle it wrong, I’ll suffer for the rest of my life.
Now, no more questions.
