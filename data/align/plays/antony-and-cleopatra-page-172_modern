Welcome, lady.
Welcome, dear madam.
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you.
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you, giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us.
Itâ€™s undeniable.
You are welcome here, sister.
I beg you to continue to be patient.
My dearest sister!
