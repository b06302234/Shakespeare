Now, my companions and brothers in exile, hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance?
Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court, with all its jealousies and intrigues?
Out here we feel the changing of the seasons, but we’re not bothered by it.
When the icy fangs of the brutal, scolding wind bite and blow on my body, even though I’m shivering with cold, I can appreciate the weather’s honesty.
I smile and think, “Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me: it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of.” Adversity can have its benefits—like the ugly, poisonous  I wouldn’t change my situation for anything.
You’re lucky, my lord, to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you.
Come, shall we hunt some deer for dinner?
It bothers me, though, that these poor spotted innocents, who, after all, are this deserted city’s native citizens, should be gouged with arrows.
