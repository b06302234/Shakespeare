Signior Angelo, please excuse us.
My wife gets angry when I’m late.
Here’s the story we’ll tell her: that I was with you at your shop, watching you make her necklace, and that you’re going to deliver it tomorrow.
But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him, told him I’d given him a thousand marks in gold, and then lied about my wife and my house.
You drunkard, what was that all about?
Say what you want, but I know what I know.
You beat me at the marketplace, and I have the bruises to prove it.
If my skin were paper and your punches were ink, you could read the beating on my body.
I think you’re an ass.
Honestly, it sure looks that way, judging by all the beatings and the bad treatment I’m getting.
Since I’m an ass, I ought to kick like one.
Then you’d be scared of me and keep away.
Signior Balthasar, you look upset.
I hope the good meal I’m going to give you will show the goodwill I bear you and how welcome you are.
