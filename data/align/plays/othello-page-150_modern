giving it back to him.
That will tell you a lot.
But in the meantime, just assume that I’m paranoid—as I’m pretty sure I am—and keep thinking she’s innocent, please.
Don’t worry about how I handle it.
I’ll say goodbye once more.
This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about human behavior.
If it turns out that she really is running around on me, I’ll send her away, even though it’ll break my heart.
Maybe because I’m black, and I don’t have nice manners like courtiers do, or because I’m getting old—but that’s not much—She’s gone, and I’ve been cheated on.
I have no choice but to hate her.
Oh what a curse marriage is!
We think our beautiful wives belong to us, but their desires are free!
I’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the rest of her with others.
This is the plague of important men—our wives betray us more than those of poor men.
It’s our destiny, like death.
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born.
Oh, here she comes.
If she’s cheated on me, then heaven itself is a fake.
I don’t believe it.
