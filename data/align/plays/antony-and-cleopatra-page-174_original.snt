I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
But why, why, why?
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars And sayst it is not fit.
Well, is it, is it?
Is ’t not denounced against us?
Why should not we Be there in person?

Your presence needs must puzzle Antony, Take from his heart, take from his brain, from ’s time What should not then be spared.
He is already Traduced for levity, and ’tis said in Rome That Photinus, an eunuch, and your maids Manage this war.
Sink Rome!
And their tongues rot That speak against us!
A charge we bear i’ th’ war, And as the president of my kingdom will Appear there for a man.
Speak not against it.
I will not stay behind.
