Now begin, For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream And greedily devour the treacherous bait.
So angle we for Beatrice, who even now Is couchèd in the woodbine coverture.
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.—   No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful.
I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock.
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
So says the Prince and my new-trothèd lord.
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it, But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick, To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it.
Why did you so?
Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
