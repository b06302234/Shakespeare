I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the lie direct, and so we measured swords and parted.
Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners.
I will name you the degrees: the first, “the retort courteous”; the second, “the quip modest”; the third, “the reply churlish”; the fourth, “the reproof valiant”; the fifth, “the countercheque quarrelsome”; the sixth, “the lie with circumstance”; the seventh, “the lie direct.” All these you may avoid but the lie direct, and you may avoid that, too, with an “if.” I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an “if,” as: “If you said so, then I said so.” And they shook hands and swore brothers.
Your “if” is the only peacemaker: much virtue in “if.”  Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
He’s as good at anything and yet a fool.
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things, made even, Atone together.
