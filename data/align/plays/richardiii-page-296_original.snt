My liege, the duke of Buckingham is taken.
That is the best news.
That the earl of Richmond Is with a mighty power landed at Milford, Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
Away towards Salisbury!
While we reason here, A royal battle might be won and lost.
Someone take order Buckingham be brought To Salisbury.
The rest march on with me.
