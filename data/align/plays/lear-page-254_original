Sit you down, father.
Rest you.
Let’s see these pockets.
The letters that he speaks of  May be my friends.
He’s dead.
I am only sorry  He had no other death’s-man.
Let us see.
Leave, gentle wax, and, manners, blame us not.
To know our enemies' minds, we rip their hearts.
Their papers is more lawful.
Let our reciprocal vows be remembered.
You have many opportunities to cut him off.
If your will want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.
There is nothing done if he return the conqueror.
Then am I the prisoner and his bed my gaol, from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your labor.
Your—wife, so I would say—affectionate servant, and for you her own for venture,       Goneril.”  O indistinguished space of woman’s will!
A plot upon her virtuous husband’s life,  And the exchange my brother!—Here in the sands  Thee I’ll rake up, the post unsanctified  Of murderous lechers.
And in the mature time  With this ungracious paper strike the sight  Of the death-practiced duke.
For him ’tis well  That of thy death and business I can tell.
The king is mad.
How stiff is my vile sense, That I stand up and have ingenious feeling Of my huge sorrows.
Better I were distract— So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs, And woes by wrong imaginations lose The knowledge of themselves.
