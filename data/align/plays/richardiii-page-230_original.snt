Stand all apart.
Cousin of Buckingham.
My gracious sovereign.
Give me thy hand.
Thus high, by thy advice And thy assistance is King Richard seated.
But shall we wear these glories for a day, Or shall they last and we rejoice in them?
Still live they, and forever let them last.
Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch, To try if thou be current gold indeed.
Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak.
Say on, my loving lord.
Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king, Why so you are, my thrice-renownèd lord.
Ha!
Am I king?
Tis so—but Edward lives.
True, noble prince.
