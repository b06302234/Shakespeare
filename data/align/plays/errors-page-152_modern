Why are you looking at me so strangely?
You know me well.
I never saw you before in my life.
Oh, grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me.
Time has the power to deform people, and the sorrowful hours I have spent in his company have put these strange lines and wrinkles on my face.
But tell me this: don’t you know my voice?
No.
Don’t you, Dromio?
No sir, trust me, I do not.
I am sure you do.
Fine, sir, but I’m sure I don’t.
And you’re in no position to doubt my word.
You don’t know my voice?
Oh, severe Time!
Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak, sorrow-ravaged voice?
It’s true: this aged face of mine is hidden by a snow white beard, and the blood is freezing in my veins.
But I still have a little memory left, and there’s still some fire in my eyes; my dull, deaf ears can still hear a little.
All these aging faculties tell me—and I cannot be wrong—that you are my son, Antipholus.
