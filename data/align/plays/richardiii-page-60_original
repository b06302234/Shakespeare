Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales, For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales, Die in his youth by like untimely violence.
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen, Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self.
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children’s death And see another, as I see thee now, Decked in thy rights, as thou art stalled in mine.
Long die thy happy days before thy death, And, after many lengthened hours of grief, Die neither mother, wife, nor England’s queen.— Rivers and Dorset, you were standers-by, And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son Was stabbed with bloody daggers.
God I pray Him That none of you may live his natural age, But by some unlooked accident cut off.
Have done thy charm, thou hateful, withered hag.
And leave out thee?
Stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague in store Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee, O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe And then hurl down their indignation On thee, the troubler of the poor world’s peace.
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul.
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv’st, And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends.
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine, Unless it be while some tormenting dream Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils.
