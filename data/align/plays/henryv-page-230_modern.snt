If it pleases your Majesty, let his neck pay the price, if there is any martial law in the world.
How can you square things with me?
All offenses come from the heart, my lord, and nothing intended to offend your Majesty ever came from mine.
You abused me to my face.
Your Majesty didn’t present yourself as the king.
You represented yourself as just a common man.
Consider the time of night, what you were wearing, and how ordinary you looked.
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise, I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine, because if you’d been what I took you for, there would have been no offense.
Therefore, I beg your Highness, pardon me.
Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with gold coins and give it to this fellow.
Keep it, my friend, and wear it as a badge of honor in your cap until I challenge it.—Give him the money.—And you, Captain, must make it up with him.
By this day and this light, the fellow is certainly brave.
Here, twelve pence for you.
I urge you to serve God and stay out of brawls and dust-ups and quarrels and disputes.
I promise it will be better for you if you do.
I’ll have none of your money.
