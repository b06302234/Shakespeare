Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate A contract of true love.
Be not too late.
You sunburnt sicklemen of August weary, Come hither from the furrow and be merry.
Make holiday.
Your rye-straw hats put on, And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing.
I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban and his confederates Against my life.
The minute of their plot Is almost come.â€”Well done.
Avoid, no more!
That works him strongly.
Never till this day Saw I him touched with anger so distempered.
As if you were dismayed.
Be cheerful, sir.
Our revels now are ended.
These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air.
