Don’t spend any more time here.
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations.
Sir, we’ll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye.
Good-bye then, until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear, which will suit you both very well.
According to my reckoning, we’ll get to Mt.
Misena before you, Lepidus.
You’re taking a shorter route.
My plans take me a roundabout way.
You’ll get there two days before me.
Good luck, sir.
Farewell.
