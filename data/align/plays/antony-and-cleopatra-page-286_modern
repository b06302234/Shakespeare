I will catch up with you, Cleopatra, and weep for your forgiveness.
It’s the only way left, because now any extension of my life would be torture.
Since the light of my life has gone out, I’ll stop here.
Now any effort ruins what it attempts.
Yes, even power gets in its own way.
End it, then, and everything is over.—Eros!—I’m coming, my Queen!—Eros!—Wait for me.
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor.
Those famous lovers, Dido and Aeneas, will lose their admirers, and the whole place will be devoted to us.—Come, Eros.
Eros!
What can I do for my lord?
Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace.
Though I have made conquests throughout the four corners of the world and sailed with fleets so large they looked like floating cities, I don’t have as much courage as a woman.
I have less nobility than the lady who, by killing herself, says to Caesar, “Only Cleopatra can defeat Cleopatra.” You promised me, Eros, that should the ultimate moment arrive—which it has—when dishonor and disgust are inevitable, that upon my command, you would kill me.
Do it.
This is that time.
You won’t be striking me down, but defeating Caesar.
Call up your courage.
