Are you going?
It’s still a long time until daybreak.
Don’t be afraid.
That sound you heard was the  It was the lark, the bird that sings at dawn, not the nightingale.
Look, my love, what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?
Night is over, and day is coming.
If I want to live, I must go.
If I stay, I’ll die.
That light is not daylight, I know it.
It’s some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua.
So stay for a while.
You don’t have to go yet.
Let me be captured.
Let me be put to death.
I am content, if that’s the way you want it.
I’ll say the light over there isn’t morning.
I’ll say it’s the reflection of the moon.
I’ll say that sound isn’t the lark ringing in the sky.
I want to stay more than I want to go.
Come, death, and welcome!
Juliet wants it this way.
How are you, my love?
Let’s talk.
It’s not daylight.
