And we fairies, that do run  By the triple Hecate’s team  From the presence of the sun,  Following darkness like a dream,  Now are frolic.
Not a mouse  Shall disturb this hallowed house.
I am sent with broom before  To sweep the dust behind the door.
Through the house give glimmering light, By the dead and drowsy fire.
Every elf and fairy sprite Hop as light as bird from brier.
And this ditty, after me, Sing and dance it trippingly.
First, rehearse your song by rote, To each word a warbling note.
Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place.
