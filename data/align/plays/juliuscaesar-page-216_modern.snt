I’ll be back quicker than you can think a thought.
Go, Pindarus, climb a little higher on this hill.
My eyesight has always been bad.
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field.
Today was the day I breathed my first breath.
Time has come round, and I’ll end where I began.
My life has run its circle.
What news?
And listen!
They shout for joy.
Come down, look no more.
Oh, I’m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes!
