Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head.
The king is not to answer it.
I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully, but when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser.
If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.
You pay him then.
That’s a perilous shot out of an elder gun, that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch.
You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock’s feather.
You’ll “never trust his word after.” Come, ’tis a foolish saying.
Your reproof is something too round.
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient.
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
