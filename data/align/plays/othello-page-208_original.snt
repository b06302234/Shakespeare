Oh, a thousand thousand times—and then of so gentle a condition!
Ay, too gentle.
Nay, that’s certain.
But yet the pity of it, Iago!
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for if it touch not you it comes near nobody.
I will chop her into messes!
Cuckold me?
Oh, ’tis foul in her.
With mine officer!
That’s fouler.
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.
I’ll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again—This night, Iago!
Do it not with poison.
Strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.
Good, good, the justice of it pleases!
Very good!
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker.
You shall hear more by midnight.
Excellent good.
