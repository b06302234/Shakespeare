Hurry, go up to the roof.
The Lord Mayor is knocking.
Welcome, my lord.
I’m twiddling my thumbs waiting for the duke to show up.
I don’t think he wants to be disturbed.
Here comes his servant.
Now, Catesby, what does your lord say to my request?
My lord, he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day.
He’s inside in prayer, with two reverend fathers.
He doesn’t want to be disturbed in his holy work by any worldly requests.
Return to the gracious duke, good Catesby.
Tell him that the mayor, some citizens, and I have come to confer with his grace in matters of great importance concerning the general good.
I’ll tell him right away, my lord.
