Take me inside some house, Benvolio, or I’ll pass out.
May a plague strike both your families!
They’ve turned me into food for worms.
I’m done for.
Curse your families!
This gentleman Mercutio, a close relative of the Prince and my dear friend, was killed while defending me from Tybalt’s slander—Tybalt, who had been my cousin for a whole hour!
Oh, sweet Juliet, your beauty has made me weak like a woman, and you have softened my bravery, which before was as hard as steel.
Oh Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
His brave spirit has floated up to heaven, but it was too early for him to leave life on earth.
The future will be affected by today’s terrible events.
Today is the start of a terror that will end in the days ahead.
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
He’s alive and victorious, and Mercutio’s dead?
Enough with mercy and consideration.
It’s time for rage to guide my actions.
Now, Tybalt, you can call me “villain” the way you did before.
Mercutio’s soul is floating right above our heads.
He’s waiting for you to keep him company on the way up to heaven.
Either you, or I, or both of us have to go with him.
