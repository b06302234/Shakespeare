Where’s this so-called king?
Men, wait outside.
No, let us in!
Please wait.
All right, we will, we will.
Thank you.
Guard the door.
Calm down, good Laertes.
I’ve got exactly one calm drop of blood in my body, and it proclaims that  Laertes, what makes you so rebellious?
Let him go, Gertrude.
Don’t worry about my getting hurt.
God protects the king, so traitors can’t hurt him.—Tell me, Laertes, why you’re so angry.—Gertrude, let him go.—Tell me, man.
Where’s my father?
He’s dead.
But the king didn’t kill him.
Let him ask what he wants to ask.
