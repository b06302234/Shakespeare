Seyton!—I am sick at heart, When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough.
My way of life Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf, And that which should accompany old age, As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends, I must not look to have, but, in their stead, Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.
Seyton!
What’s your gracious pleasure?
What news more?
All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported.
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.
Give me my armor.
Tis not needed yet.
I’ll put it on.
Send out more horses.
Skirr the country round.
Hang those that talk of fear.
Give me mine armor.
How does your patient, doctor?
Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies That keep her from her rest.
