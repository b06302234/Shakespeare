Where is the king?
The king himself is rode to view their battle.
Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand.
There’s five to one.
Besides, they all are fresh.
God’s arm strike with us!
Tis a fearful odds.
God be wi' you, princes all.
I’ll to my charge.
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven, Then joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford, My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter, And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu.
Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee.
Farewell, kind lord.
Fight valiantly today.
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it, For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor.
He is as full of valor as of kindness, Princely in both.
