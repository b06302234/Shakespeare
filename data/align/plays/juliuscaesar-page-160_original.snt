Stand, ho!
Give the word, ho, and stand.
What now, Lucillius?
Is Cassius near?
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master.
He greets me well.—Your master, Pindarus, In his own change or by ill officers Hath given me some worthy cause to wish Things done, undone.
But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied.
I do not doubt But that my noble master will appear Such as he is, full of regard and honor.
He is not doubted.—A word, Lucillius.
How he received you, let me be resolved.
With courtesy and with respect enough.
But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old.
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling.
Ever note, Lucillius, When love begins to sicken and decay, It useth an enforcèd ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand, Make gallant show and promise of their mettle.
