Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem.
I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise.
Tomorrow, sir, I’m fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed.
Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’d hate to crush him—though I’d have to, if he challenged me.
I’m telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine.
Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward you.
I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined.
I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother.
So use your discretion.
I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger.
And you’d better be careful, because if you embarrass him at all—in fact, if he doesn’t beat you thoroughly—he’ll come after you and won’t leave you alone till he’s poisoned you or trapped you—killed you, in other words, one way or another.
It brings me to tears to say this, but there isn’t another person alive who is so young and at the same time so wicked.
Because he’s my brother, I have to take his side.
But if I really laid him bare, I’d have to weep and hang my head, and you would not believe me, his behavior is so shocking.
