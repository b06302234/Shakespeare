Keep on, countrymen.
Oh, keep your heads up, even now!
Who is so low that he wouldn’t?
Who will advance with me?
I will proclaim my name around the field.
I am the son of Marcus Cato!
An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country.
I am the son of Marcus Cato!
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus.
Brutus, my country’s friend.
Know that I am Brutus!
Oh, young and noble Cato, have you been slain?
Why, you die now as bravely as Titinius.
And you, being Cato’s son, will be honored.
I’d rather die.
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately.
Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing.
We must not.
He is a noble prisoner!
