O Bottom, thou art changed!
What do I see on thee?
What do you see?
You see an ass head of your own, do you?
Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee.
Thou art translated.
I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me, to fright me if they could.
But I will not stir from this place, do what they can.
I will walk up and down here and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.
