Now, my friendly servant, thank you.
Wait, let me hire him too.—Here’s my fool’s cap, a token of my gratitude.
Well hello, my good boy.
How are you doing?
Why, Fool?
Why?
For standing up for this unpopular king.
No, if you can’t adjust to political changes, you’ll suffer for it.
There, take my fool’s cap.
This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to.
If you work for him, you’re a fool and should wear a fool’s cap.—So how’s it going, uncle?
I wish I had two fool’s caps and two daughters.
