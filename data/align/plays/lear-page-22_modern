No, I’ll give nothing.
I won’t budge on that.
Peace to you, my lord of Burgundy.
Since you love money and power so much, I won’t be your wife.
Beautiful Cordelia, you’re all the richer now that you’re poor.
You’re more valuable now that you’re rejected and more loved now that you’re hated.
I’ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now, if it’s okay that I’m picking up what others have thrown away.
It’s so strange that in neglecting you so cruelly, the gods have made me love you so dearly.—King, the daughter you’ve rejected is now mine, as Queen of France.
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now.—Say goodbye to them, Cordelia, even though they’ve been unkind to you.
You’ll find a much better place in France than what you’re giving up here.
She’s yours, King of France.
Take her.
She’s no longer my daughter, and I’ll never see her face again.
Say goodbye to your sisters.
