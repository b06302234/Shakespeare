Peace, ho!
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber.
He hath left them you And to your heirs forever—common pleasures, To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.
Here was a Caesar!
When comes such another?
Never, never.—Come, away, away!
We’ll burn his body in the holy place, And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Take up the body.
Go fetch fire.
Pluck down benches.
Pluck down forms, windows, anything.
Now let it work.
Mischief, thou art afoot.
Take thou what course thou wilt!
How now, fellow?
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
Where is he?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.
