Nurse, where’s my daughter?
Tell her to come to me.
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve, I already told her to come.
Come on!
Where is she?
What is she doing?
What, Juliet!
What is it?
Who’s calling me?
Your mother.
Madam, I’m here.
What do you want?
I’ll tell you what’s the matter—Nurse, leave us alone for a little while.
We must talk privately—Nurse, come back here.
I just remembered, you can listen to our secrets.
You know how young my daughter is.
Yes, I know her age down to the hour.
She’s not even fourteen.
I’d bet fourteen of my own teeth—but, I’m sorry to say, I only have four teeth—she’s not fourteen.
How long is it until  Two weeks and a few odd days.
