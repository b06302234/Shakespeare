And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me, who cut her sweet prince’s life short and made her a widow?
On me, though I am barely half the man that Edward was?
On me, though I am limping and deformed?
I bet I’ve been wrong about myself all this time.
Even though I don’t see it, this lady thinks I’m a marvelously good-looking man.
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions.
Since I’m suddenly all the rage, it will be worth the cost.
But first, I’ll dump this fellow in his grave, then return to my love weeping with grief.
Come out, beautiful sun—until I’ve bought a mirror to admire my reflection in, I’ll watch my shadow as I stroll along.
