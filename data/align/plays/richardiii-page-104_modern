Noble Buckingham, your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart.
All we need to put the final touches on this future peace is for Richard to appear.
And just in time, here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe.
Good morning to my sovereign king and queen.
Noble peers, how nice to see you.
Happy indeed, the way we have spent the day.
Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity, turning enmity into peace and hate into love among these mistakenly angry nobles.
