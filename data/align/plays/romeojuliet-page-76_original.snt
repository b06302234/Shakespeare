An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
This cannot anger him.
Twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle Of some strange nature, letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjured it down.
That were some spite.
My invocation Is fair and honest.
In his mistress' name I conjure only but to raise up him.
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees, To be consorted with the humorous night.
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.— O Romeo, that she were!
Oh, that she were An open arse, and thou a poperin pear.
Romeo, good night.
I’ll to my truckle bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.— Come, shall we go?
Go, then, for ’tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found.
