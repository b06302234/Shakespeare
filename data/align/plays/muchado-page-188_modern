Every man thinks it’s his duty to advise those who are overwrought with sorrow to be patient.
But no man is so moral or so strong that they can endure the same advice when they themselves are grieving.
So don’t advise me.
My sorrow is crying too loudly to hear what you have to say.
Well then you’re no better than a child.
Please, leave me alone.
I intend to be flesh and blood, not airy philosophy, for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently, even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune.
But don’t take all that pain on yourself.
Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too.
Now you’re talking.
I definitely will.
In my soul, I believe Hero has been falsely accused.
And I’ll make sure that Claudio, the Prince, and anyone else who helped dishonor her know about it.
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way.
Good evening, good evening.
Good day to both of you.
Listen, my lords— We’re in a bit of a hurry, Leonato.
