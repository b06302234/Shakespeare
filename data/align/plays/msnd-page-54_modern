Okay, let’s go!
Everything’s fine now.
One of us will stay and stand guard.
Whatever you see first when you wake up, think of it as your true love.
Love him and yearn for him, even if he’s a lynx, a cat, a bear, a leopard, or a wild boar.
Whatever’s there when you wake up will be dear to you.
Wake up when something nasty is nearby.
My love, you look like you’re about to faint from wandering in the woods for so long, and to tell you the truth, I’ve gotten us lost.
