Not in a grave, To lay one in, another out to have.
I pray thee, chide not.
Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
The other did not so.
Oh, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect Iâ€™ll thy assistant be, For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households' rancor to pure love.
Oh, let us hence.
I stand on sudden haste.
Wisely and slow.
They stumble that run fast.
