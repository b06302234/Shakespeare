See!
Even Antony, who stays up all night partying, is awake.
Good morning, Antony.
And to you, most noble Caesar.
Tell them to prepare the other room for guests.
I’m to blame for making you wait for me.
Now, Cinna.
Now, Metellus.
Trebonius!
I have an hour-long matter to discuss with you.
Remember to see me today.
Stay near me so I’ll remember.
Caesar, I will.
Good friends, go in and have some wine with me.
And we’ll leave together, like friends.
