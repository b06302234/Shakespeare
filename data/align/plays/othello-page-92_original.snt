If I can fasten but one cup upon him, With that which he hath drunk tonight already, He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog.
Now my sick fool Roderigo, Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out, To Desdemona hath tonight caroused Potations pottle-deep, and he’s to watch.
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits (That hold their honors in a wary distance, The very elements of this warlike isle) Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups, And they watch too.
Now ’mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle.
But here they come.
If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
Fore heaven, they have given me a rouse already.
Good faith, a little one, not past a pint, As I am a soldier.
Some wine, ho!
