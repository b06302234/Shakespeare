Believe me, I’m sorry you’re in pain.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what did my love Romeo say?
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, who is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I believe, virtuous— where is your mother?
Where is my mother?
Why, she’s inside.
Where else would she be?
Your answer is so strange!
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, 'Where is your mother?
Oh holy Mary, mother of God!
Are you this impatient?
Come on, you’re being ridiculous!
Is this the cure for my aching bones?
From now on, take care of your messages yourself.
You’re making such a fuss.
Come on, what did Romeo say?
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today?
I do.
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
There’s a husband there who’s waiting to make you his wife.
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks.
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news.
Go to the church.
I must go by a different path to get a rope ladder.
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it’s dark.
I do the drudge work for your pleasure.
But soon you’ll be doing a wife’s work all night long.
Go.
I’ll go to lunch.
You go to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
