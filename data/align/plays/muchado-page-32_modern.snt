Really, my lord, why are you so excessively sad?
The things that cause my sadness are without limit.
Therefore my sadness is without limit.
You should listen to reason.
Then you’d stop being so gloomy.
And after I have sat and listened to reason, what’s my prize?
If not an end to your suffering, then at least you’ll have the means to endure it patiently.
I’m amazed that you—being such a moody man yourself—are moralizing about my deadly condition.
I can’t hide what I am.
I’ll be sad when I have reason to be sad and won’t smile at anybody’s jokes.
I’ll eat when I’m hungry and won’t wait until it’s convenient.
I’ll sleep when I’m tired and won’t rouse myself for anything.
I’ll laugh when I’m happy and won’t flatter and fawn over anyone.
Sure, but don’t do it at full volume until there’s no danger in it.
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother, and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you.
You need to act carefully if you’re going to stay in his good graces.
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose.
