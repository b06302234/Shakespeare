So may Your Highness, and yet punish, too.
Sir, you show great mercy if you give him life After the taste of much correction.
Alas, your too much love and care of me Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch.
If little faults proceeding on distemper Shall not be winked at, how shall we stretch our eye When capital crimes, chewed, swallowed, and digested, Appear before us?
We’ll yet enlarge that man, Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care And tender preservation of our person, Would have him punished.
And now to our French causes.
Who are the late commissioners?
I one, my lord.
Your Highness bade me ask for it today.
So did you me, my liege.
And I, my royal sovereign.
Then, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, there is yours.
There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham.
And, sir knight, Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours.
Read them, and know I know your worthiness.
My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter, We will aboard tonight.—Why, how now, gentlemen?
What see you in those papers, that you lose So much complexion?—Look you, how they change.
Their cheeks are paper.—Why, what read you there That have so cowarded and chased your blood Out of appearance?
