Not stingless too?
Oh, yes, and soundless too.
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony, And very wisely threat before you sting.
Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar.
You showed your teeth like apes, and fawned like hounds, And bowed like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet, Whilst damnèd Casca, like a cur, behind Struck Caesar on the neck.
O you flatterers!
Flatterers?—Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruled.
Come, come, the cause.
If arguing make us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
When think you that the sword goes up again?
Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands Unless thou bring’st them with thee.
So I hope.
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.
