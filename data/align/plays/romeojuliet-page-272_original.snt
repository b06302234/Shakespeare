As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him.
Romeo!— Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher?
What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolored by this place of peace?
Romeo!
O, pale!—Who else?
What, Paris too?
And steeped in blood?—Ah, what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs.
O comfortable Friar!
Where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.
Where is my Romeo?
I hear some noise.
Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents.
Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead, And Paris too.
Come, I’ll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
Come, go, good Juliet.
I dare no longer stay.
