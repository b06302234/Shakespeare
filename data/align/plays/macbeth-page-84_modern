Now you have it all: you’re the king, the thane of Cawdor, and the thane of Glamis, just like the weird women promised you.
And I suspect you cheated to win these titles.
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead.
If the witches tell the truth—which they did about you—maybe what they said about me will come true too.
But shhh!
I’ll shut up now.
If we forgot him, our big celebration wouldn’t be complete, and that wouldn’t be any good.
Whatever your highness commands me to do, it is always my duty to do it.
