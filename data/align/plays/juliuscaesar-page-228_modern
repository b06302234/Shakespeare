Make room!
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken.
I’ll tell him the news.
Oh, here comes the general—Brutus has been caught, Brutus is taken, my lord.
Where is he?
He’s safe, Antony.
I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive.
The gods protect him from so great a shame!
When you do find him, alive or dead, he’ll be found on his own terms.
