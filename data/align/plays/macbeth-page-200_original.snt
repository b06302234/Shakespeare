Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn.
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up.
Were they not forced with those that should be ours, We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home.
What is that noise?
It is the cry of women, my good lord.
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
The time has been my senses would have cooled To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in ’t.
I have supped full with horrors.
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me.
Wherefore was that cry?
The queen, my lord, is dead.
