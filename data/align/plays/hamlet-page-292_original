What ceremony else?
That is Laertes, a very noble youth, mark.
What ceremony else?
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warranty.
Her death was doubtful, And, but that great command o'ersways the order, She should in ground unsanctified have lodged Till the last trumpet.
For charitable prayers Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her.
Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants, Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home Of bell and burial.
Must there no more be done?
No more be done.
We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.
Lay her i' th' earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring!
I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling.
