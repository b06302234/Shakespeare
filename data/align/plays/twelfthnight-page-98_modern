Come along with us, Signor Fabian.
I’m coming, don’t worry.
If I miss this, let me be boiled alive.
Won’t you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated?
I’ll be thrilled.
You know, he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here.
We’ll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry, and we’ll mock him till he’s black and blue.
Won’t we, Sir Andrew?
If we don’t, it’ll be the biggest disappointment of our lives.
Here comes the little villain herself.
How are you, my golden girl?
Hide behind the boxwood hedge, all three of you.
Malvolio’s coming down the path.
He’s been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour.
Watch him carefully if you want to have some fun, guys.
This letter’s going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot.
Now hide, for God’s sake!
