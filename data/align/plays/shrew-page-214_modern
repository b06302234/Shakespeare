Quickly and quietly, sir.
The priest is already there.
We’re off, Biondello.
But they may need you at home, so you go on back.
I’ll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master’s.
I wonder why Cambio hasn’t shown up in all this time.
Here is the door, sir.
This is Lucentio’s house.
My father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace.
That’s where I’m going now, so I’ll leave you here.
You must not go without having a drink first.
I think I may presume to welcome you, and they’re probably preparing some kind of feast to welcome me.
They’re pretty busy in there.
You’d better knock louder.
