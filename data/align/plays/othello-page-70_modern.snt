If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be sick of her by now.
On the contrary, she’s a soft-spoken woman.
No, she talks too much.
She’s always talking when I want to sleep.
I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a bit quiet.
But she’s scolding me silently.
You have no reason to say that.
Come on, come on.
You women are all the same.
You’re as pretty as pictures when you’re out in public, but in your own houses you’re as noisy as jangling bells.
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats.
You make yourselves sound like saints when you’re complaining about something, but you act like devils when someone offends you.
You don’t take your jobs as housewives seriously, and you’re shameless hussies in bed.
Shame on you, you slanderer!
No, it’s true, or if it’s not, I’m a villain.
You wake up to have fun, and you start work when you go to bed.
You clearly have nothing good to say about me.
No, I don’t.
But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say?
