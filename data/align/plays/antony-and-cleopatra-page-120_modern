Yes, for your own safety, you should deny one thing: you have been a great thief at sea.
As you were on land.
That’s the one part of my service on land I do deny.
But let’s shake hands, Menas.
If our eyes were policemen, they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing.
Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do.
But no beautiful woman has an honest face.
That’s no lie.
They steal hearts.
We came here to fight against you.
For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match.
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune.
If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying.
That’s the truth, sir.
We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here.
Is he married to Cleopatra?
Caesar’s sister is named Octavia.
That’s true, sir.
She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife.
But she is now Mark Antony’s wife.
Excuse me, sir?
It’s true.
Then Caesar and he will always be united.
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t say that.
