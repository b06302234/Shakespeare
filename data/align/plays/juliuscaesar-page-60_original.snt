But what of Cicero?
Shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us.
Let us not leave him out.
No, by no means.
O, let us have him, for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy menâ€™s voices to commend our deeds.
It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands.
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear, But all be buried in his gravity.
O, name him not.
Let us not break with him, For he will never follow anything That other men begin.
Then leave him out.
