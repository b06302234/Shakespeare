How are you doing, madam?
And how are  At him, at him!
Look how pale he is and how he glares at me.
Preaching even at stones, he could get them to act.
Who are you talking to?
You don’t see anything?
Nothing at all, but I can see everything that’s here.
And you don’t hear anything?
No, nothing but us talking.
Look, look how it’s sneaking away!
My father, dressed just like he was when he was alive!
Look, he’s going out the door right now!
