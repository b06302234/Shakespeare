Give me thy torch, boy.
Hence, and stand aloof.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yon yew trees lay thee all along, Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground— So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, But thou shalt hear it.
Whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear’st something approach.
Give me those flowers.
Do as I bid thee, go.
Here in the churchyard.
Yet I will adventure.
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew— O woe!
Thy canopy is dust and stones— Which with sweet water nightly I will dew.
Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans, The obsequies that I for thee will keep Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursèd foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
What with a torch!
Muffle me, night, awhile.
