I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it.
And here he stands.
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters.
Now in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.
An â€™twere to me, I should be mad at it.
And swear I lost the ring defending it.
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begged it and indeed Deserved it too.
And then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begged mine.
And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings.
What ring gave you my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it.
but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it.
It is gone.
Even so void is your false heart of truth.
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed Until I see the ring.
Nor I in yours Till I again see mine.
