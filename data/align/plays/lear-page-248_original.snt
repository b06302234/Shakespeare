I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.
What, I will be jovial.
Come, come.
I am a king, my masters, know you that?
You are a royal one, and we obey you.
Then there’s life in ’t.
Come, an if you get it, you shall get it by running.
Sa, sa, sa, sa.
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, Past speaking of in a king.
Thou hast a daughter Who redeems nature from the general curse Which twain have brought her to.
Hail, gentle sir.
Sir, speed you.
What’s your will?
Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
Most sure and vulgar.
Everyone hears that That can distinguish sound.
But, by your favor, how near’s the other army?
Near and on speedy foot.
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought.
I thank you, sir.
That’s all.
