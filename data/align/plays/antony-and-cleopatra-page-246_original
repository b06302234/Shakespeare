The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land!
Hadst thou done so, The kings that have revolted, and the soldier That has this morning left thee, would have still Followed thy heels.
Who’s gone this morning?
Who?
One ever near thee.
Call for Enobarbus He shall not hear thee, or from Caesar’s camp Say “I am none of thine.”                                                    What sayest thou?
Sir, He is with Caesar.
Sir, his chests and treasure He has not with him.
Is he gone?
Most certain.
Go, Eros, send his treasure after.
Do it.
Detain no jot, I charge thee.
Write to him— I will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings.
Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master.
Oh, my fortunes have Corrupted honest men!
Dispatch.—Enobarbus!
