What, would you make me mad?
Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton Heath, by birth a peddler, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bearherd, and now by present profession a tinker?
Ask Marian Hacket, the fat alewife of Wincot, if she know me not!
If she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lying’st knave in Christendom.
What!
I am not bestraught!
Here’s— Oh, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
Oh, this is it that makes your servants droop!
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth, Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment, And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee, Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have music?
Hark!
Apollo plays, And twenty cagèd nightingales do sing: Or wilt thou sleep?
We’ll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis.
Say thou wilt walk, we will bestrew the ground.
Or wilt thou ride?
Thy horses shall be trapped, Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Dost thou love hawking?
Thou hast hawks will soar Above the morning lark.
Or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
