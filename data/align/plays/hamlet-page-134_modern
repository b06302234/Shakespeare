And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy?
He admits he feels confused, but refuses to say why.
And he’s not exactly eager to be interrogated.
He’s very sly and dances around our questions when we try to get him to talk about how he feels.
Did he treat you well when you saw him?
Yes, in a very gentlemanly way.
But it seemed like he had to force himself to be nice to us.
He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at length.
Did you try tempting him with some entertainment?
Madam, some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here.
We told Hamlet about them, and that seemed to do him good.
