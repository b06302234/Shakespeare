Good thinking.
I have it on me here.
Tut, tut, my lord, we’re not going to stand around chit-chatting.
Talkers aren’t good doers.
Rest assured that we’re going there to use our hands, not our tongues.
When fools cry, you remain stony.
I like you guys.
Go straight to work.
Hurry now, get the job done.
We will, my noble lord.
