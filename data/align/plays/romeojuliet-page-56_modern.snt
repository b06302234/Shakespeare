The wind you’re talking about is blowing us off our course.
Dinner is over, and we’re going to get there too late.
I’m worried we’ll get there too early.
I have a feeling this party tonight will be the start of something bad, something that will end with my own death.
But whoever’s in charge of where my life’s going can steer me wherever they want.
Onward, lover boys!
Beat the drum.
