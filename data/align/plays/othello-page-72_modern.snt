Don’t make me do it, my lady.
I’m critical by nature.
Come on, just try.—By the way, has someone gone down to the harbor?
Yes, madam.
I’m not as happy as I seem.
I’m just trying not to show how worried I am about Othello’s safety.
Come on, what would you say about me?
I’m trying to think of something, but I’m not good at inventing clever things.
It takes time.
Ah, I’ve got it.
If a woman is pretty and smart, she uses her good looks to get what she wants.
Very clever!
But what if the woman is smart but ugly?
Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her.
This is getting worse and worse!
What if she’s pretty but stupid?
No pretty woman is stupid, because her stupidity will make her more attractive to men.
These are stupid old jokes that men tell each other in bars.
What horrible thing do you have to say about a woman who’s both ugly and stupid?
No matter how ugly or stupid the woman is, she plays the same dirty tricks that the smart and pretty ones do.
