An I thought that, I’d forswear it.
I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
What is “pourquoi”?
Do, or not do?
I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting.
O, had I but followed the arts!
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
Why, would that have mended my hair?
Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
But it becomes me well enough, does ’t not?
Excellent.
It hangs like flax on a distaff.
And I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off.
Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
Your niece will not be seen.
Or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me.
The count himself here hard by woos her.
She’ll none o' the count.
She’ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit.
I have heard her swear ’t.
Tut, there’s life in ’t, man.
