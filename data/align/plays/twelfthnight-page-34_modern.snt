Get that fool out of here.
Didn’t you hear her, guys?
Get the lady out of here.
Oh, go away, you’re a boring fool.

If you tell a bad man to mend his wicked ways, and he does, he won’t be bad anymore.
If he cannot, let the tailor mend him.
Anything that’s mended is only patched up.
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin.
And a sinner who does something good is only patched up with goodness.
If this logic works, that’s great.

Please let me prove you’re a fool.
Can you do that?
Easily, madam.
