Royal seductress!
She lured Julius Caesar into her bed, he made love to her, and she bore  I saw her once hop forty feet down the street.
When she stopped she was so out of breath that she was panting.
Her beauty made even that weakness seem perfect, and even in her breathlessness she seemed to pour out breath.
Now Antony has to leave her completely.
He’ll never leave her.
Age won’t wither her, and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring.
With other women, the more familiar you grow with them the less appealing they become.
Cleopatra, on the other hand, makes you desire her the more you see her.
Even her worst faults are charming, and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut.
If beauty, wisdom, and modesty can settle Antony’s restless heart, Octavia will be the best thing that has ever happened to him.
Let’s go.
Good Enobarbus, consider yourself my guest as long as you’re here.
I humbly thank you.
