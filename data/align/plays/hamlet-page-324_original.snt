One.
No.
Judgment?
A hit, a very palpable hit.
Well, again.
Stay, give me drink.—Hamlet, this pearl is thine.
Here’s to thy health.
Give him the cup.
I’ll play this bout first.
Set it by a while.
Come.
Another hit.
What say you?
A touch, a touch, I do confess ’t.
Our son shall win.
He’s fat, and scant of breath.— Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
