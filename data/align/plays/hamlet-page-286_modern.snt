How long ago was that?
You don’t know that?
Any fool could tell you, it was the day that young Hamlet was born—the one who went crazy and got sent off to England.
Why was he sent to England?
Because he was crazy.
He’ll recover his sanity there.
Or if he doesn’t, it won’t matter in England.
Why not?
Because nobody will notice he’s crazy.
Everyone there is as crazy as he is.
How did he go crazy?
In a strange way, they say.
What do you mean, “in a strange way”?
By losing his mind.
On what grounds?
Right here in Denmark.
I’ve been the church warden here for thirty years, since childhood.
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot?
