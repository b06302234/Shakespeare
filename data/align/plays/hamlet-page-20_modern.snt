I’ve written to Fortinbras’s uncle, the present head of Norway, an old bedridden man who knows next to nothing about his nephew’s plans.
I’ve told the uncle to stop those plans, which he has the power to do, since all the troops assembled by young Fortinbras are Norwegian, and thus under the uncle’s control.
I’m giving the job of delivering this letter to you, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand.
Your business in Norway will be limited to this task.
We’ll do our duty to you in that and everything else.
I have no doubt you will.
Good-bye.
And now, Laertes, what do you have to tell me?
You have a favor you to ask of me.
What is it, Laertes?
You’ll never waste your words when talking to the king of Denmark.
What could you ever ask for that I wouldn’t give you?
Your father and the Danish throne are as close as the mind and the heart, or the hand and the mouth.
What would you like, Laertes?
My lord, I want your permission to go back to France, which I left to come to Denmark for your coronation.
I confess, my thoughts are on France, now that my duty is done.
Please, let me go.
