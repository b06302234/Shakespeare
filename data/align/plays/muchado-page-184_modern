Master Constable, tie up these men and bring them to Leonato’s.
I’ll get there first and tell him what we found out.
Come on, let’s get them  Let them be in the hands— Get off me, you fool!
Honest to God, where’s the sexton?
He should write down that the Prince’s officer was called a fool.
Come on, tie them up.
Get away from me, you ass!
You ass!
How can you call me that?
Don’t you suspect my office?
Don’t you
