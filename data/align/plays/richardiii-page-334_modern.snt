March on, be brave in battle, and letâ€™s go pell-mell to heaven, if not hand in hand to hell.
Listen!
I hear their drums.
Fight, gentlemen of England!
Fight, brave landlords!
Draw your bows all the way back, archers!
Spur your proud horses hard, horsemen, and ride in blood.
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking.
