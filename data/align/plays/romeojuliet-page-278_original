What fear is this which startles in our ears?
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain, And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new killed.
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
Here is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo’s man, With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men’s tombs.
O heavens!
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en—for, lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it mis-sheathèd in my daughter’s bosom.
O me!
This sight of death is as a bell, That warns my old age to a sepulcher.
Come, Montague, for thou art early up To see thy son and heir now early down.
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopped her breath.
What further woe conspires against mine age?
Look, and thou shalt see.
To press before thy father to a grave?
