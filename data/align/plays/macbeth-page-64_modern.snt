Knock, knock!
Never a moment of peace!
Who are you?
Ah, this place is too cold to be hell.
I won’t pretend to be the devil’s porter anymore.
I was going to let someone from every profession into hell.
I’m coming, I’m coming!
Please, don’t forget to leave me a tip.
Did you go to bed so late, my friend, that you’re having a hard time getting up now?
That’s right sir, we were drinking until 3 A.M., and drink, sir, makes a man do three things.
What three things does drink make a man do?
Drinking turns your nose red, it puts you to sleep, and it makes you urinate.
Lust it turns on but also turns off.
What I mean is, drinking stimulates desire but hinders performance.
Therefore, too much drink is like a con artist when it comes to your sex drive.
It sets you up for a fall.
It gets you up but it keeps you from getting off.
It persuades you and discourages you.
It gives you an erection but doesn’t let you keep it, if you see what I’m saying.
It makes you dream about erotic experiences, but then it leaves you asleep and needing to pee.
I believe drink did all of this to you last night.
