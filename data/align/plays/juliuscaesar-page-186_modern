I’ve practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you, but I still couldn’t bear this news like you do.
Well, let’s move on to our work with the living.
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately?
I don’t think it’s a good idea.
Why not?
Here’s why: it’d be better for the enemy to come after us.
That way, he’ll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers, weakening his own capacities, while we, lying still, are rested, energetic, and nimble.
Your reasons are good, but I have better reasons for doing the opposite.
The people who live between here and Philippi are loyal to us only because we force them to be.
We made them contribute to our efforts against their will.
The enemy, marching past them, will add them to its numbers, then come at us refreshed, newly reinforced, and full of courage.
Thus we must cut him off from this advantage.
If we meet him at Philippi, these people will be at our backs.
Listen to me, good brother.
Begging your pardon, I’ll continue what I was saying.
You must also take into account that we’ve gotten as much from our friends as they can give.
Our regiments are full to the brim; our cause is ready.
The enemy gets larger each day.
We, now at our largest, can only decrease.
There’s a tidal movement in men’s affairs.
Seizing the highest tide leads on to fortune.
If high tide is let to pass, all the rest of the voyage of their lives will be marked by difficulty and misery.
It’s on such a high tide that we’re now floating, and we must take the current when it is offered, or lose our campaign.
