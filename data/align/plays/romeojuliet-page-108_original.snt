Good morrow to you both.
What counterfeit did I give you?
The slip, sir, the slip.
Can you not conceive?
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Meaning “to curtsy”?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Pink for flower.
Right.
