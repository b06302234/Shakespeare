If the Duke keeps treating you so well, Cesario, you’ll go far.
He’s only known you for three days, but he’s already treating you like a close friend.
When you wonder whether he’ll keep treating me well, it makes me think his mood might change—or else I’ll mess up somehow.
Do his feelings toward people change suddenly?
No, not at all.
Thanks for telling me.
Here comes the Duke now.
Has anyone seen Cesario?
I’m right here, my lord, at your service.
