I also have a few things to say about that, which Hamlet just told me.
But let’s get down to business—even though people are in a frenzy of grief—to avoid any further plots and mishaps.
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage.
He would have been a great king if he had had the chance to prove himself.
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities.
Pick up the corpses.
A sight like this suits a battlefield, but here at court it shows that much went wrong.
Go outside and tell the soldiers to fire their guns in honor of Hamlet.
