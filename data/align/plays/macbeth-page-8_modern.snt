God save the king!
Where have you come from, worthy thane?
Great king, I’ve come from Fife, where the Norwegian flag flies, mocking our country and frightening our people.
Leading an enormous army and assisted by that disloyal traitor, the thane of Cawdor, the king of Norway began a bloody battle.
But outfitted in his battle-weathered armor, Macbeth met the Norwegian attacks shot for shot, as if he were the goddess of war’s husband.
Finally he broke the enemy’s spirit, and we were victorious.
Great happiness!
So now Sweno, the Norwegian king, wants a treaty.
We told him we wouldn’t even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme’s Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars.
The thane of Cawdor will never again betray me.
Go announce that he will be executed, and tell Macbeth that Cawdor’s titles will be given to him.
I’ll get it done right away.
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won.
