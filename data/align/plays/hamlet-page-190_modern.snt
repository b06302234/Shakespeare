That won’t work, since I’m still reaping the rewards of that murder: my crown and my queen.
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime?
In this wicked world, criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law, shoving justice aside.
But not in heaven.
Up there, every action is judged for exactly what it’s worth, and we’re forced to confront our crimes.
So what can I do?
What is there left to do?
Offer whatever repentance I can—that couldn’t hurt.
But it can’t help either!
Oh, what a lousy situation I’m in.
My heart’s as black as death.
My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks.
Help me, angels!
C’mon, make an effort.
Bend, stubborn knees.
Steely heart, be soft as a newborn babe, so I can pray.
Perhaps everything will turn out okay after all.
I could do it easily now.
He’s praying now.
And now I’ll do it.
