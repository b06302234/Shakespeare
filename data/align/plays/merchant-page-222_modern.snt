My dear Portia, if you knew who I gave the ring to, for whose sake I gave the ring to him, why I gave it to him, and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn’t accept anything but the ring, you wouldn’t be so angry.
If you’d known how much that ring meant, how much the woman who gave it to you is worth, or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring, you wouldn’t have let it go.
Who would be so unreasonable as to insist on taking the ring if you’d defended it with any kind of zeal?
Who would have had so little self-restraint that they’d insist on getting a ring with ceremonial value?
Nerissa’s got the right idea.
I’ll bet my life you gave some woman the ring!
No, I swear, madam.
No woman got it from me, but an expert in civil law who refused three thousand ducats but asked instead for the ring, which I denied him.
I watched him leave looking discontented, even though he had saved the life of my good friend.
What could I say, my dear?
I had to send it to him.
I was ashamed and wanted to show my good manners.
I just couldn’t dishonor myself by acting ungrateful to him.
Please forgive me, good lady.
If you’d been there, I think you would have begged me to give him the ring.
