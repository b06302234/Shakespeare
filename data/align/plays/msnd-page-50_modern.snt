Titania sleeps there sometimes at night, lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights.
Snakes shed their skin there, and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in.
I’ll put the juice of this flower on Titania’s eyes, and fill her with horrible delusions and desires.
Don’t worry, sir.
I’m at your service.
