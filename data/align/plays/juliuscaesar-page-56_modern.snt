If you went ahead and exposed your true face, Hell itself wouldn’t be dark enough to keep you from being found and stopped.
I’m afraid we’re intruding too boldly on your sleep time.
Good morning, Brutus.
Are we bothering you?
I was awake.
I’ve been up all night.
Do I know these men who are with you?
Yes, every one of them.
There isn’t one of them who doesn’t admire you, and each one of them wishes you had as high an opinion of yourself as every noble Roman has of you.
This is Trebonius.
He’s welcome here.
This is Decius Brutus.
He’s welcome too.
This is Casca.
This is Cinna.
And this is Metellus Cimber.
They’re all welcome.
What worries have kept you awake tonight?
Can I have a word with you?
