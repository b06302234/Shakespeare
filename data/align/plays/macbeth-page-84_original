Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all, As the weird women promised, and I fear Thou played’st most foully for ’t.
Yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity, But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings.
If there come truth from them— As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine— Why, by the verities on thee made good, May they not be my oracles as well, And set me up in hope?
But hush, no more.
Here’s our chief guest.
If he had been forgotten, It had been as a gap in our great feast, And all-thing unbecoming.
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, And I’ll request your presence.
Let your highness Command upon me, to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit.
