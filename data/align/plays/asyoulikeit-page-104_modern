Hang there on this tree, you lines of poetry, and bear witness to my love.
And you,  And how are you liking the shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?
Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that it’s a shepherd’s life, it’s worthless.
In the fact that it’s solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that it’s private, it’s terrible.
Now, I’m very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring.
Being a simple life, it suits me very well, but being a life without plenty, it doesn’t suit me at all.
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd?
