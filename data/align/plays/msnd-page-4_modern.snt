Thanks, good Egeus.
What’s new with you?
I’m here, full of anger, to complain about my daughter Hermia.—Step forward, Demetrius.—My lord, this man, Demetrius, has my permission to marry her.—Step forward, Lysander.—But this other man, Lysander, has cast a magic spell over my child’s heart.—You, you, Lysander, you’ve given her poems, and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter.
You’ve pretended to be in love with her, singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight, and you’ve captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair, rings, toys, trinkets, knickknacks, little presents, flowers, and candies—things that can really influence an impressionable young person.
You’ve connived to steal my daughter’s heart, making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient (like she should be).—And, my gracious duke, if she won’t agree to marry Demetrius right now, I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens.
Since she belongs to me, I can do what I want with her—as the law says: I can either make her marry Demetrius—or have her killed.
What do you have to say for yourself, Hermia?
Think carefully, pretty girl.
You should think of your father as a god, since he’s the one who gave you your beauty.
To him, you’re like a figure that he’s sculpted out of wax, and he has the power to keep that figure intact or to disfigure it.
Demetrius is an admirable man.
