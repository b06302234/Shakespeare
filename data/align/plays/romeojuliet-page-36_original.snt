Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, Herself poised with herself in either eye.
But in that crystal scales let there be weighed Your lady’s love against some other maid That I will show you shining at the feast, And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
