Maybe, but I wish I’d never laid eyes on him.
Go, daughter.
I cannot blame you now for weeping.
An insult like this would try the patience of a saint, let alone a hot-tempered shrew like you!
Master, master!
I have news—old news such as you never heard before!
You say you have news that’s old?
How can that be?
Well, is it not news that Petruchio’s coming?
Is he here?
Why, no, sir.
What then?
He is coming.
When will he be here?
When he stands where I am and sees you there.
