Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May— There will I stay for thee.
My good Lysander!
I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow, By his best arrow with the golden head, By the simplicity of Venus' doves, By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves, And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen When the false Troyan under sail was seen, By all the vows that ever men have broke (In number more than ever women spoke), In that same place thou hast appointed me, Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
Keep promise, love.
Look, here comes Helena.
Godspeed, fair Helena!
Whither away?
Call you me “fair”?
That “fair” again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair.
O happy fair!
Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue’s sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Sickness is catching.
Oh, were favor so, Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.
My ear should catch your voice.
My eye, your eye.
My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, The rest I’d give to be to you translated.
