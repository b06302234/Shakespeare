If they’re true, no punishment is harsh enough for the criminal.
How are you, my lord?
Oh, madam, my old heart is broken, broken.
Did my father’s godson try to kill you?
The one whom my father named, your son Edgar?
Oh, my lady, I’m ashamed to admit it.
Wasn’t he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father?
I don’t know, madam.
Oh, it’s too terrible.
To answer your question, ma'am—yes, he was friendly with those knights.
Then it’s no surprise they had a bad influence on him.
They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money.
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them—and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house.
And I won’t be there either.—Edmund, I’m told you’ve acted like a true son to your father.
I just did my duty, sir.
He exposed Edgar’s murderous plot, and was wounded, as you see there, when trying to apprehend him.
Are your men searching for him?
