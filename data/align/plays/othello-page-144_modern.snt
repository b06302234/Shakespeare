Why are you telling me this?
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy, tormented by new suspicions every hour?
No.
If there’s any doubt, there is no doubt.
I might as well be a goat if I ever let myself become obsessed with the kind of suspicions you’re implying.
If you say my wife is beautiful, eats well, loves good company, speaks freely, sings, plays music, and dances well, you’re not making me jealous.
When a woman is virtuous, talents like these just make her better.
And I’m not going to start feeling inferior.
She had her eyes wide open when she chose me.
No, Iago, I’ll have to see some real evidence before I start suspecting her of anything bad, and when I suspect her, I’ll look for proof, and if there’s proof, that’s when I’ll let go of my love and my jealousy.
I’m glad to hear you say that.
Now I can show you my devotion and my duty with more honesty.
So please listen to me.
I’m not talking about proof yet.
Watch your wife.
Watch how she is with Cassio.
Just watch—don’t be either completely suspicious or completely trustful.
I wouldn’t want to see you taken advantage of because you’re such an open and trusting guy.
Watch out!
I know the people of Venice well.
They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands.
They don’t avoid doing things that are wrong, they just try not to get caught.
Do you really think so?
