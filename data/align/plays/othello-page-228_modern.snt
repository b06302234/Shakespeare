So you’re saying you’re not a whore?
No, I’m as honest as I am Christian.
If only letting my husband touch my body means I’m not a whore, I’m not a whore.
What, you’re not a whore?
No, I swear it.
Is that possible?
Oh, heaven help us!
I beg your pardon then.
I must have the wrong woman.
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello.—You whorehouse-keeper.
You’re in charge of this hell!
You!
We’ve finished our business.
Here’s some money for you.
Please lock the door and keep quiet.
What’s he talking about?
How are you, madam?
I’m stunned, to tell you the truth.
My lady, what’s wrong with your husband?
