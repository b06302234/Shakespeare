Calphurnia!
Peace, ho!
Caesar speaks.
Calphurnia!
Here, my lord.
Stand you directly in Antonius' way When he doth run his course.—Antonius!
Caesar, my lord.
Forget not in your speed, Antonius, To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say The barren, touchèd in this holy chase, Shake off their sterile curse.
I shall remember.
When Caesar says, “do this,” it is performed.
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.
Caesar!
