Who made thee then a bloody minister When gallant-springing, brave Plantagenet, That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
My brother’s love, the devil, and my rage.
Thy brother’s love, our duty, and thy faults Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
If you do love my brother, hate not me.
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you are hired for meed, go back again, And I will send you to my brother Gloucester, Who shall reward you better for my life Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
You are deceived.
Your brother Gloucester hates you.
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
Go you to him from me.
Ay, so we will.
Tell him, when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm, He little thought of this divided friendship.
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
Ay, millstones, as he lessoned us to weep.
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
