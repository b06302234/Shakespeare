How many years from now will this heroic scene be reenacted in countries that don’t even exist yet and in languages not yet known!
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show, though he now lies at the base of Pompey’s statue, as worthless as dust!
As often as it’s replayed, our group will be hailed as the men who gave their country liberty.
Well, should we go out?
Yes, every man forward.
Brutus will lead, and we’ll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Wait a minute.
Who’s that coming?
It’s a friend of Antony’s.
