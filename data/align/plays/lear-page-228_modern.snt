Have my brother-in-law’s troops been mobilized?
Yes, ma'am.
Is he there in person?
Yes, making a big fuss.
Your sister’s the better soldier of the two.
Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your master at home?
No, ma'am.
What could my sister’s letter to him say?
I don’t know, ma'am.
He rushed away on serious business.
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him.
Wherever he goes, he inspires compassion and people turn against us.
I think Edmund went off to kill him, to put him out of his blind misery.
And also to find out the size of the enemy army.
I have to follow him and give him the letter.
Our troops are deployed tomorrow.
Stay with us tonight.
It’s dangerous out there.
