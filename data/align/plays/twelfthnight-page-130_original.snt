Have you not set mine honor at the stake, And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think?
To one of your receiving Enough is shown.
A cypress, not a bosom, Hides my heart.
So, let me hear you speak.
I pity you.
That’s a degree to love.
No, not a grize.
For ’tis a vulgar proof That very oft we pity enemies.
Why then methinks ’tis time to smile again.
O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf!
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you.
And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest, Your wife is like to reap a proper man.
There lies your way, due west.
Then westward ho!
Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship!
You’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
Stay, I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
That you do think you are not what you are.
If I think so, I think the same of you.
Then think you right: I am not what I am.
I would you were as I would have you be!
