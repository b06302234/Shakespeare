You’re letting yourself get carried away with these horrible thoughts.
You’ll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so.
Proculeius, Caesar has heard about what you’ve done here and has sent for you.
I’ll take the Queen into my custody.
So be it, Dolabella.
Caesar’s thanks are my greatest reward.
Be kind to her.
Tell him I’d like to die.
Have you heard of me, most noble Empress?
I don’t remember.
I’m sure you’ve heard of me.
It doesn’t matter what I’ve heard or known.
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams.
Isn’t that your habit?
I don’t know what you mean, madam.
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony.
Oh, I wish I could sleep again, so I could have another dream like that!
