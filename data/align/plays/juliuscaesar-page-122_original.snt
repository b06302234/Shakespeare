Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy.
Blood and destruction shall be so in use, And dreadful objects so familiar, That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds, And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men, groaning for burial.
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
I do, Mark Antony.
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
He did receive his letters and is coming.
And bid me say to you by word of mouth—   Thy heart is big.
Get thee apart and weep.
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water.
Is thy master coming?
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
