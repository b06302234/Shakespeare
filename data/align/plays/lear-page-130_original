What trumpet’s that?
I know ’t—my sister’s.
This approves her letter That she would soon be here.
Is your lady come?
This is a slave whose easy borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.— Out, varlet, from my sight!
What means your grace?
Who stocked my servant?
Regan, I have good hope Thou didst not know on ’t.—Who comes here?
O heavens, If you do love old men, if your sweet sway Allow obedience, if yourselves are old, Make it your cause.
Send down, and take my part!
O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
Why not by th' hand, sir?
How have I offended?
All’s not offense that indiscretion finds And dotage terms so.
O sides, you are too tough.
Will you yet hold?—How came my man i' th' stocks?
