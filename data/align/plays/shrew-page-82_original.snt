A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.
That being a stranger in this city here Do make myself a suitor to your daughter, Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me, In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is all that I request, That, upon knowledge of my parentage, I may have welcome â€™mongst the rest that woo And free access and favor as the rest.
And toward the education of your daughters, I here bestow a simple instrument And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.
BIONDELLO  If you accept them, then their worth is great.
Lucentio is your name.
Of whence, I pray?
A mighty man of Pisa.
By report I know him well.
You are very welcome, sir.
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
