Madam, do you.
Tis fittest.
How does my royal lord?
How fares your majesty?
You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead.
Sir, do you know me?
You are a spirit, I know.
Where did you die?
He’s scarce awake.
Let him alone awhile.
Where have I been?
Where am I?
Fair daylight?
I am mightily abused.
I should ev'n die with pity To see another thus.
I know not what to say.
I will not swear these are my hands.
Let’s see.
I feel this pinprick.
Would I were assured Of my condition.
O, look upon me, sir, And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.
No, sir, you must not kneel.
Pray, do not mock me.
I am a very foolish fond old man, Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less.
And to deal plainly I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
Methinks I should know you, and know this man.
