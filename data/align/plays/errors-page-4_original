Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause Why thou dep-artedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
A heavier task could not have been imposed Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable; Yet, that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense, I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
In Syracusa was I born, and wed Unto a woman happy but for me, And by me, had not our hap been bad.
With her I lived in joy.
Our wealth increased By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum, till my factor’s death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse; From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself–almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear– Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrivèd where I was.
There had she not been long but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons, And, which was strange, the one so like the other As could not be distinguished but by names.
That very hour, and in the selfsame inn, A meaner woman was deliverèd Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
Those, for their parents were exceeding poor, I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys, Made daily motions for our home return.
Unwilling, I agreed.
Alas, too soon We came aboard.
