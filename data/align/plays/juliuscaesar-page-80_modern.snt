Fierce, fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war—ranks and squadrons—until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol.
The noise of battle filled the air, and horses neighed, and dying men groaned, and ghosts shrieked and squealed in the streets.
Oh, Caesar!
These things are beyond anything we’ve seen before, and I’m afraid.
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen?
But I will go out, for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me.
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky.
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes.
Cowards die many times before their deaths.
The brave experience death only once.
Of all the strange things I’ve ever heard, it seems most strange to me that men fear death, given that death, which can’t be avoided, will come whenever it wants.
What do the priests say?
They don’t want you to go out today.
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn’t find its heart.
The gods do this to test my bravery.
They’re saying I’d be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear.
So, I won’t.
