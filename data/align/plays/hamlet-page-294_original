Sweets to the sweet.
Farewell!
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife.
I thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid, And not have strewed thy grave.
Oh, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of!
Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till of this flat a mountain you have made, T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.
Bears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers?
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.
The devil take thy soul!
Thou pray’st not well.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat, For though I am not splenitive and rash, Yet have I something in me dangerous, Which let thy wisdom fear.
Hold off thy hand.
Pluck them asunder.
