Here come some more ingredients: the scale of a dragon, a wolf’s tooth, a witch’s mummified flesh, the gullet and stomach of a ravenous shark, a root of hemlock that was dug up in the dark, a Jew’s liver, a goat’s bile, some twigs of yew that were broken off during a lunar eclipse, a Turk’s nose, a Tartar’s lips, the finger of a baby that was strangled as a prostitute gave birth to it in a ditch.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
We’ll cool the mixture with baboon blood.
After that the charm is finished.
Well done!
I admire your efforts, and all of you will share the rewards.
Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies, enchanting everything you put in.
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs.
Doors, open up for whoever is knocking!
