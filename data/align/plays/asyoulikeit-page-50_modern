No you haven’t, cousin.
Please, be cheerful.
Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me, his daughter?
No, he hasn’t.
Oh, he hasn’t?
Well, then, you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one.
Will we be separated?
Should we part, sweet girl?
No.
Let my father find another heir.
So, help me plan how we’ll escape, where we’ll go, and what we’ll take with us.
Don’t even try to take this all upon yourself, bearing your grief alone and leaving me out.
I swear by the heavens, which have grown pale in sympathy with us, I’m going with you, whatever you say.
But where will we go?
To the Forest of Arden, to find your father.
But what danger we’ll put ourselves in, two young, innocent women traveling so far!
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money.
I’ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt.
You do the same, and we’ll be able to travel without attracting any attackers' attention.
Wouldn’t it be better—since I’m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man?
I’ll wear a big sword in my belt, carry a boar-spear in my hand, and hide all my womanish fear in my heart.
We’ll maintain a swaggering, warrior look, like so many cowardly men, whose manner has nothing to do with what they’re feeling.
