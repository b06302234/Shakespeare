I do too, my lord.
They’re entirely welcome.
That’s true, and with good reason.
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio.
Before I open this letter, please tell me how my good friend is doing.
He’s not sick, my lord, but he’s very upset, and his problems are serious.
His letter will tell you how he’s doing.
