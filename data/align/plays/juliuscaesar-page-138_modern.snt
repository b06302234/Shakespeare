Read the will.
We want to hear it, Antony.
You have to read us the will, Caesar’s will.
Will you be patient?
Will you wait awhile?
I’ve said too much in telling you of it.
I’m afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.
They were traitors.
Honorable men!” The will!
The testament!
They were villains, murderers.
The will!
Read the will!
You force me to read the will, then?
Then make a circle around Caesar’s corpse, and let me show you the man who made this will.
Shall I come down?
Will you let me?
Come down.
Descend.
We’ll let you.
Make a circle; stand around him.
Stand away from the hearse.
Stand away from the body.
Make room for Antony, most noble Antony!
