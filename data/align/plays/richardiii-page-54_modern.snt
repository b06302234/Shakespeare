My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days, which you’re bringing up now to prove we’re your enemies, we followed the lawful king.
If you were king, we would do the same.
If I were king?
I’d rather be a peddler.
The thought of being king doesn’t appeal to me in the least.
You’re right to imagine that being this country’s leader brings no pleasure.
As queen, I have felt none.
