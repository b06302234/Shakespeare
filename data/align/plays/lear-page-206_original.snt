Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath.
Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits.
Bless thee, goodman’s son, from the foul fiend!
Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once: of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting-women.
So bless thee, master.
Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues Have humbled to all strokes.
That I am wretched Makes thee the happier.
Heavens, deal so still.
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man, That slaves your ordinance, that will not see Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly.
So distribution should undo excess, And each man have enough.
Dost thou know Dover?
Ay, master.
There is a cliff, whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confinèd deep.
Bring me but to the very brim of it, And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me.
From that place I shall no leading need.
Give me thy arm.
Poor Tom shall lead thee.
