Oh, my good lord, don’t make me insult music again with my awful singing.
You can tell an artist is excellent when he denies his own perfection.
Please, sing for us; don’t make me woo you anymore!
Since you put it that way, I’ll sing.
You’re like a suitor who courts a woman insincerely, swearing that he loves her even though he really doesn’t find her worthy.
Come on, please sing.
If you’d like to continue this discussion, at least do so with music.
Just know this before I begin: I can’t play a single note that’s worthy of note.
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes!
Get on with your note-playing now.
