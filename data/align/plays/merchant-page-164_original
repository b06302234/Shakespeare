Make room, and let him stand before our face.— Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too, That thou but lead’st this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act, and then ’tis thought Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange Than is thy strange apparent cruelty, And where thou now exacts the penalty— Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh— Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture But—touched with human gentleness and love,— Forgive a moiety of the principal, Glancing an eye of pity on his losses That have of late so huddled on his back Eno' to press a royal merchant down And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint, From stubborn Turks and Tartars never trained To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
I have possessed your grace of what I purpose, And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond.
If you deny it, let the danger light Upon your charter and your city’s freedom.
You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats.
I’ll not answer that But say it is my humour.
Is it answered?
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned?
What, are you answered yet?
