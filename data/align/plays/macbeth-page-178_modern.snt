I’ve stayed up with you for two nights now, and I haven’t seen any evidence of what you were talking about.
When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking?
Since Macbeth went to war, I have seen her rise from her bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her closet, take out some paper, fold it, write on it, read it, seal it up, and then return to bed, remaining asleep the entire time.
It’s unnatural to be asleep and act as if you’re awake.
When she is like this, besides walking and performing various activities, have you heard her say anything?
She says something, sir, but I will not repeat it to you.
You can tell me.
You really should.
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else, because there was no one else to witness her speech.
Look, here she comes!
This is exactly how she always looks, and—I swear it—she is fast asleep.
Watch her.
Keep hidden.
How did she get that candle?
