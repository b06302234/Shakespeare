What is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he would weep for her?
Just imagine what he would do if he had the cause for feeling that I do.
He would drown the stage with his tears and burst the audience’s ears with his terrible words, drive the guilty spectators crazy, terrify the innocent ones, confuse the ignorant ones, and astound absolutely everyone’s eyes and ears.
But what do I, a grim and uncourageous rascal, do?
Mope around like a dreamer, not even bothering with plans for revenge, and I can say nothing—nothing at all—on behalf of a king whose dear life was stolen.
Am I a coward?
Is there anyone out there who’ll call me “villain” and slap me hard?
Pull off my beard?
Pinch my nose?
Call me the worst liar?
By God, if someone would do that to me, I’d take it, because I’m a lily-livered man—otherwise, I would’ve fattened up the local vultures with the intestines of that low-life king a long time ago.
Bloody, inhuman villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain!
Ah, revenge!
What an ass I am.
I’m so damn brave.
My dear father’s been murdered, and I’ve been urged to seek revenge by heaven and hell, and yet all I can do is stand around cursing like a whore in the streets.
Damn it!
I need to get myself together here!
Hmm….
I’ve heard that guilty people watching a play have been so affected by the artistry of the scene that they are driven to confess their crimes out loud.
