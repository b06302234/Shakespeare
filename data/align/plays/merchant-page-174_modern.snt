With all my heart.—Three or four of you go welcome him.—In the meantime, I’ll read Bellario’s letter out loud.
I’ve received your letter but I’m very sick at the moment.
As it happened, when your messenger came, a young lawyer from Rome was visiting me.
His name is Balthazar.
I told him about the case of the Jew and Antonio the merchant, and we consulted many books together.
He knows my legal opinions about this matter, and he has his own expert opinions as well.
I’m sending him in my place to answer your request for someone to act as judge in this matter.
Please don’t underestimate him because he’s so young.
I never knew such a young man with such a mature head.
I leave him to you.
When you put him to the test, you’ll see how wonderful he really is.
You hear what the wise and educated Bellario writes.” And this is the legal professor, I take it.—Let me shake your hand.
Did old Bellario send you here?
Yes, my lord.
Welcome.
Please have a seat.
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court?
Yes, thoroughly.
Which one is the merchant?
And which one is the Jew?
