He called her a whore so many times, and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can’t stand to hear it.
Am I that name, Iago?
What name, madam?
What my lord said I was.
He called her a whore.
A beggar couldn’t have called his slut worse names.
Why did he do that?
I don’t know.
I just know I’m not one.
Don’t cry, don’t cry.
What a day this is!
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen, give up her father and country and friends, just to be called a whore?
Doesn’t that make you want to cry?
It’s just my bad luck.
Damn him!
How did he get such an idea?
Heaven knows.
I bet my life some evil busybody, some meddling, lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position.
I bet my life on it.
