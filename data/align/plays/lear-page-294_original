The time will bring it out.
Tis past, and so am I.
But what art thou That hast this fortune on me?
If thou'rt noble, I do forgive thee.
Let’s exchange charity.
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund.
If more, the more thou’st wronged me.
My name is Edgar, and thy father’s son.
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us.
The dark and vicious place where thee he got Cost him his eyes.
Thou’st spoken right.
Tis true.
The wheel is come full circle.
I am here.
Methought thy very gait did prophesy A royal nobleness.
I must embrace thee.
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I Did hate thee or thy father.
Worthy prince, I know ’t.
Where have you hid yourself?
How have you known the miseries of your father?
By nursing them, my lord.
List a brief tale, And when ’tis told, oh, that my heart would burst!
The bloody proclamation to escape, That followed me so near—O our lives' sweetness,
