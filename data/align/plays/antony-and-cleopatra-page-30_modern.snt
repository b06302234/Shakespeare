Now, my dearest Queen— Please, stand farther away from me.
What’s the matter?
I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news.
What, does your wife say you can come home?
I wish she’d never let you come.
Don’t let her say I kept you.
I have no power over you.
You belong to her.
The gods know— Oh, never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been.
I knew from the first it would be this way.
Cleopatra— How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true, even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves—you, who were unfaithful to Fulvia?
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart.
Such false vows are broken as soon as they are spoken.
Most sweet Queen— No, please don’t try to excuse your departure.
Just say good-bye and go.
When you begged to stay, that was the time for words.
You didn’t want to go then!
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes, and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows.
Then, all my parts seemed angelic to you.
My features are still that beautiful—or else you, the greatest soldier in the world, have become the greatest liar by overpraising them.
