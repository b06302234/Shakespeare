Didn’t I tell you she was innocent?
And the Prince and Claudio, who accused her, are innocent as well, because they were deceived by Don John.
Margaret is partially guilty, although our investigation shows that she acted unintentionally.
Well, I’m glad that everything has been sorted out.
Me too—otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio.
Hero, you and the other women should all retreat to a room.
When I send for you, come out wearing masks.
The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now.—You know your job, brother.
You have to pretend to be your niece’s father, and give her away to Claudio.
I’ll do that, without giving away our secret.
Friar, I think I need a favor from you.
What do you need me to do?
