This is a good agreement.
Now, let’s go.
A strange disease requires a strange cure.
Come, lady; you must die in order to live.
Hopefully, your wedding day is only postponed.
Have patience and endure.
Lady Beatrice, have you been crying this entire time?
Yes, and I’ll keep crying a while longer.
I don’t wish that on you.
You don’t have to; I do it of my own free will.
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused.
Oh, the man who avenged her could ask anything of me!
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you?
A very clear way, but there is no friend who will undertake it.
Can a man do it?
It’s a job meant for a man, but not you.
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you.
Isn’t that strange?
It’s as strange as this other thing which I don’t understand.
I could just as easily say that there is nothing in the world that I love as much as you.
But don’t believe me—though I’m not lying.
I confess nothing, and I deny nothing.
I feel awful for my cousin.
