Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me When I have most need to employ a friend, With hate in those where I expect most love.
And most assurèd that he is a friend, Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile Be he unto me: this do I beg of God When I am cold in love to you or yours.
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham, Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here To make the blessèd period of this peace.
And in good time, Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the duke.
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen, And, princely peers, a happy time of day.
Happy indeed, as we have spent the day.
Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity, Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate, Between these swelling, wrong-incensèd peers.
