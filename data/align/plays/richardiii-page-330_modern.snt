What did Northumberland say about Richmond?
That he was never trained as a soldier.
That’s true.
And what did Surrey say to that?
He smiled and said, “The better for us.” He’s right, and that’s how it is.
Read the time there.
Give me an almanac.
I didn’t, my lord.
Then it refuses to shine.
According to this almanac, it should have risen an hour ago.
It’ll be a black day for somebody today.
Ratcliffe!
My lord?
The sun will not appear today.
The sky frowns and scowls on our army.
I wish there wasn’t so much dew on the ground.
So, the sun won’t shine today!
Well, why should that be worse for me than it is for Richmond?
The same heaven that’s frowning on me looks gloomily on him.
