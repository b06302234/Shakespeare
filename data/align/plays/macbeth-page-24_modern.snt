Has the former thane of Cawdor been executed yet?
Haven’t the people in charge of that come back?
My king, they haven’t come back yet.
But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons, begged your highness’s forgiveness, and repented deeply.
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died.
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage.
There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking at his face.
I trusted Cawdor completely.
