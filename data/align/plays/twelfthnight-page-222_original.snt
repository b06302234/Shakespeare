A contract of eternal bond of love, Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands, Attested by the holy close of lips, Strengthened by interchangement of your rings, And all the ceremony of this compact Sealed in my function, by my testimony, Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave I have traveled but two hours.
O thou dissembling cub!
What wilt thou be When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case?
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
My lord, I do protest—    O, do not swear!
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
For the love of God, a surgeon!
Send one presently to Sir Toby.
What’s the matter?
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too.
For the love of God, your help!
I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
