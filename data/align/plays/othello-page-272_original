Will you come to bed, my lord?
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemon?
Ay, my lord.
If you bethink yourself of any crime Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, Solicit for it straight.
Alack, my lord, what do you mean by that?
Well, do it, and be brief.
I will walk by.
I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit.
No, heavens forfend, I would not kill thy soul!
Talk you of killing?
Ay, I do.
Then heaven Have mercy on me!
Amen, with all my heart.
If you say, I hope you will not kill me.
Humh!
And yet I fear you, for you’re fatal then When your eyes roll so.
Why I should fear I know not, Since guiltiness I know not.
But yet I feel I fear.
Think on thy sins.
