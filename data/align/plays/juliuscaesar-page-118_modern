I don’t blame you for praising Caesar like this, but what agreement do you intend to reach with us?
Will you be counted as our friend, or should we proceed without depending on you?
I took your hands in friendship, but, indeed, I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar.
I am friends with you all and love you all, on one condition—that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous.
Without that proof, this would’ve been a savage action!
Our reasons are so well considered that even if you, Antony, were Caesar’s son, you would be satisfied with them.
That’s all I ask—and that you let me carry his body to the marketplace and, as a friend ought to do, stand on the platform and give a proper funeral oration.
You may, Mark Antony.
Brutus, may I have a word with you?
