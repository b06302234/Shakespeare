Farewell to you.—And you.—And you, Volumnius.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep.
Farewell to thee too, Strato.—Countrymen, My heart doth joy that yet in all my life I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue Hath almost ended his life’s history.
Night hangs upon mine eyes.
My bones would rest, That have but labored to attain this hour.
Fly, my lord, fly.
Hence.
I will follow.
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.
Thou art a fellow of a good respect.
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face While I do run upon it.
Wilt thou, Strato?
Give me your hand first.
