There was no story, my lord.
She never told him she loved him.
She kept her love bottled up inside her until it destroyed her, ruining her beauty.
She pined away.
She just sat waiting patiently, sadly, smiling despite her sadness.
Her complexion turned greenish from depression.
Doesn’t that sound like true love?
We men might talk more and promise more, but in fact we talk more than we really feel.
We might be great at making vows, but our love isn’t sincere.
But did your sister die of love?
I am the only daughter in my father’s family, and all the brothers too—but I’m not completely sure about that.
Anyway, sir, should I go see the lady?
Yes, go quickly and give her this jewel.
Tell her my love won’t go away and won’t be denied.
