Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.
The cause is in my will.
I will not come.
That is enough to satisfy the senate.
But for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know.
Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.
She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, Did run pure blood.
And many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today.
This dream is all amiss interpreted.
It was a vision fair and fortunate.
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bathed, Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
This by Calphurniaâ€™s dream is signified.
And this way have you well expounded it.
I have, when you have heard what I can say.
And know it now: the senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
