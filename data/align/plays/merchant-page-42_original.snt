Mislike me not for my complexion, The shadowed livery of the burnished sun, To whom I am a neighbor and near bred.
Bring me the fairest creature northward born, Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles, And let us make incision for your love To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine Hath feared the valiant.
By my love I swear The best-regarded virgins of our clime Have loved it too.
I would not change this hue Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes.
Besides, the lottery of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.
But if my father had not scanted me And hedged me by his wit to yield myself His wife who wins me by that means I told you, Yourself, renownèd Prince, then stood as fair As any comer I have looked on yet For my affection.
