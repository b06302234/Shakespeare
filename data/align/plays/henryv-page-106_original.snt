If not, why, in a moment look to see The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand Desire the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters, Your fathers taken by the silver beards And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls, Your naked infants spitted upon pikes Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry At Herodâ€™s bloody-hunting slaughtermen.

The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated, Returns us that his powers are yet not ready To raise so great a siege.

Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest; Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.
