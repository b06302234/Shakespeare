Like the  Oh stop it, you lusty bed-hopper.
You can’t see the future.
Well, if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity, then I can’t scratch my own ear.
Your fortunes are the same.
But how?
How is that possible?
Give me details.
I’ve said what I have to say.
Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers?
By an inch, even?
Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?
Not in my husband’s nose.
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts!
Alexas!
Amen, dear goddess.
Listen to our prayer.
If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful.
Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves.
