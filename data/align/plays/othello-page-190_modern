Do you really think so?
What do you mean, do I think so?
What, just because they kissed in private?
An illicit kiss!
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but they didn’t do anything.
Naked in bed together, but without doing anything?
Come on, Iago.
That would be like playing a trick on the devil: they’d make him think they’re going to commit adultery, but then back off.
Anyone who acted like that would be letting the devil tempt them, and tempting God to condemn them.
As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a minor sin.
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief— Then what?
Then it’s hers.
And if it’s hers, I guess she can give it to any man she wants.
Her reputation is also her own.
Can she give that away too?
