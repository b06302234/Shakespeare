Zounds!
You rogue!
You rascal!
What’s the matter, lieutenant?
A knave teach me my duty?
I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.
Beat me?
Dost thou prate, rogue?
Nay, good lieutenant!
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
Let me go, sir, or I’ll knock you o'er the mazzard.
Come, come, you’re drunk.
Drunk?
Away, I say, go out, and cry a mutiny.— Nay, good lieutenant!
Alas, gentlemen— Help, ho!— Lieutenant—sir, Montano— Help, masters!—Here’s a goodly watch indeed!
