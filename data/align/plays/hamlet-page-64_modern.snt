Yes, that incestuous, adulterous animal.
With his clever words and fancy gifts, he seduced my seemingly virtuous queen, persuading her to give in to his lust.
They were evil words and gifts to seduce her like that!
Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell!
She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine.
But just as you can’t corrupt a truly virtuous person no matter how you try, the opposite is also true: a lustful person like her can satisfy herself in a heavenly union and then move on to garbage.
But hang on, I think I smell the morning air.
So let me be brief here.
Your uncle snuck up to me while I was sleeping in the orchard, as I always used to do in the afternoon, and poured a vial of henbane poison into my ear—that poison that moves like quicksilver through the veins and curdles the blood, which is just what it did to me.
I broke out in a scaly rash that covered my smooth body with a revolting crust.
And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once.
He cut me off in the middle of a sinful life.
