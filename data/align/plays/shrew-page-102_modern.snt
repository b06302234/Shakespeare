Is this your idea of success?
So much for our plan.
Relax, gentlemen.
I’ve made my choice.
If she and I are happy, what’s it to you?
When we were alone, we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant.
I tell you, though, it’s incredible how much she loves me.
Darling Kate!
She hung about my neck, smothering me with kisses, making vow after vow.
In this way, she won my heart lickety-split!
You men are rank beginners!
It’s amazing how even a timid wretch can tame the most dreadful shrew, if the two are left alone together.
Give me your hand, Kate.
I’m off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding.
Plan the feast, sir, and invite the guests.
I want my Katherine decked out in the finest clothes.
I don’t know what to say.
Well, give me your hands.
God give you joy, Petruchio.
Call it a match!
Amen to that!
We’ll be your witnesses.
Father, wife, friends—farewell!
I’m off to Venice.
Sunday is just around the corner.
We will have rings and things and fancy dress!
So kiss me, Kate.
We’re to be married on Sunday.
Was there ever a match put together so quickly?
Truly, gentlemen, this is a chancy piece of business.
I’ve made a risky investment.
