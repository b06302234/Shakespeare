Or do but lift this arm, the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke.
Give me to know How this foul rout began, who set it on, And he that is approved in this offence, Though he had twinned with me, both at a birth, Shall lose me.
What, in a town of war Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear, To manage private and domestic quarrel?
In night, and on the court and guard of safety?
Tis monstrous.
Iago, who began ’t?
If partially affined or leagued in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier.
Touch me not so near.
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him.
This it is, general: Montano and myself being in speech, There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determined sword To execute upon him.
Sir, this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause, Myself the crying fellow did pursue, Lest by his clamor—as it so fell out— The town might fall in fright.
He, swift of foot, Outran my purpose, and I returned then rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight I ne'er might say before.
When I came back— For this was brief— I found them close together At blow and thrust, even as again they were When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report.
