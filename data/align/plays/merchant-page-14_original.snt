In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair and—fairer than that word— Of wondrous virtues.
Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages.
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued To Cato’s daughter, Brutus' Portia.
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, For the four winds blow in from every coast Renownèd suitors, and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand, And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O my Antonio, had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them, I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate!
Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea.
Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum.
Therefore go forth, Try what my credit can in Venice do— That shall be racked even to the uttermost To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
Go presently inquire, and so will I, Where money is, and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake.
