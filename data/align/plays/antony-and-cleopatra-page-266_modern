If we aren’t relieved in an hour, we have to return to our barracks.
The night is bright, and they say we’ll be forming for battle by two a.m.  That last day was a hard one for us.
Oh, listen to me, night— Who is this?
Stay hidden and listen.
Be my witness, oh you blessed moon.
The men who revolted against Antony will be remembered scornfully in the history books.
But poor Enobarbus repented.
That’s Enobarbus?
Quiet!
Keep listening.
Oh, moon, you queen of sadness, drop poisonous dew on me so that my life, which continues against my wishes, will end.
Take my heart and throw it against my hard, stony sin.
My heart, which dried out with grief, will surely break apart into a powder, and that will be the end of my disgusting mind.
Oh, Antony!
You are more noble than my revolt is dishonorable.
Forgive my crimes against you, but let history record me as a fugitive traitor.
Oh, Antony!
Oh, Antony!
