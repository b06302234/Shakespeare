Yes, I swear.
You make me so happy.
I’m full of joy.
Let’s be light-hearted.
Will you sing the tune you taught me just a little while ago?
I’ll do anything you ask, monster, anything reasonable.—Come on, Trinculo, let’s sing.
That’s not the tune I had in mind.
What’s this song?
That’s the melody, played by Nobody.
Oh, forgive all my sins!
Dead men have to pay their debts.—I challenge you!—God help us.
Are you scared?
