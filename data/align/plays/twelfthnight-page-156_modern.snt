Where is he, for God’s sake?
I don’t care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him, I still want to speak to him.
Here he is, here he is.
How are you, sir?
Go away.
I don’t want to see your face.
Let me enjoy my privacy.
Go away.
Ah-ha!
Does she?
Do you even know what you’re talking about?
Get a urine sample and take it to a witch doctor to find out.
Sure thing, we’ll do it tomorrow morning.
My lady would never want to lose him.
What are you saying, mistress?
