Oh, from Italy!
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, That long time have been barren.
Madam, madam— Antonio’s dead!
If thou say so, villain, Thou kill’st thy mistress.
But well and free, If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here My bluest veins to kiss—a hand that kings Have lipped, and trembled kissing.
First, madam, he is well.
Why, there’s more gold.
But, sirrah, mark, we use To say the dead are well.
Bring it to that, The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat.
Good madam, hear me.
Well, go to, I will.
But there’s no goodness in thy face—if Antony Be free and healthful, so tart a favor To trumpet such good tidings!
If not well,  Thou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes, Not like a formal man.
Will ’t please you hear me?
