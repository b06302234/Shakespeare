Now go to the door and stay there till we call.
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
It was, so please your highness.
Well then, now Have you considered of my speeches?
Know That it was he, in the times past, which held you So under fortune, which you thought had been Our innocent self.
This I made good to you In our last conference, passed in probation with you, How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the instruments, Who wrought with them, and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say, “Thus did Banquo.”      You made it known to us.
I did so, and went further, which is now Our point of second meeting.
Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go?
Are you so gospeled To pray for this good man and for his issue, Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave And beggared yours forever?
We are men, my liege.
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men, As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs.
The valued file Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, The housekeeper, the hunter, every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive Particular addition, from the bill That writes them all alike.
And so of men.
Now, if you have a station in the file, Not i' th' worst rank of manhood, say ’t, And I will put that business in your bosoms, Whose execution takes your enemy off, Grapples you to the heart and love of us, Who wear our health but sickly in his life, Which in his death were perfect.
