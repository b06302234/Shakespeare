This guy’s wise enough to play the fool, and only clever people can do that.
He pays attention to the mood and social rank of the person he’s joking with, and also to the time of day.
And he doesn’t let go of his target when a distraction appears.
His job requires as much effort and skill as any wise man’s occupation could.
And he shows he’s very smart at playing the fool, while smart people look stupid when they play the fool.
Hello, sir.
Hello to you too, sir.
My niece would like you to come in to the house, if your business here has to do with her.
I’m headed for your niece, sir.
She’s the reason I’m here.
Taste your legs, sir.
Please go inside.
