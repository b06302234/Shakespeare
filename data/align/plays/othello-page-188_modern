I’m waiting here for the general, and I don’t want him to see me with a woman.
And why’s that?
It’s not because I don’t love you.
But you don’t love me.
Please, just walk with me a little ways, and tell me if I’ll see you later tonight.
I can only walk a little way with you, since I’m waiting here.
But I’ll see you soon.
All right, have it your way.
I have to make do.
