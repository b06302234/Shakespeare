You’re right—I’ll go quietly.
And even though I’m in a distasteful mood, I’ll work on being happy.
I know a terrific wench.
She’s beautiful and charming—a little wild, but also gentle.
We’ll eat at her place.
My wife has accused me more than once of misbehaving with this woman.
I swear to her that I haven’t, but it doesn’t change anything.
We’ll go to her place for lunch.
I’ll meet you there in an hour.
Do that.
This little prank of hers is going to cost me.
