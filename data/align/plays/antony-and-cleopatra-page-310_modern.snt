He’s dead, Caesar.
Not by public execution or an assassin’s knife.
He killed himself with the same hand that performed such brave acts.
With the courage his heart lent his hand, his hand in turn split his heart.
This is his sword.
I pulled it from his wound.
Look—his noble blood is still on it.
Listen, sad friends, though the gods may rebuke me, this news would make kings cry.
It’s strange that human nature makes us grieve for the very thing we’ve been trying to achieve.
His faults were equally matched by his virtues.
There was never a ruler as excellent as he.
But gods, you give us faults so we’ll be human.
Caesar is upset.
It’s impossible for him not to see himself in Antony.
Oh, Antony.
I drove you to this.
But we have to get rid of a disease if it threatens our body.
Either I had to ruin you, or you would have ruined me.
There wasn’t enough room in the world for both of us.
Even so, let me mourn, with tears that heal like a bloodletting, that you—my brother, my greatest competitor, my partner in rule, my friend and companion on the battlefield, the very arm of my body, and the heart in which mine own heart’s thoughts lived—that our fates could not be reconciled, which caused us to divide ourselves from one another.
Let me tell you, friends—
