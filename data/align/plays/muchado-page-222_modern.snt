Is this the family tomb of Leonato?
It is, my lord.
Here lies Hero, The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words.
To repay her for her troubles, Death Gives her undying fame.
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame.
This epitaph will hang here forever, Continuing to praise Hero after I die.
Now start the music, and sing the solemn hymn.
