You, you, sirrah, where’s my daughter?
So please you— What says the fellow there?
Call the clotpoll back.
Where’s my fool, ho?
I think the world’s asleep.
How now?
Where’s that mongrel?
He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner he would not.
He would not?
My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont.
There’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also, and your daughter.
Ha!
Sayest thou so?
I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken—for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.
