Let’s build a statue of him, near those of his ancestors!
Let him become Caesar!
Caesar’s better qualities exist in Brutus, and we will crown him.
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration!
My countrymen— Silence!
Brutus speaks.
Quiet there!
Good countrymen, let me leave alone.
I want you to stay here with Antony to pay respects to Caesar’s corpse and listen to Antony’s speech about Caesar’s glories, which he gives with our permission.
I ask that none of you leave, except myself, until Antony has finished.
Let’s stay and hear Mark Antony.
Let him mount the pulpit.
We’ll listen to him.
Noble Antony, mount the podium.
For Brutus’s sake, I am indebted to you.
