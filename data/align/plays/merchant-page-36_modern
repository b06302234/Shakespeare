Sir, last Wednesday you spit on me.
You insulted me on this day, and another time you called me a dog.
And out of gratitude for these favors, I’ll be happy to lend you the money?” I’ll probably call you those names again and spit on you, and reject you again too.
If you’re going to lend us this money, don’t lend it to us as if we were your friends.
When did friends charge interest?
Instead, lend it to me as your enemy.
If your enemy goes bankrupt, it’s easier for you to take your penalty from him.
Look at you getting all riled up!
I want to be friends with you, and forget all the times you’ve embarrassed and humiliated me.
I want to give you what you need, and not charge a penny of interest—but you won’t listen to me!
I’m making a kind offer—zero percent financing.
That really would be kind.
I’ll show you how kind I am.
Come with me to a notary and we’ll make it official.
And let’s add a little clause just for a joke.
If you don’t repay me on the day we agree on, in the place we name, for the sum of money fixed in our contract, your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh, to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like.
It’s a deal.
I’ll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice.
