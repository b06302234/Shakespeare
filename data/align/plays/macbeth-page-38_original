Whereâ€™s the thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose To be his purveyor; but he rides well, And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him To his home before us.
Fair and noble hostess, We are your guest tonight.
Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt, To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, Still to return your own.
Give me your hand.
Conduct me to mine host.
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess.
