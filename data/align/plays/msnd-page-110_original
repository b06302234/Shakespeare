You minimus of hindering knotgrass made, You bead, you acorn!
You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone.
Speak not of Helena.
Take not her part.
For if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her, Thou shalt aby it.
Now she holds me not.
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right, Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
Follow”?
Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl.
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
Nay, go not back.
I will not trust you, I, Nor longer stay in your curst company.
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray.
My legs are longer though, to run away.
I am amazed and know not what to say.
Or else committ’st thy knaveries willfully.
