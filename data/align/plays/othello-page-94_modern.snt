My God, what a great song!
I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking.
The Danes, the Germans, and the Dutch—come on, drink, drink!—are nothing compared to the English.
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?
They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans.
And the Dutch are vomiting while the English are asking for refills.
Let’s drink to our general!
Hear, hear!
I’ll drink as much as you do!
Oh, sweet England!
God, that song’s even better than the other one.
Do you want to hear it again?
No, because we shouldn’t be doing that—stuff.
Oh well, God’s in charge, and some people have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to hell.
That’s true, lieutenant.
