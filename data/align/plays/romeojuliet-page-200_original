Hang thee, young baggage!
Disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday, Or never after look me in the face.
Speak not.
Reply not.
Do not answer me.
My fingers itch.—Wife, we scarce thought us blest That God had lent us but this only child, But now I see this one is one too much And that we have a curse in having her.
Out on her, hilding!
God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
And why, my Lady Wisdom?
Hold your tongue, Good prudence.
Smatter with your gossips, go.
I speak no treason.
Oh, God 'i' good e'en.
May not one speak?
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip’s bowl, For here we need it not.
You are too hot.
God’s bread!
It makes me mad.
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been To have her matched.
And having now provided A gentleman of noble parentage, Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly trained, Stuffed, as they say, with honorable parts, Proportioned as one’s thought would wish a man— And then to have a wretched puling fool, A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender, To answer “I’ll not wed,” “I cannot love,” “I am too young,” “I pray you, pardon me.”— But, an you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
Look to ’t, think on ’t, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near.
Lay hand on heart, advise.
An you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend.
An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, For, by my soul, I’ll ne'er acknowledge thee, Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
Trust to ’t, bethink you.
I’ll not be forsworn.
