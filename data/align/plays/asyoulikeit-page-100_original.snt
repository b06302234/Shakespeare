If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son, As you have whispered faithfully you were, And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither.
I am the duke That loved your father.
The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me.—Good old man, Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
Support him by the arm.
Give me your hand, And let me all your fortunes understand.
