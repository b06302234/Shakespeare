No, please, lie down, good sirs, because I might change my mind.
Look, Lucius, here’s the book I was searching for.
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown.
I was sure that you hadn’t given it to me.
Bear with me, good boy.
I’ve become very forgetful.
Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute?
Yes, my lord, if you would like.
I would, my boy.
I ask too much of you, but you’re always willing.
It’s my duty, sir.
I shouldn’t make you do more than you’re able.
I know that young men look forward to their rest.
I’ve already slept, my lord.
That was good planning, and you’ll sleep some more.
I won’t keep you very long.
If I live through this, I’ll be good to you.
This is a sleepy tune.
Oh, deadening sleep, have you taken over my boy who plays music for you?
Gentle boy, good night.
I won’t trouble you so much as to wake you.
If you were to droop down, you’d break your instrument, and so I’ll take it from you.
Good night, good boy.
Let me see, let me see.
Didn’t I turn down the page where I left off reading?
Here it is, I think.
This candle doesn’t give much light.
