And the one who commands us is our king.
Wrong-headed slaves, the King of kings says in his Ten Commandments, “Thou shalt not murder.” Will you defy God and obey a man?
Be careful.
God takes revenge on those who break His laws.
He does, and now he’s taking revenge on you—for breaking promises and for murder, too.
You took a holy oath to fight for King Henry VI.
And like a traitor to God, you broke that oath and savagely murdered King Henry’s young son.
Whom you swore you would protect and defend.
How dare you tell us about God’s laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself?
But for whose sake did I do that sick deed?
For my brother Edward’s sake.
He couldn’t be sending you to murder me for that sin, because he’s the one who asked me to commit it.
He is as guilty as I am.
If God will be revenged for this deed, he will do it publicly.
God doesn’t need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him.
