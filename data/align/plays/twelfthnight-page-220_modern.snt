Ah, how awful, I feel so used!
I’ve been tricked!
Who tricked you?
Who treated you badly?
Have you completely forgotten?
Has it been so long?
Call the priest.
Go where, my lord?—Cesario, my husband, stay here.
Husband?
Yes, husband.
Can he deny it?
Are you her husband, boy?
No, my lord, not me.
You’re afraid, so you hide your identity.
But don’t be afraid, Cesario.
Accept the good luck that’s come your way.
Be the person you know you are, and you’ll be as powerful as this person you fear.
Oh, hello, father!
Father, could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man?
I know we wanted to hide it, but now the situation demands that we reveal everything.
