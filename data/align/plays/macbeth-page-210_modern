The noise is coming from over there.
Tyrant, show your face!
If someone other than me kills you, the ghosts of my wife and children will haunt me forever.
I can’t be bothered to fight these lame soldiers who only fight for money.
I’ll either fight you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword unused.
You must be over there.
By the great noise, it sounds like one of the highest-ranking men is being announced.
I hope I find him!
I ask for nothing more than that.
Come this way, my lord.
The castle has been surrendered without a fight.
Macbeth’s soldiers are fighting on both sides.
Our noblemen are battling bravely.
The victory is almost yours, and it seems like there’s not much left to do.
Our enemies fight as if they’re trying not to hurt us.
Sir, enter the castle.
