I can’t, ma'am.
My lady ordered me to deliver her letter.
Why would she write to Edmund?
Couldn’t you just deliver the message orally?
It probably has something to do with… I don’t know.
I’ll be so grateful to you if you let me open that letter.
Ma'am, I’d rather— I know your lady Goneril doesn’t love her husband.
I’m sure of that.
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances.
I know she trusts you and tells you everything.
Me, ma'am?
I know what I’m talking about.
You’re close to her, I know it.
So I recommend you take note of what I’m about to say.
My husband is dead.
Edmund and I have talked, and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril.
You can figure out the rest.
If you find him, please  If I could run into him, ma'am, I’d prove which side I’m on.
Goodbye.
