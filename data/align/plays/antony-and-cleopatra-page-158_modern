Thank you, my lord.
May the god of power make me, the weakest of the weak, your mediator.
A war between you two would split the very world, and the bodies of your slaughtered soldiers would have to fill the chasm between.
When you find out who started this disagreement, turn your anger upon them.
Our faults canâ€™t be so alike that you would judge us similarly.
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions.
Spend as much as you like.
