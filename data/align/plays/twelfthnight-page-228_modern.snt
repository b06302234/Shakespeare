How did you divide yourself in two?
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple.
Which one is Sebastian?
How unbelievable!
I’m from Messaline.
Sebastian was my father’s name, and my brother was named Sebastian too.
He was dressed just like you are when he drowned.
If ghosts can take on someone’s body and clothes, you must be a spirit who’s come to frighten us.
I am a spirit, yes, since I have a soul.
But my spirit has a body attached to it, one that I’ve carried since I was in the womb.
If you were a woman, I’d hug you now and cry, and say “Welcome back, drowned Viola!” My father had a mole on his forehead.
Mine did too.
He died on Viola’s thirteenth birthday.
