Is the chair empty?
Is the sword unswayed?
Is the king dead, the empire unpossessed?
What heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England’s king but great York’s heir?
Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
Unless for that he comes to be your liege, You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.
No, my good lord.
Therefore mistrust me not.
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore, Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?
No, my good lord.
My friends are in the north.
Cold friends to me.
What do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
They have not been commanded, mighty king.
Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave, I’ll muster up my friends and meet your Grace Where and what time your Majesty shall please.
Ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond, But I’ll not trust thee.
