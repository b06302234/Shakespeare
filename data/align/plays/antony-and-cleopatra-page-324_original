If it might please ye— His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted The little “O,” the earth.
Most sovereign creature— His legs bestrid the ocean.
His reared arm Crested the world.
His voice was propertied As all the tunèd spheres, and that to friends.
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, He was as rattling thunder.
For his bounty, There was no winter in ’t, an autumn ’twas That grew the more by reaping.
His delights Were dolphinlike; they showed his back above The element they lived in.
In his livery Walked crowns and crownets.
Realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket.
Cleopatra— Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of?
Gentle madam, no.
You lie up to the hearing of the gods.
But if there be nor ever were one such, It’s past the size of dreaming.
Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy, yet t’ imagine An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy, Condemning shadows quite.
