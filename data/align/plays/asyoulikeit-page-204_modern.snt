We’ll get married at some point, Audrey.
Be patient.
Really, the priest was good enough, no matter what that old guy said.
No, he was wicked and vile.
But Audrey, there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl.
Yes, I know who you’re talking about, but he has no claim on me.
Here comes the man himself.
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin.
Truly, we witty men can’t hold our tongues.
We have to mess with the likes of him, we just can’t help it.
Good evening, Audrey.
Good evening, William.
And good evening to you, sir.
Good evening to you, good friend.
No, no, put your hat back on, put it back on.
No, please, keep your head covered.
How old are you, friend?
