And then tell me why you imprisoned me in a dark house after I followed your instructions perfectly.
You made me look like the biggest fool that anybody ever tricked.
Tell me why you did it.
I’m sorry, Malvolio, but this isn’t my writing, though I admit it looks like mine.
It’s definitely Maria’s handwriting.
Now that I think about it, Maria was the one who first told me you were insane.
That’s when you came in smiling at me, dressed up like the letter said, and acting just like it told you to act.
Someone has played a very mean trick on you, but when we find out who’s responsible, you won’t just be the victim, but the judge who sentences the culprit.
I promise.
Madam, let me say something.
Please don’t let squabbles ruin this beautiful and miraculous moment.
I confess that Toby and I were the ones who tricked Malvolio because we hated his strict and heavy-handed ways.
Sir Toby had Maria wrote that letter, and he married her as a reward.
We should just laugh about the whole thing rather than get upset about it, especially if we consider that each of the two parties offended the other equally.
