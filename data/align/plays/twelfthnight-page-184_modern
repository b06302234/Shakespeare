Are you trying to tell me that I wasn’t sent to get you?
Oh, who cares, you’re acting like a fool.
Leave me alone.
Good for you, holding out on me like this!
No, I don’t know you, and my lady didn’t send me to get you, and I’m not supposed to tell you to come speak with her, and your name is not Master Cesario, and this is not my nose, either.
Nothing is what it is.
Oh please, go somewhere else to blab your nonsense.
You don’t know me.
Blab my nonsense?
He must’ve heard that phrase describing some great man and now he’s using it on a jester.
Blab my nonsense!
What an idiotic place this world is.
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady.
Should I blab to her that you’re coming?
Please, fool, go away.
Here’s money for you.
Well, well.
You’re a generous man.
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation—if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years.
