And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermiaâ€™s flight.
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her.
And for this intelligence If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.
But herein mean I to enrich my pain, To have his sight thither and back again.
