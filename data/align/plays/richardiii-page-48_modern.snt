Brother, you’ve made a mistake.
The king himself noticed your hatred toward my children, my brothers, and myself.
No one had to point it out to him—it’s obvious.
He  I can’t tell what’s going on.
The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost.
Since every peasant has been made into a nobleman, many noblemen have been dragged down to the level of peasants.
Come, come, I know what you’re referring to, Richard.
You resent my friends' rise in society, and my own.
Let’s hope we never need your help for anything.
Meanwhile, we’re the ones who need you.
My brother is imprisoned because of you, I am disgraced, and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren’t worth a dime have suddenly been promoted.
By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy, I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence.
In fact, I’ve always been on his side and have pleaded for him.
My lord, you’re doing me a huge injustice to suggest otherwise.
