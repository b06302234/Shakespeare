Now my spells are all broken, And the only power I have is my own, Which is very weak.
Now you all Have got the power to keep me prisoner here, Or send me off to Naples.
Please don’t Keep me here on this desert island With your magic spells.
Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help.
The gentle wind You blow with your applause Will fill my ship’s sails.
Without applause, My plan to please you has failed.
Now I have no spirits to enslave, No magic to cast spells, And I’ll end up in despair Unless I’m relieved by prayer, Which wins over God himself And absolves all sins.
Just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven, Indulge me, forgive me, and set me free.
