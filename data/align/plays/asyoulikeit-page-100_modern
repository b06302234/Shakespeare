If you really are Sir Rowland’s son, as you’ve just whispered to me—and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face— you are truly welcome here.
I am the duke who loved your father.
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story.—Good old man, you are as welcome here as your master is.
Give him your arm.
Give me your hand, and explain your situation to me.
