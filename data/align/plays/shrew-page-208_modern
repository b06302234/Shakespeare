Then God be praised, it  Petruchio, do whatever you like.
You’ve won.
Well, onward, then.
That’s how things should be—straight and smooth.
But, hang on!
I hear someone coming.
Young budding virgin, fair and pure and sweet, where are you off to?
Or where do you live?
Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child.
And luckier still is the man who gets to be your husband and share your bed.
