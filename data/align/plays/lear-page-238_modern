This is beyond weird.
What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell?
That was a poor unlucky beggar.
From down here, I thought his eyes looked like full moons.
He had a thousand noses and twisted horns, like wave crests in a storm at sea.
It was some devil.
You lucky old man, it seems that the gods have saved your life.
They love to perform miracles so that humans will worship them.
I understand now.
From now on I’ll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out, “Enough, enough!” and disappears.
I thought that thing you’re talking about was a man.
It would often talk about the devil.
It took me to that deadly place.
Cheer up and be at peace.
But who is that?
A sane person would never dress like this.
No, they can’t accuse me of counterfeiting coins.
I’m the king himself.
Life’s better at
