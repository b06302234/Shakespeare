She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
And thus she means, videlicetâ€” Asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?
O Pyramus, arise!
Speak, speak.
Quite dumb?
Dead, dead?
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes.
These lily lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone, are gone.
Lovers, make moan.
His eyes were green as leeks.
O Sisters three, Come, come to me With hands as pale as milk.
Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk.
Tongue, not a word.
Come, trusty sword.
Come, blade, my breast imbrue.
And, farewell, friends.
Thus Thisbe ends.
Adieu, adieu, adieu.
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
Ay, and Wall too.
