If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me.
If thou art privy to thy countryâ€™s fate, Which happily foreknowing may avoid, Oh, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it.
Stay and speak!
Stop it, Marcellus.
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Do, if it will not stand.
Tis here.
Tis here.
Tis gone.
We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence, For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.
It was about to speak when the cock crew.
