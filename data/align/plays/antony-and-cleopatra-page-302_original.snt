And welcome, welcome!
Die when thou hast lived.
Quicken with kissing.
Had my lips that power, Thus would I wear them out.
A heavy sight!
I am dying, Egypt, dying.
Give me some wine and let me speak a little.
No, let me speak, and let me rail so high That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel, Provoked by my offense.
One word, sweet Queen: Of Caesar seek your honor, with your safety—Oh!
They do not go together.
Gentle, hear me.
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
My resolution and my hands I’ll trust, None about Caesar.
The miserable change now at my end Lament nor sorrow at, but please your thoughts In feeding them with those my former fortunes, Wherein I lived the greatest prince o’ th’ world, The noblest, and do now not basely die, Not cowardly put off my helmet to My countryman—a Roman by a Roman Valiantly vanquished.
Now my spirit is going.
I can no more.
