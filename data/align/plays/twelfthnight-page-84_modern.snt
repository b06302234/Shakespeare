Let’s go to bed, knight.
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you.
If I can’t persuade your niece to marry me, I’m going to be in some serious financial trouble.
Get your hands on some money and everything will be all right.
I know you’ll win over Olivia in the end.
I know I will too, if it’s the last thing I do.
Come on, I’ll go warm up a nice glass of sherry for us.
It’s too late to go to bed now.
Come on, my friend, come on.
