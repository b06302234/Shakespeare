For if thou path, thy native semblance on, Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention.
I think we are too bold upon your rest.
Good morrow, Brutus.
Do we trouble you?
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Know I these men that come along with you?
Yes, every man of them, and no man here But honors you, and every one doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you.
This is Trebonius.
He is welcome hither.
This, Decius Brutus.
He is welcome too.
This, Casca.
This, Cinna.
And this, Metellus Cimber.
They are all welcome.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night?
Shall I entreat a word?
