The time to come.
That thou hast wrongèd in the time o'erpast; For I myself have many tears to wash Hereafter time, for time past wronged by thee.
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered, Ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age; The parents live whose children thou hast butchered, Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast Misused ere used, by times ill-used o'erpast.
As I intend to prosper and repent, So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms!
Myself myself confound, Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours, Day, yield me not thy light, nor night thy rest, Be opposite all planets of good luck To my proceedings if, with dear heart’s love, Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.
In her consists my happiness and thine.
Without her follows to myself and thee, Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul, Death, desolation, ruin and decay.
It cannot be avoided but by this; It will not be avoided but by this.
Therefore, dear mother—I must call you so— Be the attorney of my love to her: Plead what I will be, not what I have been; Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.
Urge the necessity and state of times, And be not peevish found in great designs.
