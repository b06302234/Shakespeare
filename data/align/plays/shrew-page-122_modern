The humiliation is all mine.
You forced me to accept this man against my will, this fancy con artist who was in such a hurry to get engaged.
He has no intention of marrying me.
I knew it—I told you.
The whole thing was a joke.
He pretends to be this simple, backward guy, but it’s all a gag to amuse his witty friends.
He goes around proposing to women—they set a date, he gets introduced around, they send out the invitations and make a public announcement, but he has no intention of going through with it.
So now everyone will point at me and say, “Look, there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio—if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing!”
