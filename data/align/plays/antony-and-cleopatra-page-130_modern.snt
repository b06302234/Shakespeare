Are you drunk?
No, Pompey, I haven’t had anything to drink.
You can be the most powerful man on earth if you dare use your power.
Both land and sea are yours if you will take them.
Tell me how.
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat.
Let me cut the anchor cable.
When we are away from land, cut their throats.
Everything that belongs to them is yours.
Oh, you should have done it without telling me!
For me to do such a thing would be dishonorable.
For you to do it would be good service.
You should know that to me, profit isn’t more important than honor, but the other way around.
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions.
If you had acted without my knowledge, I would have approved your action later.
But now I must condemn it.
Give it up and go drink.
