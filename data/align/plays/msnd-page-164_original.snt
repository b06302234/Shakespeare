Now is the mural down between the two neighbors.
No remedy, my lord, when walls are so willful to hear without warning.
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them.
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass for excellent men.
Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
You, ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, May now perchance both quake and tremble here, When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
Then know that I, as Snug the joiner, am A lion fell, nor else no lion’s dam.
For if I should as lion come in strife Into this place, ’twere pity on my life.
A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
A very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
