Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
No, my good lord.
Therefore be patient.
Hastings and Edward’s children, Grey and Rivers, Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward, Vaughan, and all that have miscarrièd By underhand, corrupted, foul injustice, If that your moody, discontented souls Do through the clouds behold this present hour, Even for revenge mock my destruction.— This is All Souls' Day, fellow, is it not?
It is.
Why, then All Souls' Day is my body’s doomsday.
This is the day which, in King Edward’s time, I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife’s allies.
This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him who most I trusted.
This, this All Souls' Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs.
That high All-seer which I dallied with Hath turned my feignèd prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begged in jest.
