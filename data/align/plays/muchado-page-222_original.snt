Is this the monument of Leonato?
It is, my lord.
Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies.
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, Gives her fame which never dies.
So the life that died with shame Lives in death with glorious fame.
Hang thou there upon the tomb, Praising her when I am dumb.
Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
