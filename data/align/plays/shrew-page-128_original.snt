Why, sir, he comes not.
Didst thou not say he comes?
Who?
That Petruchio came?
Ay, that Petruchio came.
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
Why, that’s all one.
Nay, by Saint Jamy, I hold you a penny, A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many.
Come, where be these gallants?
Who’s at home?
You are welcome, sir.
And yet I come not well.
And yet you halt not.
