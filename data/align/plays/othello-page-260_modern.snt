We don’t know.
Didn’t you hear someone shouting?
I’m here, here!
For heaven’s sake, help me!
What’s the matter?
It is.
He’s a good man.
Is that you, Iago?
I’m here, I’ve been destroyed by villains!
Help me.
Oh, lieutenant!
What villains did this to you?
I think one of them is nearby and can’t get away.
The treacherous criminals!— Somebody help me over here!
That’s one of them.
