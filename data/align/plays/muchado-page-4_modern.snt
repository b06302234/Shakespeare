I have delivered some letters to his uncle, and he seemed very happy.
He got so emotional that he actually looked like he was in pain.
Did he start weeping?
Yes, heavily.
That’s a very natural display of affection.
There’s no face more sincere than one washed in tears.
And it’s definitely better to cry because you’re happy than laugh because you’re sad!
Please tell me, has Signior  I don’t know anyone with that name, ma'am.
There was no Signior Montanto in our army.
Who are you talking about, niece?
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
Oh, yes, Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever.
