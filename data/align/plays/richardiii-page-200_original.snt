How now, how now?
What say the citizens?
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord, The citizens are mum, say not a word.
Touched you the bastardy of Edward’s children?
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy And his contract by deputy in France; Th' unsatiate greediness of his desire And his enforcement of the city wives; His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy, As being got, your father then in France, His resemblance being not like the duke.
Withal, I did infer your lineaments, Being the right idea of your father, Both in your form and nobleness of mind; Laid open all your victories in Scotland, Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace, Your bounty, virtue, fair humility; Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose Untouched or slightly handled in discourse.
And when mine oratory grew toward end, I bid them that did love their country’s good Cry “God save Richard, England’s royal king!” And did they so?
