A blessèd labor, my most sovereign lord.
Amongst this princely heap, if any here By false intelligence, or wrong surmise Hold me a foe, If I unwittingly, or in my rage, Have aught committed that is hardly borne By any in this presence, I desire To reconcile me to his friendly peace.
Tis death to me to be at enmity; I hate it, and desire all good men’s love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you, Which I will purchase with my duteous service;— Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham, If ever any grudge were lodged between us;— Of you and you, Lord Rivers and of Dorset, That all without desert have frowned on me;— Of you, Lord Woodeville and Lord Scales;— of you, Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman alive With whom my soul is any jot at odds More than the infant that is born tonight.
I thank my God for my humility.
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
Why, madam, have I offered love for this, To be so flouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?
You do him injury to scorn his corse.
