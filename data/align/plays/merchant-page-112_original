to SOLANIO and SALARINO) Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and desires to speak with you both.
We have been up and down to seek him.
Here comes another of the tribe.
A third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew.
How now, Tubal?
What news from Genoa?
Hast thou found my daughter?
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
Why, there, there, there, there!
A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt—the curse never fell upon our nation till now!
I never felt it till now—Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels.
I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear!
Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin!
No news of them?
Why, so.
And I know not what’s spent in the search.
Why thou, loss upon loss!
The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief—and no satisfaction, no revenge.
Nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o' my shoulders, no sighs but o' my breathing, no tears but o' my shedding.
