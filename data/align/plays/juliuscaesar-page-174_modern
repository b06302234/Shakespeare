You don’t love me.
I don’t like your faults.
A friend would never see those faults.
No, a flatterer wouldn’t, even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus.
Come, Antony and young Octavius!
Get your revenge on Cassius, because Cassius has grown tired of the world.
He’s hated by someone he loves, defied by his brother, rebuked like a servant, all his faults observed, catalogued in a notebook, read, and committed to memory so they can be thrown in his face.
Oh, I could weep my soul right out of myself!
There’s my dagger  Put away your dagger.
Be angry whenever you like, it’s all right with me.
Do whatever you want, and I’ll say your insults are just a bad mood.
Oh, Cassius, you’re partners with a quiet lamb.
My anger is like a flint striking—a brief spark, and then I’m cold again.
