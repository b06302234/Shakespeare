I know a discontented gentleman Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
Gold were as good as twenty orators, And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.
What is his name?
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
I partly know the man.
Go, call him hither, boy   No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels Hath he so long held out with me, untired, And stops he now for breath?
Well, be it so.
How now, Lord Stanley, what’s the news?
Know, my long lord, The marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.
Come hither, Catesby.
Rumor it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick.
I will take order for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman, Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter.
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look how thou dream’st!
I say again, give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die.
About it, for it stands me much upon To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
