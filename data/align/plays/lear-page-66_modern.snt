This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks.
I’m asking you to understand my point of view.
Since you’re old and respected, you should be wise.
But you’re keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly, vulgar, and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel.
They’re such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we’re living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace.
It’s shameful, and we have to make some changes right away.
Please, as a favor to me—and if you don’t do it for me, I’ll do it myself—reduce the number of your knights a little.
Keep the ones who are older, like you, and who act their age.
Hell and damnation!
Saddle up my horses.
Call my knights together.
I won’t bother you any more, you monstrous bastard.
You’re not really my daughter, but I still have one daughter left.
You hit my servants, and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants.
You’ll be sorry later, but it’ll be too late.
