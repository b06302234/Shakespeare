If you want to fight, I’m your man.
My employer is as good as yours.
But he’s not better than mine.
Well then.
You lie.
Pull out your swords, if you’re men.
Gregory, remember how to slash.
What?
You’ve pulled out your sword to fight with these worthless servants?
Turn around, Benvolio, and look at the man who’s going to kill you.
