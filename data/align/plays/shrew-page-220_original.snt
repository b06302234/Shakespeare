Prithee, Kate, letâ€™s stand aside and see the end of this controversy.
What am I, sir!
Nay, what are you, sir?
O immortal gods!
O fine villain!
A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak, and a copatain hat!
Oh, I am undone, I am undone!
While I play the good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the university.
What, is the man lunatic?
Thy father!
O villain!
He is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
