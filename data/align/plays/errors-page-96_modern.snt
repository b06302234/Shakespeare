Have some patience, please.
I cannot and I will not keep quiet.
My voice will have its way, even if my heart can’t.
He is misshapen, crooked, old, and withered.
His face is ugly, and his body is even worse—all shapeless, everywhere.
He is vicious, mean, foolish, blunt, unkind.
His body is deformed, and his mind is worse.

When an evil thing has been lost, no one cries.
Oh, but I think of him more highly than I say I do—and I wish he looked worse in other women’s eyes.
I’m like a lapwing, creating a diversion in order to distract predators from my nest.
My heart adores him, even though my tongue curses him.

The desk!
Money!
Come on, now!
Hurry!
How did you lose your breath?
By running fast.
Where’s your master, Dromio?
Is he all right?
No, he’s in a place worse than hell.
A devil in a tough uniform has him—a man whose heart is as hard as steel.
A fiend and a goblin, pitiless and rough.
A wolf—no, even worse—a man all in tough leather.
A backbiting friend, one who grabs people, who patrols the streets and passageways.
A hunting dog that runs in
