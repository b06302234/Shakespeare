The law fully authorizes the penalty, which you have to pay according to the contract.
Very true.
Oh wise judge!
You’re so much older than you look!
Yes, his chest!
That’s what the contract says, doesn’t it, judge?
Nearest his heart.”—Those are the very words.
Yes.
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh?
I have it ready.
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds, Shylock, so he doesn’t bleed to death.
Is that called for in the contract?
Not explicitly, but so what?
It wouldn’t hurt you to be charitable.
I can’t find it.
It’s not in the contract.
Not much.
I’m ready and waiting.—Give me your hand, Bassanio.
Goodbye.
