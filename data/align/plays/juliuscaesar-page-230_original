Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
Statilius showed the torchlight but, my lord, He came not back.
He is or ta'en or slain.
Sit thee down, Clitus.
Slaying is the word.
It is a deed in fashion.
Hark thee, Clitus.
What, I, my lord?
No, not for all the world.
Peace then!
No words.
Iâ€™ll rather kill myself.
Hark thee, Dardanius.
Shall I do such a deed?
O Dardanius!
O Clitus!
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
To kill him, Clitus.
Look, he meditates.
