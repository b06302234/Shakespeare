Let’s start.
See, Beatrice has run over like a little bird, keeping close to the ground and trying to overhear us.
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much?
That’s what the Prince and my fiancé say.
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this, madam?
They did want me to tell her, but I persuaded them that, if they truly loved Benedick, they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark.
Why did you do that?
Doesn’t Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice?
