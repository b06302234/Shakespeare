Well met, Corporal Nym.
Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
For my part, I care not.
I say little, but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as it may.
I dare not fight, but I will wink and hold out mine iron.
It is a simple one, but what though?
It will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another man’s sword will, and there’s an end.
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and we’ll be all three sworn brothers to France.
Let ’t be so, good Corporal Nym.
Faith, I will live so long as I may, that’s the certain of it.
And when I cannot live any longer, I will do as I may.
That is my rest; that is the rendezvous of it.
It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you were troth-plight to her.
I cannot tell.
Things must be as they may.
Men may sleep, and they may have their throats about them at that time, and some say knives have edges.
It must be as it may.
Though patience be a tired mare, yet she will plod.
There must be conclusions.
Well, I cannot tell.
