My mind hath been as big as one of yours, My heart as great, my reason haply more, To bandy word for word and frown for frown.
But now I see our lances are but straws, Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot, And place your hands below your husband’s foot: In token of which duty, if he please, My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
Why, there’s a wench!
Come on and kiss me, Kate.
Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha ’t.
Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.
Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white, And, being a winner, God give you good night!
Now, go thy ways, thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
