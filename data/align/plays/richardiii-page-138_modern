How’s the prince?
He’s fine and healthy, madam.
What is your news?
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey have been imprisoned in  Who sent them there?
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham.
What did they do wrong?
I’ve told you everything I know.
Why the nobles were imprisoned, and on what charges, I don’t know, my gracious lord.
Oh no!
I see the downfall of my family.
The tiger has seized the gentle deer: a tyrant has begun to attack the weak, innocent king.
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!
I can see how all this will end as clearly as if I was looking at a map.
