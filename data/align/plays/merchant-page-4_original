My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
I should not see the sandy hourglass run, But I should think of shallows and of flats And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand, Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial.
Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side, Would scatter all her spices on the stream, Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, And, in a word, but even now worth this, And now worth nothing?
Shall I have the thought To think on this, and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
But tell not me.
I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
Believe me, no.
I thank my fortune for it— My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, Nor to one place, nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year.
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
Why then, you are in love.
Fie, fie!
Not in love neither?
Then let us say you are sad Because you are not merry—and ’twere as easy For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry Because you are not sad.
Now, by two-headed Janus, Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time.
