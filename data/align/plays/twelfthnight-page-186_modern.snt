Well, sir, we meet again?
Take that.
Stop right now or I’ll throw your dagger over the roof.
No, leave him alone.
I’ll get back at him another way.
I’ll sue him for assault and battery, if there’s any justice in Illyria.
It doesn’t matter that I hit him first.
No, sir, I won’t let you go.
Come on, put your sword away, my little soldier.
You’re awfully eager to fight.
Come on.
I’ll get free of you.
