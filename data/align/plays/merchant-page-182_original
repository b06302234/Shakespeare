For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty, Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
Tis very true.
O wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!

Tis not in the bond.
But little.
I am armed and well prepared.— Give me your hand, Bassanio.
Fare you well.
