Where is the king?
The king rode out alone to view their troops.
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men.
That’s five to one.
Besides, they’re fresh.
May God’s arm strike on our side!
These are frightening odds.
God be with all of you, princes.
I’ll go and join my men.
If we don’t meet again before we meet in heaven, still we’ll meet joyfully.
My noble Lord of Bedford, my dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter, and my kind kinsmen, warriors all, adieu.
Farewell, good Salisbury; and may good luck go with you.
Farewell, kind lord.
Fight valiantly today.
But then I do you wrong to say as much, since you are the very embodiment of bravery.
He is as full of courage as of kindness, princely in both.
