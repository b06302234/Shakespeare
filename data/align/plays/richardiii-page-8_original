I beseech your Graces both to pardon me.
His majesty hath straitly given in charge That no man shall have private conference, Of what degree soever, with his brother.
Even so.
An please your Worship, Brakenbury, You may partake of anything we say.
We speak no treason, man.
We say the king Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.
We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot, A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue, And that the queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.
How say you, sir?
Can you deny all this?
With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
Naught to do with Mistress Shore?
I tell thee, fellow, He that doth naught with her, excepting one, Were best he do it secretly, alone.
What one, my lord?
Her husband, knave.
Wouldst thou betray me?
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
