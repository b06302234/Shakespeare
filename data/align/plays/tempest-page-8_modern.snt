What, we’re going to die?
The king and the prince are praying.
Let’s go join them, since whatever happens to them happens to us too.
I’m out of patience.
Yes, we’ve been cheated out of our lives by a bunch of drunken, incompetent sailors.
This bigmouth jerk here—( He’ll still die by hanging, not drowning, even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him.
God have mercy on us!—The ship’s breaking up!—Goodbye, wife and kids!—Goodbye, brother!—We’re breaking up, we’re breaking up!
Let’s all sink with the king.
Let’s say goodbye to him.
