I do confess my fault, And do submit me to Your Highness' mercy.
To which we all appeal.
The mercy that was quick in us but late By your own counsel is suppressed and killed.
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy, For your own reasons turn into your bosoms, As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
See you, my princes and my noble peers, These English monsters.
My Lord of Cambridge here, You know how apt our love was to accord To furnish him with all appurtenants Belonging to his honor, and this man Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired, And sworn unto the practices of France, To kill us here in Hampton; to the which This knight, no less for bounty bound to us Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.—But Oh, What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel, Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels, That knew’st the very bottom of my soul, That almost mightst have coined me into gold, Wouldst thou have practiced on me for thy use— May it be possible that foreign hire Could out of thee extract one spark of evil That might annoy my finger?
Tis so strange That, though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
Treason and murder ever kept together As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose, Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them.
