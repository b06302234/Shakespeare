O me!
You thief of love!
What, have you come by night And stol'n my love’s heart from him?
Fine, i' faith!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, No touch of bashfulness?
What, will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?

Puppet”?
Why so?—Ay, that way goes the game.
Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures.
She hath urged her height, And with her personage, her tall personage, Her height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him.— And are you grown so high in his esteem Because I am so dwarfish and so low?

How low am I?

I have no gift at all in shrewishness.
I am a right maid for my cowardice.
Let her not strike me.
You perhaps may think, Because she is something lower than myself, That I can match her.
