Oh, I remember that very clearly!
It’s true, he died on the day my sister turned thirteen.
If the only thing keeping us from rejoicing is the fact that I’m wearing men’s clothes, then don’t hug me till I can prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that I’m Viola.
I’ll take you to a sea captain here in town who’s got my women’s clothing in storage.
He saved my life so I could serve this noble count.
Everything that’s happened to me since then has involved my relationship with this lady and this lord.
Everything I said before I’ll say again.
I swear I meant every word.
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman’s clothing.
