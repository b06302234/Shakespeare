Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home?
He’d left some unfinished business, which he remembered after arriving here.
It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence.
Whom did he leave in charge here?
The marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered?
Yes, sir.
She took the letters and read them in front of me.
Now and then a large tear trickled down her delicate cheek.
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions, which were overwhelming her.
So she was moved by it?
There were no outbursts.
She was struggling between emotion and self-control.
You’ve seen how it can rain while the sun shines?
That’s how she was, smiling and crying at once, only more lovely.
The little smile on her full lips didn’t seem aware of the tears that were dropping like diamonds from her pearly eyes.
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow, then sorrow would be highly prized.
