You’re doing too much to defend a woman who wants nothing to do with you.
Leave Hermia alone.
Don’t talk about Helena.
Don’t take Helena’s side.
If you continue treating Hermia so badly, you’ll pay for it.
Hermia’s not holding onto me anymore.
Follow me if you’re brave enough, and we’ll fight over Helena.
Follow”?
No, I’ll walk right next to you, side by side.
All this fighting is because of you.
Stay where you are.
I’m not sticking around here any more.
I don’t trust you.
You might be a better fighter than I am, but my legs are longer and I can run away faster.
I just can’t believe any of this.
I don’t know what to say.
