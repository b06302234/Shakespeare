Then I salute you with this royal title: Long live Richard, Englandâ€™s worthy king!
Amen.
Tomorrow will it please you to be crowned?
Even when you please, since you will have it so.
Tomorrow, then, we will attend your Grace, And so most joyfully we take our leave.
Farewell, my cousin.
Farewell, gentle friends.
