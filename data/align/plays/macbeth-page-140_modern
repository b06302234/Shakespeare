Don’t try to find out more.
I demand to be satisfied.
If you refuse, let an eternal curse fall on you.
Let me know.
Why is that cauldron sinking?
And what is that music?
Show.
Show.
Show.
Show him and make him grieve.
Come like shadows and depart in the same way!
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo.
Go away!
