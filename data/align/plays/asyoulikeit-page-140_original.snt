Come apace, good Audrey.
I will fetch up your goats, Audrey.
And how, Audrey?
Am I the man yet?
Doth my simple feature content you?
Your features, Lord warrant us!
What features?
I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
When a man’s verses cannot be understood nor a man’s good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.
Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
I do not know what “poetical” is.
Is it honest in deed and word?
Is it a true thing?
No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest.
Now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.
