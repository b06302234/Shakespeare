Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth Do all expect that you should rouse yourself As did the former lions of your blood.
They know your Grace hath cause and means and might; So hath your Highness.
Never king of England Had nobles richer, and more loyal subjects, Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear liege, With blood and sword and fire to win your right, In aid whereof we of the spiritualty Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestors.
We must not only arm t' invade the French, But lay down our proportions to defend Against the Scot, who will make road upon us With all advantages.
They of those marches, gracious sovereign, Shall be a wall sufficient to defend Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only, But fear the main intendment of the Scot, Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us.
For you shall read that my great-grandfather Never went with his forces into France But that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdom Came pouring like the tide into a breach With ample and brim fullness of his force, Galling the glean√®d land with hot assays, Girding with grievous siege castles and towns, That England, being empty of defense, Hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighborhood.
