On the battlefield, he puts himself in front of the cannon’s mouth, risking his life to seek fame that is as fleeting as a soap bubble.
In the fifth act, he is a judge, with a nice fat belly from all the bribes he’s taken.
His eyes are stern, and he’s given his beard a respectable cut.
He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part.
In the sixth act, the curtain rises on a skinny old man in slippers, glasses on his nose and a money bag at his side.
The stockings he wore in his youth hang loosely on his shriveled legs now, and his bellowing voice has shrunk back down to a childish squeak.
In the last scene of our play—the end of this strange, eventful history—our hero, full of forgetfulness, enters his second childhood: without teeth, without eyes, without taste, without everything.
Welcome.
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat.
I thank you very much on his behalf.
You had better do that.
I can barely speak to thank you myself.
Welcome.
Eat.
I won’t trouble you yet with questions about your situation.—Some music, please, and, good friend, sing.
