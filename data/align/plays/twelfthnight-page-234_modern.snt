I will, my lady, but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy.
So listen up, princess.
I swear to God, madam, you’ve wronged me, and I’ll tell the whole world.
You’ve shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me, but I’m as sane as you are.
I’ve got a letter from you encouraging me to act the way I did.
If I didn’t have it, I couldn’t prove that I’m right and you’re wrong.
I don’t care what you think of me.
I’m going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you’ve caused me.
Signed,    The poorly treated Malvolio.” Did he write this?
Yes, madam.
It doesn’t sound like an insane person’s letter.
Set him free.
Fabian, bring him here.
My lord, I hope that after you think things over a bit you’ll come to like the idea of having me as a sister-in-law instead of a wife.
We can have the weddings tomorrow if you want, here at my own house.
I’ll pay for everything.
