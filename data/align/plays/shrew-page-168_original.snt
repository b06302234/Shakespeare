Mistake no more.
I am not Litio, Nor a musician as I seem to be, But one that scorn to live in this disguise For such a one as leaves a gentlema And makes a god of such a cullion.
Know, sir, that I am called Hortensio.
Of your entire affection to Bianca, And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness, I will with you, if you be so contented, Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
See how they kiss and court!
Signior Lucentio, Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow Never to woo her more, but do forswear her As one unworthy all the former favors That I have fondly flattered her withal.
And here I take the like unfeign√®d oath Never to marry with her, though she would entreat.
Fie on her!
See how beastly she doth court him!
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath, I will be married to a wealthy widow, Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, Shall win my love, and so I take my leave, In resolution as I swore before.
