I’ve killed many men in battle, but I still believe it’s deeply wrong to murder someone.
Sometimes I worry I’m not cruel enough for this job.
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs.
It’s better that you didn’t kill him.

The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will.
No one knows this yet—and I don’t like to brag, but I come from a royal family, and I’m as noble as the woman I’ve married.
And let me tell you, Iago, if I didn’t love Desdemona as much as I do, I’d never agree to get married and lose my freedom at all.
But look at those lights.
Who’s coming?
