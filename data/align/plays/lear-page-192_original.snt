And false.
Where hast thou sent the king?
To Dover.
Wherefore to Dover?
Wast thou not charged at peril— Wherefore to Dover?—Let him first answer that.
I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.
Wherefore to Dover, sir?
Because I would not see thy cruèl nails Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head In hell-black night endured, would have buoyed up, And quenched the stellèd fires.
Yet poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time, Thou shouldst have said, “Good porter, turn the key,” All cruèls else subscribed.
But I shall see The wingèd vengeance overtake such children.
See” ’t shalt thou never.—Fellows, hold the chair.— Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.
He that will think to live till he be old, Give me some help!
