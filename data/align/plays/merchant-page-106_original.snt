Now, what news on the Rialto?
Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the narrow seas.
The Goodwins I think they call the place—a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word.
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband.
But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—oh, that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!—  Come, the full stop.
Ha, what sayest thou?
Why, the end is he hath lost a ship.
I would it might prove the end of his losses.
Let me say “Amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
