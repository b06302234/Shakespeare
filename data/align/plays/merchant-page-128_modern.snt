A nice message.
My lady, with your permission, this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss.
But I’m in a daze, like someone who’s just won a contest and thinks that all the applause and cheering is for him, but isn’t sure yet.
And so, beautiful lady, I’m standing here just like that, wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is.
You see me standing here, Lord Bassanio.
What you see is what you get.
Though I wouldn’t wish to be better for my own sake, for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself—a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer—just so you might value me more, so my good qualities, beauty, possessions, and friends would be more than you could calculate.
What you’re getting is an innocent and inexperienced girl.
I’m happy that at least I’m not too old to learn new things.
I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and I can learn.
I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and you can guide me as you wish.
Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you.
Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion, master of these servants, and queen over myself.
But as of right this second all these things are yours.
With this ring I give them all to you.
