Speak plainly, make your meaning clear, my son.
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution.
I love rich Capulet’s daughter.
I love her, and she loves me.
We’re bound to each other in every possible way, except we need you to marry us.
I’ll tell you more later about when and where we met, how we fell in love, and how we exchanged promises, but now I’m begging you: please, agree to marry us today.
Holy Saint Francis, this is a drastic change!
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline, whom you loved so much?
Then young men love with their eyes, not with their hearts.
Jesus and Mary, how many tears did you cry for Rosaline?
How many salty tear-drops did you waste salting a love you never tasted?
The sun hasn’t yet melted away the fog you made with all your sighs.
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears.
There’s still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn’t been washed off yet.
If you were ever yourself, and this sadness was yours, you and your sadness were all for Rosaline.
And now you’ve changed?
Then repeat this after me: you can’t expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable.
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline.
I scolded you for obsessing about her, not for loving her, my student.
And you told me to bury my love.
I didn’t tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another.
Please, I beg you, don’t scold me.
The girl I love now returns my love.
The other girl did not love me.
Oh, she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means.
But come on, inconsistent young man, come with me.
I’ll help you with your secret wedding.
This marriage may be lucky enough to turn the hatred between your families into pure love.
Let’s get out of here.
I’m in a rush.
Go wisely and slowly.
Those who rush stumble and fall.
Where the devil can Romeo be?
Didn’t he come home last night?
Not to his father’s house.
I asked a servant.
That fair-skinned, hard-hearted hussy, Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane.
Tybalt, old Capulet’s nephew, has sent a letter to Romeo’s father’s house.
I bet it’s a challenge.
Romeo will answer the challenge.
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter.
No, Romeo will respond to the letter’s writer, telling him whether he accepts the challenge.
Oh, poor Romeo!
He’s already dead.
He’s been stabbed by a white girl’s black eye.
He’s been cut through the ear with a love song.
The center of his heart has been split by blind Cupid’s arrow.
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt?
Why, what’s Tybalt’s story?
He’s tougher than the 
He knows what?
I hate these crazy, affected guys who use foreign phrases and newfangled expressions.
I hate their strange manners and their weird accents!
I hate it when they say, “By Jesus, this is a very good blade, a very brave man, a very good whore.” Isn’t this a sad thing, my good man?
Why should we put up with these foreign buzzards, these fashionmongers, these guys who say “pardon me,” these guys who care so much about manners that they can’t kick back on a bench without whining?
Oh, my aching bones!” Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!
He looks skinny, like a dried herring without its eggs, and he hasn’t got his girl.
O flesh, flesh, you’ve turned pale and weak like a fish.
Now he’s ready for 
Good morning to you both.
What do you mean I faked you out?
You gave us the slip, sir, the slip.
Can’t you understand what I’m saying?
Excuse me, good Mercutio.
I had very important business to take care of.
It was so important that I had to forget about courtesy and good manners.
In other words “important business” made you  You mean do a curtsy?
You’ve hit the  That’s a very polite and courteous explanation.
Yes, I am the pink flower—the master, of courtesy and manners.
The  Right.
If you want to fight, I’m your man.
My employer is as good as yours.
But he’s not better than mine.
Well then.
You lie.
Pull out your swords, if you’re men.
Gregory, remember how to slash.
What?
You’ve pulled out your sword to fight with these worthless servants?
Turn around, Benvolio, and look at the man who’s going to kill you.
Well, then my  Alright my witty friend, this joke has worn out your pump.
Its thin skin is all worn out.
The joke is all you have left.
This is a bad joke.
It’s all silliness.
Come break this up, Benvolio.
I’m losing this duel of wits.
Keep going, keep going, or I’ll declare myself the winner.
Now, if our jokes go on a wild-goose chase, I’m finished.
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine.
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose?
You were never with me for anything if you weren’t there for the goose.
I’ll bite you on the ear for that joke.
No, good goose, don’t bite me.
Your joke is a very bitter apple.
Your humor is a spicy sauce.
Then isn’t it just the right dish for a sweet goose?
Oh, that’s a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin, from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard.
I stretch my joke for that word “fat.” If you add that word to the word “goose,” it shows that you are a fat goose.
Why, isn’t all this joking better than groaning about love?
Now you’re sociable.
Now you’re Romeo.
Now you are what you’ve learned to be and what you are naturally.
This love of yours was like a blithering idiot who runs up and down looking for a hole to hide his  Stop there, stop there.
You want me to stop my  Otherwise your tale would have gotten too long.
Oh, you’re wrong.
I would have made it short.
I had come to the deepest part of my tale, and I planned to say nothing more on the topic.
Here’s something good.
There’s two—a man and a woman.
Peter!
I’m at your service.
Give me my fan, Peter.
Good Peter, give her her fan to hide her face.
Her fan is prettier than her face.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good afternoon, fair lady.
Is it now afternoon?
It’s not earlier than that, I tell you.
The  Get out of here!
What kind of man are you?
I’m a man, my lady, that God has made for himself to ruin.
I swear, you speak the truth.
For himself to ruin,” he says.
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo?
I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him.
I am the youngest man by that name, because there is no one younger, or worse.
You speak well.
Is the worst well?
Very well taken, I believe, very wise.
She will  A pimp!
A pimp!
A pimp!
I’ve found it out.
What have you found out?
She’s not a prostitute unless she’s using her ugliness to hide her promiscuity.
Romeo, are you going to your father’s for lunch?
Let’s go there.
I’ll follow after you.
Please tell me, sir, who was that foulmouthed punk who was so full of crude jokes?
Nurse, he’s a man who likes to hear the sound of his own voice.
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month.
If he says anything against me, I’ll humble him, even if he were stronger than he is—and twenty punks like him.
If I can’t do it myself, I’ll find someone who can.
That dirty rat!
I’m not one of his sluts.
I’m not one of his punk friends who carries a knife.
I didn’t see anybody use you for kicks.
If I had seen something like that, I would have quickly pulled out my weapon.
Believe me, I’ll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side.
Now, I swear, I’m so angry that I’m shaking all over.
That rotten scoundrel! 
Nurse, give my regards to to your lady.
I swear to you— You have a good heart, and believe me, I’ll tell her that.
Lord, Lord, she’ll be a happy woman.
What are you going to tell her, Nurse?
You’re not paying attention to me.
Sir, I’ll tell her that you  Tell her to devise a plan to get out of her house and come to confession at the abbey this afternoon.
At Friar Lawrence’s cell she can make confession and be married.
No, really, I won’t take a penny.
Go on, I insist you take it.
Wait good Nurse.
Within an hour, one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder.
I’ll use the rope ladder to climb over the walls at night.
Then I’ll meet Juliet joyfully and in secret.
Goodbye.
Be honest and helpful, and I’ll repay you for your efforts.
Goodbye.
Sing my praises to your mistress.
May God in heaven bless you.
Now please listen, sir.
What do you have to say, my dear Nurse?
Can your man keep a secret?
Haven’t you ever heard the saying, “Two can conspire to put one away”?
I assure you, my man is as true as steel.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.
Lord, Lord, when she was a little baby—Oh, there is one nobleman in the city, a guy named Paris, who would be happy to claim her as his own.
Juliet would rather look at a toad than at him.
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are.
But when I say so, I swear she turns white as a sheet.
Don’t “ Yes, Nurse, what about that?
They both begin with the letter “R.” Ah, you jokester—that’s the dog’s name.
R” is for the—no, I know it begins with another letter.
She says the most beautiful things about you and rosemary.
It would be good for you to hear the things she says.
Give my compliments to your lady.
Yes, a thousand times.
Peter!
I’m ready.  
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock.
Maybe she can’t find him.
That can’t be.
Oh, she’s slow!
Love’s messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams.
They should be strong enough to push shadows over the dark hills.
That’s the way doves carry Venus so fast, and that’s why Cupid has wings that let him fly as fast as the wind.
Now it’s noon.
That’s three hours since nine o'clock, but she hasn’t come back.
If she was young and passionate, she’d move as fast as a ball.
My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me.
But a lot of old people act like they’re already dead—sluggish, slow, fat, and colorless, like lead.
Oh my God, here she comes!
Oh sweet Nurse, what news do you bring?
Have you spoken to him?
Send your man away.
Peter, wait for me at the gate.
Now, good sweet Nurse—Oh Lord, why do you look so sad?
Even if the news is sad, tell me with a smile on your face.
If the news is good, you’re ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that.
I am tired.
Leave me alone for a minute.
Oh my, my bones ache so much.
I’ve been running all over the place.
I wish you had my bones, and I had your news.
Come on now, I beg you, speak, good Nurse, speak.
Sweet Jesus, you’re in such a hurry!
Can’t you wait for a moment?
Don’t you see that I’m out of breath?
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you’re out of breath?
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself.
Is the news good or bad?
Answer that question.
Tell me if it’s good or bad, and I’ll wait for the details.
Tell me so I can be satisfied.
Is it good or bad?
Well, you have made a foolish choice.
You don’t know how to pick a man.
Romeo?
No, not him, though his face is more handsome than any man’s, and his legs are prettier, and as for his hands and feet and body, they’re not much to speak of, and yet they’re beyond compare.
He’s not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he’s gentle as a lamb.
Well, do what you want.
Be good.
Have you had lunch yet?
No, I haven’t had lunch.
Everything you told me I already knew.
What does he say about our marriage?
What about that?
Lord, what a headache I’ve got!
My head is pounding.
It feels like it’ll break into twenty pieces.
My back aches too—
Believe me, I’m sorry you’re in pain.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what did my love Romeo say?
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, who is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I believe, virtuous— where is your mother?
Where is my mother?
Why, she’s inside.
Where else would she be?
Your answer is so strange!
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, 'Where is your mother?
Oh holy Mary, mother of God!
Are you this impatient?
Come on, you’re being ridiculous!
Is this the cure for my aching bones?
From now on, take care of your messages yourself.
You’re making such a fuss.
Come on, what did Romeo say?
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today?
I do.
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
There’s a husband there who’s waiting to make you his wife.
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks.
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news.
Go to the church.
I must go by a different path to get a rope ladder.
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it’s dark.
I do the drudge work for your pleasure.
But soon you’ll be doing a wife’s work all night long.
Go.
I’ll go to lunch.
You go to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
I’m only trying to keep the peace.
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight.
What?
You take out your sword and then talk about peace?
I hate the word peace like I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.
Let’s go at it, coward!
Use your clubs and spears!
Hit them!
Beat them down!
Down with the Capulets!
Down with the Montagues!
What’s this noise?
Give me my long sword!
Come on!
A crutch, you need a crutch—why are you asking for a sword?
I want my sword.
Old Montague is here, and he’s waving his sword around just to make me mad.
Capulet, you villain!
You’re not taking one step toward an enemy.
Wish me luck.
Thank you, dear Nurse.
May the heavens be happy with this holy act of marriage, so nothing unfortunate happens later to make us regret it.
Amen, amen.
But whatever misfortunes occur, they can’t ruin the joy I feel with one look at her.
All you have to do is join our hands with holy words, then love-destroying death can do whatever it pleases.
It’s enough for me if I can call her mine.
These sudden joys have sudden endings.
They burn up in victory like fire and gunpowder.
When they meet, as in a kiss, they explode.
Too much honey is delicious, but it makes you sick to your stomach.
Therefore, love each other in moderation.
That is the key to long-lasting love.
Too fast is as bad as too slow.
Here comes the lady.
Oh,a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life.
Lovers are so light they can walk on a spiderweb floating on a summer breeze, and yet not fall.
That’s how flimsy and unreal pleasure is.
Good evening, my spiritual confessor.
Romeo will thank you, my girl, for both of us.
I’ll give him equal thanks, so we’re even.
Ah, Juliet if you’re as happy as I am, and you’re better with words, tell me about the happiness you imagine we’ll have in our marriage.
I can imagine more than I can say—I have more on my mind than words.
Anyone who can count how much he has is poor.
My true love has made me so rich that I can’t count even half of my wealth.
Come, come with me, and we’ll do the job quickly.
Because if you don’t mind, I’m not leaving you two alone until you’re united in marriage.
I’m begging you, good Mercutio, let’s call it a day.
It’s hot outside, and the Capulets are wandering around.
If we bump into them, we’ll certainly get into a fight.
When it’s hot outside, people become angry and hot-blooded.
You’re like one of those guys who walks into a bar, slams his sword on the table, and then says, “I pray I never have to use you.” By the time he orders his second drink, he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all.
Am I really like one of those guys?
Come on, you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you’re in the mood.
When someone does the smallest thing to make you angry, you get angry.
And when you’re in the mood to get angry, you find something to get angry about.
And what about that?
If there were two men like you, pretty soon there’d be none because the two of you would kill each other.
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard.
You’ll fight with a man who’s cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes.
Only you would look for a fight like that.
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk, but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting.
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun.
Didn’t you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season?
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces?
And yet you’re the one who wants to teach me about restraint!
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are, my life insurance rates would be sky high.
Your life insurance?
That’s foolish.
Oh great, here come the Capulets.
Well, well, I don’t care.
You just want one word with one of us?
Put it together with something else.
Make it a word and a blow.
You’ll find me ready enough to do that, sir, if you give me a reason.
Can’t you find a reason without my giving you one?
Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo.
Hang out?” Who do you think we are, musicians in a band?
If we look like musicians to you, you can expect to hear nothing but noise.
We’re talking here in a public place.
Either go someplace private, or talk it over rationally, or else just go away.
Out here everybody can see us.
Men’s eyes were made to see things, so let them watch.
I won’t move to please anybody.
Well, may peace be with you.
Here comes my man, the man I’m looking for.
He’s not your man.
Alright, walk out into a field, and he’ll chase you.
In that sense you can call him your “man.” Romeo, there’s only one thing I can call you.
You’re a villain.
Tybalt, I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult.
I am no villain.
So, goodbye.
I can tell that you don’t know who I am.
Boy, your words can’t excuse the harm you’ve done to me.
So now turn and draw your sword.
I disagree.
I’ve never done you harm.
I love you more than you can understand until you know the reason why I love you.
And so, good Capulet—which is a name I love like my own name—you should be satisfied with what I say.
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile.
The thrust of a sword will end this surrender.
What do you want from me?
Good King of Cats, I want to take one of your nine lives.
I’ll take one, and, depending on how you treat me after that, I might beat the other eight out of you too.
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath?
Hurry up, or I’ll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn.
I’ll fight you.
Noble Mercutio, put your sword away.    
Let’s get away, Tybalt.
I’ve been hurt.
May a plague curse both your families.
I’m finished.
Did he get away clean?
What, are you hurt?
Yes, yes.
It’s a scratch, just a scratch.
But it’s enough.
Where is my page?
Go, boy.
Get me a doctor.
Have courage, man.
The wound can’t be that bad.
No, it’s not as deep as a well, or as wide as a church door, but it’s enough.
It’ll do the job.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you’ll find me in a grave.
I’m done for in this world, I believe.
May a plague strike both your houses.
Goddammit!
I can’t believe that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat could scratch me to death!
That braggart, punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual!
Why the hell did you come in between us?
He struck me from under your arm.
I thought it was the right thing to do.
Take me inside some house, Benvolio, or I’ll pass out.
May a plague strike both your families!
They’ve turned me into food for worms.
I’m done for.
Curse your families!
This gentleman Mercutio, a close relative of the Prince and my dear friend, was killed while defending me from Tybalt’s slander—Tybalt, who had been my cousin for a whole hour!
Oh, sweet Juliet, your beauty has made me weak like a woman, and you have softened my bravery, which before was as hard as steel.
Oh Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
His brave spirit has floated up to heaven, but it was too early for him to leave life on earth.
The future will be affected by today’s terrible events.
Today is the start of a terror that will end in the days ahead.
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
He’s alive and victorious, and Mercutio’s dead?
Enough with mercy and consideration.
It’s time for rage to guide my actions.
Now, Tybalt, you can call me “villain” the way you did before.
Mercutio’s soul is floating right above our heads.
He’s waiting for you to keep him company on the way up to heaven.
Either you, or I, or both of us have to go with him.
Wretched boy, you hung out with him here, and you’re going to go to heaven with him.
This fight will decide who dies.
Romeo, get out of here.
The citizens are around, and Tybalt is dead.
Don’t stand there shocked.
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught.
So get out of here!
Oh, I have awful luck.
Why are you waiting?
The man who killed Mercutio, which way did he go?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?
Tybalt is lying over there.  
Who started this old fight up again?
Speak, nephew.
Were you here when it started?
Where are the evil men who started this fight?
Oh, noble prince, I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight.
Over there Tybalt is lying dead.
He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed him.
Tybalt was my nephew!
He was my brother’s son!
Oh Prince, oh nephew, oh husband!
Oh, my nephew is dead!
Oh Prince, as you are a man of honor, take revenge for this murder by killing someone from the Montague family.
Oh cousin, cousin!
Benvolio, who started this fight?
Tybalt started the fight before he was killed by Romeo.
Romeo spoke to Tybalt politely and told him how silly this argument was.
He mentioned that you would not approve of the fight.
He said all of this gently and calmly, kneeling down out of respect.
But he could not make peace with Tybalt, who was in an angry mood and wouldn’t listen to talk about peace.
Tybalt and Mercutio began to fight each other fiercely, lunging at one another and dodging each other’s blows.
Romeo cried out, “Stop, my friends.
Break it up.” Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down.
But Tybalt reached under Romeo’s arm and thrust his sword into brave Mercutio.
Then Tybalt fled the scene.
But pretty soon he came back to meet Romeo, who was overcome with the desire for revenge.
As quick as lightning, they started fighting.
Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was killed.
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead.
I’m telling you the truth, I swear on my life.
Benvolio is part of the Montague family.
His loyalties to the Montagues make him tell lies.
He’s not telling the truth.
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together those twenty could only kill one man.
I demand justice.
You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice.
Romeo killed Tybalt.
Romeo must die.
Romeo killed Tybalt.
Tybalt killed Mercutio.
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio’s life?
Not Romeo, Prince.
He was Mercutio’s friend.
His crime did justice’s job by taking Tybalt’s life.
And for that crime, Romeo is hereby exiled from Verona.
I’m involved in your rivalry.
Mercutio was my relative, and he lies dead because of your bloody feud.
I’ll punish you so harshly that you’ll regret causing me this loss.
I won’t listen to your pleas or excuses.
You can’t get out of trouble by praying or crying, so don’t bother.
Tell Romeo to leave the city immediately, or else, if he is found, he will be killed.
Take away this body, and do what I say.
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders.
I wish the sun would hurry up and set and night would come immediately.
When the night comes and everyone goes to sleep, Romeo will leap into my arms, and no one will know.
Beauty makes it possible for lovers to see how to make love in the dark.
Or else love is blind, and its best time is the night.
I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity.
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed.
In the darkness, let me, a shy virgin, learn the strange act of sex so that it seems innocent, modest, and true.
Come, night.
Come, Romeo.
You’re like a day that comes during the night.
You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven.
Come, gentle night.
Come, loving, dark night.
Give me my Romeo.
And when I die, turn him into stars and form a constellation in his image.
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun.
Oh, I have bought love’s mansion, but I haven’t moved in yet.I belong to Romeo now, but he hasn’t taken possession of me yet.
This day is so boring that I feel like a child on the night before a holiday, waiting to put on my fancy new clothes.
Oh, here comes my Nurse, and she brings news.
Every voice that mentions Romeo’s name sounds beautiful.
Now, Nurse, what’s the news?
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up?
Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder.
Oh my, what’s the news?
Why do you look so upset?
Oh, it’s a sad day!
He’s dead.
He’s dead.
He’s dead!
We’re ruined, lady, we’re ruined!
What an awful day!
He’s gone.
He’s been killed.
He’s dead!
Can God be so jealous and hateful?
Romeo is hateful, even though God isn’t.
Oh, Romeo, Romeo, who ever would have thought it would be Romeo?
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this?
This is as bad as the tortures of hell.
Has Romeo killed himself?
Just say “Yes” and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye.
I will no longer be myself if you tell me Romeo killed himself.
If he’s been killed, say “Yes.” If not, say “No.” These short words will determine my joy or my pain.
I saw the wound.
I saw it with my own eyes.
God bless that wound, here on his manly chest.
A pitiful corpse, a bloody, pitiful corpse.
Pale as ashes and drenched in blood.
All the dried blood was so gory.
I fainted when I saw it.
Oh, my heart is breaking.
Oh, my bankrupt heart is breaking.
I’ll send my eyes to prison, and they’ll never be free to look at anything again.
I’ll give my vile body back to the earth.
I’ll never move again.
My body and Romeo’s will lie together in one sad coffin.
Oh, Tybalt, Tybalt, he was the best friend I had.
Oh, polite Tybalt, he was an honorable gentleman.
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die.
What disaster is this?
Has Romeo been killed, and is Tybalt dead too?
Tybalt was my dearest cousin.
Romeo was even dearer to me as my husband.
Let the trumpets play the song of doom, because who can be alive if those two are gone?
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.
Romeo killed Tybalt, and his punishment was banishment.
Oh God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
It did, it did.
Curse the day this happened, but it did.
Oh, he’s like a snake disguised as a flower.
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave?
He’s a beautiful tyrant and a fiendish angel!
He’s a raven with the feathers of the dove.
He’s a lamb who hunts like a wolf!
I hate him, yet he seemed the most wonderful man.
He’s turned out to be the exact opposite of what he seemed.
He’s a saint who should be damned.
He’s a villain who seemed honorable.
Oh nature, what were you doing in hell?
Why did you put the soul of a criminal in the perfect body of a man?
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover?
Oh, I can’t believe the deepest evil lurked inside something so beautiful!
There is no trust, no faith, no honesty in men.
All of them lie.
All of them cheat.
They’re all wicked.
Ah, where’s my servant?—Give me some brandy.—These griefs, these pains, these sorrows make me old.
Shame on Romeo!
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that!
He was not born to be shameful.
Shame does not belong with Romeo.
He deserves only honor, complete honor.
Oh, I was such a beast to be angry at him.
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin?
Am I supposed to say bad things about my own husband?
Ah, my poor husband, who will sing your praises when I, your wife of three hours, have been saying awful things about you?
But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin?
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband.
I’m not going to cry any tears.
I would cry with joy that Romeo is alive, but I should cry tears of grief because Tybalt is dead.
My husband, whom Tybalt wanted to kill, is alive.
Tybalt, who wanted to kill my husband, is dead.
All this is comforting news.
Why, then, should I cry?
There is news worse than the news that Tybalt is dead, news that makes me want to die.
I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.”
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts.
Tybalt’s death would be bad enough if that was all.
Maybe pain likes to have company and can’t come without bringing more pain.
It would have been better if, after she said, “Tybalt’s dead,” she told me my mother or my father, or both, were gone.
That would have made me make the normal cries of sadness.
But to say that Tybalt’s dead and then say, “Romeo has been banished.” To say that is like saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, they’re all dead.
Romeo has been banished.” That news brings infinite death.
No words can express the pain.
Where are my father and my mother, Nurse?
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt’s corpse.
Are you going to join them?
I’ll bring you there.
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears?
I’ll cry my tears for Romeo’s banishment when their tears are dry.
Pick up this rope ladder.
This poor rope ladder, it’s useless now, just like me, because Romeo has been exiled.
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed, but I am a virgin, and I will die a virgin and a widow.
Let’s go, rope ladder.
Nurse, I’m going to lie in my wedding bed.
And death, not Romeo, can take my virginity!
Go to your bedroom.
I’ll find Romeo to comfort you.
I know where he is.
Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight.
I’ll go to him.
He’s hiding out in Friar Lawrence’s cell.

Romeo, come out.
Come out, you frightened man.
Trouble likes you, and you’re married to disaster.
Father, what’s the news?
What punishment did the Prince announce?
What suffering lies in store for me that I don’t know about yet?
You know too much about suffering.
I have news for you about the Prince’s punishment.
Is the Prince’s punishment any less awful than doomsday?
He made a gentler decision.
You won’t die, but you’ll be banished from the city.
Ha, banishment?
Be merciful and say “death.” Exile is much worse than death.
Don’t say “banishment.” From now on, you are banished from Verona.
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide.
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona, except purgatory, torture, and hell itself.
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world, and being banished from the world is death.
Banishment is death by the wrong name.
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I’m being murdered.
Oh, deadly sin!
Oh, rude and unthankful boy!
You committed a crime that is punishable by death, but our kind Prince took sympathy on you and ignored the law when he substituted banishment for death.
This is kind mercy, and you don’t realize it.
It’s torture, not mercy.
Heaven is here because Juliet lives here.
Every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy animal that lives here can see her, but Romeo can’t.
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo.
They can take hold of Juliet’s wonderful white hand and they can kiss her sweet lips.
Even while she remains a pure virgin, she blushes when her lips touch each other because she thinks it’s a sin.
But Romeo can’t kiss her or hold her hand because he’s been banished.
Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city.
Flies are like free men, but I have been banished.
And yet you say that exile is not death?
Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment?
Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell.
They howl about banishment.
If you’re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you’re my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?
You foolish madman, listen to me for a moment.
Your servants were fighting your enemy’s servants before I got here.
I drew my sword to part them.
Right then, that hothead Tybalt showed up with his sword ready.
He taunted me and waved his sword around, making the air hiss.
As we were trading blows, more and more people showed up to join the fight, until the Prince came and broke everyone up.
Oh, where’s Romeo?
Have you seen him today?
I’m glad he wasn’t here for this fight.
Madam, I had a lot on my mind an hour before dawn this morning, so I went for a walk.
Underneath the Sycamore grove that grows on the west side of the city, I saw your son taking an early-morning walk.
I headed toward him, but he saw me coming and hid in the woods.
I thought he must be feeling the same way I was—wanting to be alone and tired of his own company.
I figured he was avoiding me, and I was perfectly happy to leave him alone and keep to myself.
He’s been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs.
But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes home to escape the light.
Oh, you’re just going to talk about banishment again.
I’ll give you protection from that word.
I’ll give you the antidote for trouble: philosophy.
Philosophy will comfort you even though you’ve been banished.
You’re still talking about “banished?” Forget about philosophy!
Unless philosophy can create a Juliet, or pick up a town and put it somewhere else, or reverse a prince’s punishment, it doesn’t do me any good.
Don’t say anything else.
Oh, so madmen like you are also deaf.
How should madmen hear, if wise men can’t even see?
Let me talk to you about your situation.
You can’t talk about something that you don’t feel.
If you were as young as I am, if you were in love with Juliet, if you had just married her an hour ago, if then you murdered Tybalt, if you were lovesick like me, and if you were banished, then you might talk about it.
You might also tear your hair out of your head and collapse to the ground the way I do right now.
Get up.
Somebody’s knocking.
Hide yourself, good Romeo.
I won’t hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people’s searching eyes.
Listen, they’re still knocking!— Run and hide in my study.—Just a minute—For the love of God, why are you being so stupid?
I’m coming.
I’m coming.
Why are you knocking so hard?
Where do you come from?
What do you want?
Oh, holy Friar, Oh, tell me, holy Friar, where is my lady’s husband?
Where’s Romeo?
He’s there on the ground.
He’s been getting drunk on his own tears.
Oh, he’s acting just like Juliet, just like her.
Oh painful sympathy!
What a pitiful problem!
She’s lying on the ground just like him, blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up.
Stand up.
Stand up if you’re really a man.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand up.
Why should you fall into so deep a moan?
Nurse!
Ah sir, ah sir.
Well, death is the end for everybody.
Were you talking about Juliet?
How is she?
Does she think that I’m a practiced murderer because I tainted our newfound joy by killing one of her close relatives?
Where is she?
How is she doing?
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love?
Oh, she doesn’t say anything, sir.
She just weeps and weeps.
She falls on her bed and then starts to get up.
Then she calls out Tybalt’s name and cries “Romeo,” and then she falls down again.
She’s calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her, just like I murdered her relative.
Tell me, Friar, in what part of my body is my name embedded?
Tell me, so I can cut it out of myself. 
Hold on, and don’t act out of desperation.
Are you a man?
You look like a man, but your tears make you look like a woman.
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast.
You’re a shameful woman who looks like a man or else an ugly creature who’s half-man, half-beast.
You have amazed me.
I swear by my holy order, I thought you were smarter and more rational than this.
Have you killed Tybalt?
Will you kill yourself?
And would you also kill your wife, who shares your life, by committing the sin of killing yourself?
Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth?
Life is the union of soul in body through the miracle of birth, but you would throw all that away.
You bring shame to your body, your love, and your mind.
You have so much natural talent, but like someone who hoards money, you use none of your talent for the right purpose—not your body, not your love, not your mind.
Your body is just a wax figure, without the honor of a man.
The love that you promised was a hollow lie.
You’re killing the love that you vowed to cherish.
Your mind, which aids both your body and your love, has mishandled both of them.
You’re like a stupid soldier whose gunpowder explodes because he’s careless.
The things you were supposed to use to defend yourself end up killing you.
Get up, man!
Your Juliet is alive.
It was for her that you were almost killed earlier.
Be happy that she’s alive.
Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt.
Be happy that you’re alive.
The law that threatened your life was softened into exile.
Be happy about that.
Your life is full of blessings.
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy.
But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you’re whining about your bad luck and your love.
Listen, listen, people who act like that die miserable.
Go be with your love, as it was decided at your wedding.
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her.
But get out of there before the night watchmen take their positions.
Then you will escape to the city of Mantua, where you’ll live until we can make your marriage public and make peace between your families.
We’ll ask the Prince to pardon you.
Then we’ll welcome you back with twenty thousand times more joy than you’ll have when you leave this town crying.
Go ahead, Nurse.
Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed.
I’m sure they’re all so sad that they’ll be ready to sleep.
Romeo is coming.
O Lord, I could stay here all night listening to such good advice.
Educated men are so impressive!
Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me.
Here, sir, this is a ring she asked me to give you.
Hurry up, it’s getting late.
This makes me feel so much better!
Now get out of here.
Good night.
Everything depends on this: either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions, or leave in disguise after daybreak.
Take a little vacation in Mantua.
I’ll find your servant, and he’ll update you now and then on your case as it stands here.
Give me your hand.
It’s late.
Farewell.
Good night.
I’m off to experience the greatest joy of all, but still it’s sad to leave you in such a rush.
Farewell.
Things have turned out so unluckily, sir, that we haven’t had time to convince our daughter to marry you.
Listen, she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly, and so did I.
Well, we were all born to die.
It’s very late, she won’t be coming downstairs tonight.
Believe me, if you weren’t here visiting me, I myself would have gone to bed an hour ago.
These times of pain are bad times for romance.
Madam, good night.
Give my regards to your daughter.
I will.
And I’ll find out what she thinks about marriage early tomorrow.
Tonight she is shut up in her room, alone with her sadness.
Sir Paris, I’ll make a desperate argument for my child’s love.
I think she’ll do whatever I say.
No, I think she’ll do all that and more.
I have no doubt about it.
Wife, visit her in her room before you go to bed.
Tell her about my son Paris’s love for her.
And tell her, listen to me, on Wednesday—Wait—What day is today?
Monday, my lord.
Monday!
Ha, ha!
Well, Wednesday is too soon.
Let it be on Thursday.
On Thursday, tell her, she’ll be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready?
Do you think it’s a good idea to rush?
We shouldn’t have too big a celebration—we can invite a friend or two.
Listen, because Tybalt was just killed, people might think that we don’t care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party.
Therefore we’ll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding, and that’s it.
What do you think about Thursday?
My lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow.
Well go on home.
Thursday it is, then. 
Are you going?
It’s still a long time until daybreak.
Don’t be afraid.
That sound you heard was the  It was the lark, the bird that sings at dawn, not the nightingale.
Look, my love, what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?
Night is over, and day is coming.
If I want to live, I must go.
If I stay, I’ll die.
That light is not daylight, I know it.
It’s some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua.
So stay for a while.
You don’t have to go yet.
Let me be captured.
Let me be put to death.
I am content, if that’s the way you want it.
I’ll say the light over there isn’t morning.
I’ll say it’s the reflection of the moon.
I’ll say that sound isn’t the lark ringing in the sky.
I want to stay more than I want to go.
Come, death, and welcome!
Juliet wants it this way.
How are you, my love?
Let’s talk.
It’s not daylight.
It is, it is.
Get out of here, be gone, go away!
It’s the lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise.
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night.
It’s not true because she separates us.
More and more light.
More and more pain for us.
Madam.
Nurse?
Your mother is coming to your bedroom.
Day has broken.
Be careful.
Watch out.
Then the window lets day in, and life goes out the window.
Farewell, farewell!
Give me one kiss, and I’ll go down.
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight, and makes himself an artificial night.
This mood of his is going to bring bad news, unless someone smart can fix what’s bothering him.
My noble uncle, do you know why he acts this way?
I don’t know, and he won’t tell me.
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason?
I’ve tried, and many of our friends have tried to make him talk, but he keeps his thoughts to himself.
He doesn’t want any friend but himself, and though I don’t know whether he’s a  Look—here he comes.
If you don’t mind, please step aside.
He’ll either have to tell me what’s wrong or else tell me no over and over.
I hope you’re lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around. 
Are you gone like that, my love, my lord?
Yes, my husband, my friend!
I must hear from you every day in the hour.
In a minute there are many days.
Oh, by this count I’ll be many years older before I see my Romeo again.
Farewell!
I won’t miss any chance to send my love to you.
Oh, do you think we’ll ever meet again?
I have no doubts.
All these troubles will give us stories to tell each other later in life.
Oh God, I have a soul that predicts evil things!
Now that you are down there, you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb.
Either my eyesight is failing me, or you look pale.
And trust me, love, you look pale to me too.
Sadness takes away our color.
Goodbye, Goodbye!
Oh luck, luck.
Everyone says you can’t make up your mind.
If you change your mind so much, what are you going to do to Romeo, who’s so faithful?
Change your mind, luck.
I hope maybe then you’ll send him back home soon.  
Who’s that calling?
Is it my mother?
Isn’t she up very late?
Or is she up very early?
What strange reason could she have for coming here?
What’s going on, Juliet?
Madam, I am not well.
Will you cry about your cousin’s death forever?
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears?
If you could, you couldn’t bring him back to life.
So stop crying.
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love.
But too much grief makes you look stupid.
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss.
You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for will feel nothing.
Feeling the loss like this, I can’t help but weep for him forever.
Well, girl, you’re weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive.
What villain, madam?
That villain, Romeo.
That’s because the murderer is alive.
Yes, madam, he lies beyond my reach.
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin’s death except me!
We’ll have revenge for it.
Don’t worry about that.
Stop crying.
I’ll send a man to Mantua, where that exiled rogue is living.
Our man will poison Romeo’s drink, and Romeo will join Tybalt in death.
And then, I hope, you’ll be satisfied.
I’ll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .


dead—dead is how my poor heart feels when I think about my poor cousin.
Madam, if you can find a man to deliver the poison, I’ll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it.
Oh, how I hate to hear people say his name and not be able to go after him.
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him.
Find out the way, and I’ll find the right man.
But now I have joyful news for you, girl.
And it’s good to have joy in such a joyless time.
What’s the news?
Please tell me.
Well, well, you have a careful father, child.
He has arranged a sudden day of joy to end your sadness.
A day that you did not expect and that I did not seek out.
Madam, tell me quickly, what day is that?
Indeed, my child, at Saint Peter’s Church early Thursday morning, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride.
Now, I swear by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too, he will not make me a joyful bride there.
This is a strange rush.
How can I marry him, this husband, before he comes to court me?
Please, tell my father, madam, I won’t marry yet.
And, when I do marry, I swear, it will be Romeo, whom you know I hate, rather than Paris.
That’s really news!
Here comes your father.
Tell him so yourself, and see how he takes the news.
When the sun sets, the air drizzles dew.
But at the death of my brother’s son, it rains a downpour.
What are you, girl?
Some kind of fountain?
Why are you still crying?
Will you cry forever?
In one little body you seem like a ship, the sea, and the winds.
Your eyes, which I call the sea, flow with tears.
The ship is your body which is sailing on the salt flood of your tears.
The winds are your sighs.
Your sighs and your tears are raging.
Unless you calm down, tears and sighs will overwhelm your body and sink your ship.
So where do things stand, wife?
Have you told her our decision?
Yes, sir, I told her.
But she won’t agree.
She says thank you but refuses.
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave!
Wait!
Hold on, wife.
I don’t understand.
How can this be?
She refuses?
Isn’t she grateful?
Isn’t she proud of such a match?
Doesn’t she realize what a blessing this is?
Doesn’t she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom?
I am not proud of what you have found for me.
But I am thankful that you have found it.
I can never be proud of what I hate.
But I can be thankful for something I hate, if it was meant with love.
What is this?
What is this fuzzy logic?
What is this?
I hear you say “proud” and “I thank you,” and then “no thank you” and “not proud,” you spoiled little girl.
You’re not really giving me any thanks or showing me any pride.
But get yourself ready for Thursday.
You’re going to Saint Peter’s Church to marry Paris.
And if you don’t go on your own, I’ll drag you there.
You disgust me, you little bug!
You worthless girl!
You pale face!
Shame on you!
What, are you crazy?
Good father, I’m begging you on my knees, be patient and listen to me say just one thing.
Forget about you, you worthless girl!
You disobedient wretch!
I’ll tell you what.
Go to church on Thursday or never look me in the face again.
Don’t say anything.
Don’t reply.
Don’t talk back to me.
I feel like slapping you.
Wife, we never thought ourselves blessed that God only gave us this one child.
But now I see that this one is one too many.
We were cursed when we had her.
She disgusts me, the little hussy!
God in heaven bless her!
My lord, you’re wrong to berate her like that.
And why, wise lady?
You shut up, old woman.
Go blabber with your gossiping friends.
I’ve said nothing wrong.
Oh, for God’s sake.
Can’t I say something?
Be quiet, you mumbling fool!
Say your serious things at lunch with your gossiping friends.
We don’t need to hear it.
You’re getting too angry.
Goddammit!
It makes me mad.
Day and night, hour after hour, all the time, at work, at play, alone, in company, my top priority has always been to find her a husband.
Now I’ve provided a husband from a noble family, who is good-looking, young, well-educated.
He’s full of good qualities.
He’s the man of any girl’s dreams.
But this wretched, whimpering fool, like a whining puppet, she looks at this good fortune and answers, “I won’t get married.
I can’t fall in love.
I’m too young.
Please, excuse me.” Well, if you won’t get married, I’ll excuse you.
Eat wherever you want, but you can no longer live under my roof.
Consider that.
Think about it.
I’m not in the habit of joking.
Thursday is coming.
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice.
If you act like my daughter, I’ll marry you to my friend.
If you don’t act like my daughter, you can beg, starve, and die in the streets.
I swear on my soul, I will never take you back or do anything for you.
Believe me.
Think about it.
I won’t break this promise.
Is there no pity in the sky that can see my sadness?
Oh, my sweet mother, don’t throw me out!
Delay this marriage for a month, or a week.
Or, if you don’t delay, make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies.
Don’t talk to me, because I won’t say a word.
Do as you please, because I’m done worrying about you.
Oh God!—Oh Nurse, how can this be stopped?
My husband is alive on earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven.
How can I bring those promises back down to earth, unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven?
Give me comfort.
Give me advice.
Oh no!
Oh no!
Why does heaven play tricks on someone as weak as me?
What do you say?
Don’t you have one word of joy?
Give me some comfort, Nurse.
This is what I have to say: Romeo has been banished.
And it’s a sure thing that he will never come back to challenge you.
If he does come back, he’ll have to sneak back undercover.
Then, since things are the way they are, I think the best thing to do is to marry the count.
Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman!
Romeo’s a dishcloth compared to him.
Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris.
Curse my very heart, but I think you should be happy in this second marriage, because it’s better than your first.
Even if it’s not better, your first marriage is over.
Or if Romeo is as good as Paris, Romeo doesn’t live here, so you don’t get to enjoy him.
Are you speaking from your heart?
I speak from my heart and from my soul too.
If not, curse them both.
Amen!
What?
Well, you have given me great comfort.
Go inside and tell my mother that I’m gone.
I made my father angry, so I went to Friar Lawrence’s cell to confess and be forgiven.
Alright, I will.
This is a good idea.
That damned old lady!
Oh, that most wicked fiend!
Is it a worse sin for her to want me to break my vows or for her to say bad things about my husband after she praised him so many times before?
Away with you and your advice, Nurse.
From now on, I will never tell you what I feel in my heart.
I’m going to the Friar to find out his solution.
If everything else fails, at least I have the power to take my own life.
On Thursday, sir?
That’s very soon.
That’s how my future father-in-law Capulet wants it, and I’m not dragging my feet.
You say you don’t know what the girl thinks.
That’s a rocky road to be riding.
I don’t like it.
She’s grieving too much over the death of Tybalt.
So I haven’t had the chance to talk to her about love.
Romantic love doesn’t happen when people are in mourning.
Now, sir, her father thinks it’s dangerous that she allows herself to become so sad.
He’s being smart by rushing our marriage to stop her from crying.
She cries too much by herself.
If she had someone to be with her, she would stop crying.
Now you know the reason for the rush.
Look, sir, here comes the lady walking toward my cell.
I’m happy to meet you, my lady and my wife.
That might be the case sir, 
Good morning, cousin.
Is it that early in the day?
It’s only just now nine o'clock.
Oh my, time goes by slowly when you’re sad.
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry?
It was.
What’s making you so sad and your hours so long?
I don’t have the thing that makes time fly.
You’re in love?
Out.
Out of love?
I love someone.
She doesn’t love me.
It’s sad.
Love looks like a nice thing, but it’s actually very rough when you experience it.
What’s sad is that love is supposed to be blind, but it can still make you do whatever it wants.
So, where should we eat? 
That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday.
What must be will be.
That is a certain truth.
Have you come to make confession to this father?
If I answered that question, I’d be making confession to you.
Don’t deny to him that you love me.
I’ll confess to you that I love him.
You will also confess, I’m sure, that you love me.
If I do so, it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face.
You poor soul, your face has suffered many tears.
The tears haven’t done much because my face looked bad enough before I started to cry.
You’re treating your face even worse by saying that.
What I say isn’t slander, sir.
It’s the truth.
And what I said, I said to my face.
Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.
That may be the case, because my face doesn’t belong to me.—Do you have time for me now, Father, or should I come to you at evening mass?
I have time for you now, my sad daughter.
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion!
Juliet, I will wake you early on Thursday Oh, shut the door, and after you shut it, come over here and weep with me.
This mess is beyond hope, beyond cure, beyond help!
Oh, Juliet, I already know about your sad situation.
It’s a problem too hard for me to solve.
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday, and that nothing can delay it.
Don’t tell me that you’ve heard about this marriage, Friar, unless you can tell me how to prevent it.
If you who are so wise can’t help, please be kind enough to call my solution wise. 
Hold on, daughter, I see some hope.
But we must act boldly because the situation is so desperate.
If you’ve made up your mind to kill yourself instead of marrying Count Paris, then you’ll probably be willing to try something like death to solve this shameful problem.
You can wrestle with death to escape from shame.
And if you dare to do it, I’ll give you the solution.
Oh, you can tell me to jump off the battle posts of any tower, or to walk down the crime-ridden streets of a slum.
Or tell me to sit in a field full of poisonous snakes.
Chain me up with wild bears.
Hide me every night in a morgue full of dead bodies with wet, smelly flesh and skulls without jawbones.
Or tell me to climb down into a freshly dug grave, and hide me with a dead man in his tomb.
All those ideas make me tremble when I hear them named.
But I will do them without fear or dread in order to be a pure wife to my sweet love.
Hold on, then.
Go home, be cheerful, and tell them you agree to marry Paris.
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone.
Don’t let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom. 
Give me the vial.
Give it to me!
Don’t talk to me about fear.
Love will give me strength, and strength will help me accomplish this plan.
Goodbye, dear Father.
You won’t get any bad cooks from me.
I’ll test them by making them lick their fingers.
How can you test them like that?
Easy, sir.
It’s a bad cook who can’t lick his own fingers.
So the cooks who can’t lick their fingers aren’t hired.
Go, get out of here.
We’re unprepared for this wedding celebration.
Yes, that’s true.
Well, there’s a chance he may do her some good.
She’s a stubborn little brat.
Look, she’s come home from confession with a happy look on her face.
So, my headstrong daughter, where have you been?
I went somewhere where I learned that being disobedient to my father is a sin.
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness.
Send for the Count.
Go tell him about this.
I’ll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning.
I met the young man at Lawrence’s cell.
I treated him with the proper love, as well as I could, while still being modest.
Well, I’m glad about this.
This is good.
Stand up.
This is the way it should be.
I want to see the count.
Yes, alright, go, I say, and bring him here.
Now, before God, our whole city owes this friar a great debt.
Nurse, will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I’ll need to wear tomorrow?
No, not until Thursday.
There’s plenty of time.
Go, Nurse, go with her.
We’ll have the wedding at the church tomorrow.
Our supplies will be short for the party.
It’s already almost night.
Don’t worry, I will set things in motion.
And everything will be alright, I promise you, wife.
You should go to Juliet and dress her up.
I’m not going to bed tonight.
Leave me alone.
I’ll pretend to be the housewife for once.
Hey!
What?
They’re all gone?
Well, I will walk by myself to Count Paris to get him ready for tomorrow.
My heart is wonderfully happy because this troubled girl has been taken back and now will be married.
Yes, those are the best clothes.
But, gentle Nurse, please leave me alone tonight.
I have to say a lot of prayers to make the heavens bless me.
You know that my life is troubled and full of sin.
What, are you busy?
Do you need my help?
No, madam, we’ve figured out the best things for me to wear tomorrow at the ceremony.
So if it’s okay with you, I’d like to be left alone now.
Let the Nurse sit up with you tonight.
I’m sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities.
Good night.
Go to bed and get some rest.
I’m sure you need it.
Good-bye.
Only God knows when we’ll meet again.
There is a slight cold fear cutting through my veins.
It almost freezes the heat of life.
I’ll call them back here to comfort me.
Nurse!—Oh, what good would she do here?
In my desperate situation, I have to act alone.
Alright, here’s the vial.
What if this mixture doesn’t work at all?
Will I be married tomorrow morning?
No, no, this knife will stop it.
Lie down right there.  
If I wake up too early, won’t I go insane with all these horrible, frightening things around me, start playing with my ancestors' bones, and pull Tybalt’s corpse out of his death shroud?
Will I grab one of my dead ancestor’s bones and bash in my own skull?
Oh, look!
I think I see my cousin Tybalt’s ghost.
He’s looking for Romeo because Romeo killed him with his sword.
Wait, Tybalt, wait!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo!
Here’s a drink.
I drink to you.
No, cousin, I’m crying.
Good man, why are you crying?
I’m crying because of how sad you are.
Yes, this is what love does.
My sadness sits heavy in my chest, and you want to add your own sadness to mine so there’s even more.
I have too much sadness already, and now you’re going to make me sadder by feeling sorry for you.
Here’s what love is: a smoke made out of lovers' sighs.
When the smoke clears, love is a fire burning in your lover’s eyes.
If you frustrate love, you get an ocean made out of lovers' tears.
What else is love?
It’s a wise form of madness.
It’s a sweet lozenge that you choke on.
Goodbye, cousin.
Wait.
I’ll come with you.
If you leave me like this, you’re doing me wrong.
I’m not myself.
I’m not here.
This isn’t Romeo—he’s somewhere else.
Tell me seriously, who is the one you love?
Seriously?
You mean I should groan and tell you?
Groan?
No.
But tell me seriously who it is.
Wait.
Take these keys and get more spices, Nurse.
They’re calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen.
Come on, wake up, wake up, wake up!
The second cock crowed.
The curfew-bell rang.
It’s three o'clock.
Go get the baked meats, good Angelica.
Don’t worry about the cost.
Go, you old housewife, go.
Go to bed, dear.
You’ll be sick tomorrow because you’ve stayed up all night.
No, not at all.
What?
I’ve stayed up all night many times before for less important matters, and I’ve never gotten sick.
Yes, you’ve been a ladies' man in your time.
But I’ll make sure you don’t stay up any later now.
A jealous woman, a jealous woman!
Now, fellow, what have you got there?
Things for the cook, sir.
But I don’t know what they are.
Hurry up, hurry up.
I’m smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter.
Right, and well said.
That guy’s funny.
He’s got a head full of logs.
Goodness, it’s daylight.
The count will be here soon with music.
At least he said he would.
I hear him coming near.
Nurse!
Wife!
What?
Hey, Nurse!
Go wake Juliet.
Go and get her dressed.
I’ll go and chat with Paris.
Hey, hurry up, hurry up!
The bridegroom is already here.
Hurry up, I say.
Mistress!
Hey, mistress!
Juliet!
I bet she’s fast asleep.
Hey, lamb!
Hey, lady!
Hey, you lazy bones!
Hey, love, I say!
Madam!
Sweetheart!
Hey, bride!
What, you don’t say a word?
You take your beauty sleep now.
Get yourself a week’s worth of sleep.
Tomorrow night, I bet, Count Paris won’t let you get much rest.
God forgive me.
Alright, and amen.
How sound asleep she is!
I must wake her up.
Madam, madam, madam!
Yes, let the count take you in your bed.
He’ll wake you up, I bet.
Won’t he?
What’s all the noise in here?
Oh, sad day!
What is the matter?
Look, look!
Oh, what a sad day!
Oh my, Oh my!
My child, my reason for living, wake up, look up, or I’ll die with you!
Help, help!
Call for help.
For shame, bring Juliet out here.
Her bridegroom is here.
She’s dead, deceased, she’s dead.
Curse the day!
Curse the day!
She’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!
No!
Let me see her.
Oh no!
She’s cold.
Her blood has stopped, and her joints are stiff.
She’s been dead for some time.
She’s dead, like a beautiful flower, killed by an unseasonable frost.
Oh, sad day!
Oh, this is a painful time!
Death, which has taken her away to make me cry, now ties up my tongue and won’t let me speak.
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
She’s ready to go, but she’ll never return. 
Death is my son-in-law.
Death is my heir.
My daughter married death.
I will die and leave Death everything.
Life, wealth, everything belongs to Death.
Have I waited so long to see this morning, only to see this?
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
This is the most miserable hour of all time!
I had only one child, one poor child, one poor and loving child, the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself, and cruel Death has stolen it from me!
Oh pain!
Oh painful, painful, painful day!
The saddest day, most painful day that I ever, ever did behold!
Oh day!
Oh day!
Oh day!
Oh hateful day!
There has never been so black a day as today.
Oh painful day, Oh painful day!
She was tricked, divorced, wronged, spited, killed!
Death, the most despicable thing, tricked her.
Cruel, cruel Death killed her.
Oh love!
Oh life!
There is no life, but my love is dead!
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!
Why did this have to happen now?
Why did Death have to ruin our wedding?
Oh child!
Oh child!
My soul and not my child!
You are dead!
Oh no!
My child is dead.
My child will be buried, and so will my joys.
Be quiet, for shame!
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming.
You had this child with the help of heaven.
Now heaven has her.
She is in a better place.
You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life.
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder—that was your idea of heaven.
And now you cry, even though she has risen up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
Oh, in this love, you love your child so badly, that you go mad, even though she is in heaven.
It is best to marry well and die young, better than to be married for a long time.
Dry up your tears, and put your rosemary on this beautiful corpse.
And, in accordance with custom, carry her to the church in her best clothes.
It’s natural for us to shed tears for her, but the truth is, we should be happy for her.
All the things that we prepared for the wedding party will now be used for the funeral.
Our happy music will now be sad.
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast.
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches.
Our bridal flowers will cover a buried corpse.
And everything will be used for the opposite purpose from what we intended.
Sir, you go in.
And, madam, go with him.
And you go too, Sir Paris.
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave.
The heavens hang threateningly over you for some past sin.
Don’t disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven’s will.
Well, we can put away our pipes and go home.
Honest good boys, ah, put 'em away, put 'em away.
As you know, this is a sad case.
Yes, well, things could get better.
Musicians, oh, musicians, play “Heart’s Ease,” “Heart’s Ease.” Oh, I’ll die if you don’t play “Heart’s Ease.” Why “Heart’s Ease”?
Oh, musicians, because my heart is singing “My Heart is Full of Woe.” Oh, play me some happy sad song to comfort me.
No, not a sad song.
It’s not the right time to play.
You won’t, then?
No.
Then I’ll really give it to you.
What will you give us?
No money, I swear.
But I’ll play a trick on you.
I’ll call you a minstrel.
Then I’ll call you a serving-creature.
Then I’ll smack you on the head with the serving-creature’s knife.
I won’t mess around.
I’ll make you sing.
Do you hear me?
If you make us sing, you’ll hear us.
Please, put down your knife and stop kidding around.
So you don’t like my kidding around!
I’ll kid you to death, and then I’ll put down my knife.
Answer me like men.
Well, sir, because silver has a sweet sound.
That’s a stupid answer!
What do you say, Hugh  I say “silver sound,” because musicians play to earn silver.
Another studpid answer!
What do you say, James  Well, I don’t know what to say.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
You’re the singer.
I’ll answer for you.
It is “music with her silver sound,” because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds.
What an annoying man, this guy is!
Forget about him, Jack!
Come, we’ll go in there.
We’ll wait for the mourners and stay for dinner.
If I can trust my dreams, then some joyful news is coming soon.
Love rules my heart, and all day long a strange feeling has been making me cheerful.
I had a dream that my lady came and found me dead.
It’s a strange dream that lets a dead man think!
She came and brought me back to life by kissing my lips.
I rose from the dead and was an emperor.
Oh my!
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love, when merely thinking about love makes me so happy.
Do you have news from Verona!—What is it, Balthasar?
Do you bring me a letter from the friar?
How is my wife?
Is my father well?
How is my Juliet?
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well.
Then she is well, and nothing is wrong.
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb, and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven.
I saw her buried in her family’s tomb, and then I came here to tell you the news.
Oh, pardon me for bringing this bad news, but you told me it was my job, sir.
You wouldn’t tell a sick man he “seriously” has to make his will—it would just make him worse.
Seriously, cousin, I love a woman.
I guessed that already when I guessed you were in love.
Then you were right on target.
The woman I love is beautiful.
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest.
Well, you’re not on target there.
She refuses to be hit by  So she’s made a vow to be a virgin forever?
Yes she has, and by keeping celibate, she wastes her beauty.
If you starve yourself of sex you can’t ever have children, and so your beauty is lost to future generations.
She’s too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven’s blessing by making me despair.
She’s sworn off love, and that promise has left me alive but dead, living only to talk about it now.
Take my advice.
Don’t think about her.
Teach me to forget to think!
Is it really true?
Then I rebel against you, stars!
You know where I live.
Get me some ink and paper, and hire some horses to ride.
I will leave here for Verona tonight.
Please, sir, have patience.
You look pale and wild as if you’re going to hurt yourself.
Tsk, you’re wrong.
Leave me and do what I told you to do.
Don’t you have a letter for me from the friar?
No, my good lord.
No matter.
Get on your way and hire those horses.
I’ll be with you right away.
Well, Juliet, I’ll lie with you tonight.
Let’s see how.
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men!
I remember a pharmacist who lives nearby.
I remember he wears shabby clothes and has bushy eyebrows.
He makes drugs from herbs.
He looks poor and miserable and worn out to the bone.
He had a tortoise shell hanging up in his shop as well as a stuffed alligator and other skins of strange fish.
There were a few empty boxes on his shelves, as well as green clay pots, and some musty seeds.
There were a few strands of string and mashed rose petals on display.
Noticing all this poverty, I said to myself, “If a man needed some poison”—which they would immediately kill you for selling in Mantua—“here is a miserable wretch who’d sell it to him.” Oh, this idea came before I needed the poison.
But this same poor man must sell it to me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Today’s a holiday, so the beggar’s shop is shut.
Hey!
Pharmacist!
Who’s that calling so loud?
Come here, man.
I see that you are poor.
Here are forty ducats.
Let me have a shot of poison, something that works so fast that the person who takes it will die as fast as gunpowder exploding in a canon.
I have lethal poisons like that.
But it’s against the law to sell them in Mantua, and the penalty is death.
You’re this poor and wretched and still afraid to die?
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger.
I can see in your eyes that you’re starving.
Anyone can see that you’re a beggar.
The world is not your friend, and neither is the law.
The world doesn’t make laws to make you rich.
So don’t be poor.
Break the law, and take this money. 
I agree because I’m poor, not because I want to.
I pay you because you’re poor, not because you want me to buy this.    
Holy Franciscan Friar!
Brother, hey!
That sounds like the voice of Friar John.
Welcome back from Mantua.
What does Romeo say?
Or, if he wrote down his thoughts, give me his letter.
I went to find another poor friar from our order to accompany me.
He was here in this city visiting the sick.
When I found him, the town health officials suspected that we were both in a house that had been hit with the plague.
They quarantined the house, sealed up the doors, and refused to let us out.
I couldn’t go to Mantua because I was stuck there.
Then who took my letter to Romeo?
I couldn’t send it.
Here it is.
Unhappy fortune!
By my brotherhood, the letter was not just a nice greeting.
It was full of very important information.
It’s very dangerous that it hasn’t been sent.
Friar John, go and get me an iron crowbar.
Bring it straight back to my cell.
Brother, I’ll go and bring it to you.
Now I must go to the tomb alone.
Within three hours Juliet will wake up.
She’ll be very angry with me that Romeo doesn’t know what happened.
But I’ll write again to Mantua, and I’ll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes.
That poor living corpse.
She’s shut inside a dead man’s tomb!
Give me your torch, boy.
Go away and stay apart from me.
Put the torch out, so I can’t be seen.
Hide under the yew-trees over there.
Listen to make sure no one is coming through the graveyard.
If you hear any one, whistle to me to signal that someone is approaching.
Give me those flowers.
Do as I tell you.
Go.
The boy is warning me that someone approaches.
Who could be walking around here tonight?
Who’s ruining my rituals of true love?
It’s someone with a torch!
I must hide in the darkness for awhile.
Give me that pickax and the crowbar.
I’ll go, sir, and I won’t bother you.
That’s the way to show me friendship.
Take this. 
I must indeed.
That’s why I came here.
Good and noble young man, don’t mess with someone who’s desperate.
Get away from here and leave me.
Think about the ones who have died.
Let them put fear in your heart.
Please, young man, don’t make me angry.
I don’t want to commit another crime.
Oh, go away!
I swear, I love you more than I love myself.
For I’ve come here with weapons to use against myself.
Don’t stay here, go away.
Live, and from now on, say a madman mercifully told you to run away.
I refuse your request.
I’m arresting you as a criminal.
Are you going to provoke me?
Alright, let’s fight, boy!
Oh Lord, they’re fighting!
I’ll go call the watch.
If you are merciful, open the tomb and lay me next to Juliet.
Alright, I will.
Let me look at this face.
It’s Mercutio’s relative, noble Count Paris!
What did my man say?
I was worried, so I wasn’t listening to him while we were riding.
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet.
Isn’t that what he said?
Or was I dreaming?
Or am I crazy?
Did I hear him say something about Juliet and jump to conclusions?
Oh, give me your hand.
Both of us had such bad luck!
I’ll bury you in a magnificent grave.
A grave?
Oh no!
This is a lantern, dead Paris.
Juliet lies here, and her beauty fills this tomb with light.
Dead men, lie there.
You are being buried by another dead man. 
How often are men happy right before they die!
They call it the lightness before death.
Oh, how can I call this lightness?
Oh, my love!
My wife!
Death has sucked the honey from your breath, but it has not yet ruined your beauty.
You haven’t been conquered.
There is still red in your lips and in your cheeks.
Death has not yet turned them pale.
Tybalt, are you lying there in your bloody death shroud?
Oh, what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young.
Forgive me, cousin!
Ah, dear Juliet, why are you still so beautiful?
Should I believe that death is in love with you, and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress?
I don’t like that idea, so I’ll stay with you.
And I will never leave this tomb.
Here, here I’ll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids.
Oh, I’ll rest here forever.
I’ll forget about all the bad luck that has troubled me.
Eyes, look out for the last time!
Arms, make your last embrace!
And lips, you are the doors of breath.
Seal with a righteous kiss the deal I have made with death forever.
ROMEO  Oh, that pharmacist was honest!
His drugs work quickly.
So I die with a kiss.
Do it by letting your eyes wander freely.
Look at other beautiful girls.
That will only make me think more about how beautiful  I’ll show you how to forget, or else I’ll die owing you that lesson.
Saint Francis, help me!
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones!
Who’s there?
I’m a friend, a friend who knows you well.
God bless you!
Tell me, my good friend, what is that light over there?
The one that vainly lights up the darkness for worms and skulls without eyes?
It looks to me like it’s burning in the Capulet tomb.
That is where it’s burning, father.
My master is there.
The one you love.
Who is it?
Romeo.
How long has he been there?
For a full half hour.
Go with me to the tomb.
I don’t dare, sir.
My master doesn’t know I’m still here.
He threatened me with death if I stayed to look at what he was doing.
Stay, then.
I’ll go alone.
I’m suddenly afraid.
Oh, I’m very scared something awful has happened.
As I slept under this yew-tree here, I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him.
Oh no!
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb?
Why are these bloody swords lying here, abandoned by their masters?
Next to this place of peace?
Oh friendly friar!
Where is my husband?
I remember very well where I should be, and here I am.
Where is my Romeo?
I hear some noise.
Lady, come out of the tomb.
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan.
Come, come away.
Your husband lies dead there, and Paris too.
Come, I’ll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns.
Don’t wait to ask questions.
The watch is coming.
Come, let’s go, good Juliet, I don’t dare stay any longer.
Go, get out of here.
I’m not going anywhere.
What’s this here?
It’s a cup, closed in my true love’s hand?
Poison, I see, has been the cause of his death.
How rude!
He drank it all, and didn’t leave any to help me afterward.
I will kiss your lips.
Perhaps there’s still some poison on them, to make me die with a medicinal kiss.
Oh, noise?
Then I’ll be quick.
Oh, good, a knife!
My body will be your sheath.
Rust inside my body and let me die.
This is the place.
There, where the torch is burning.
The ground is bloody.
Search the graveyard.
Go, some of you, arrest whoever you find.
This is a pitiful sight!
The count is dead.
Juliet is bleeding.
Her body is warm, and she seems to have been dead only a short time, even though she has been buried for two days.
Go, tell the Prince.
Run to the Capulets.
Wake up the Montagues.
Have some others search.
We see the cause of all this pain.
But we’ll have to investigate to discover the whole story.
Here’s Romeo’s man.
We found him in the churchyard.
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here.
Here is a friar who’s trembling, sighing and weeping.
We took this pickax and this shovel from him, as he was walking from this side of the graveyard.
Very suspicious.
Hold the friar too.
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time?
What’s the problem, that they cry out so loud?
Some people in the street are crying “Romeo.” Some are crying “Juliet,” and some are crying “Paris.” They’re all running in an open riot toward our tomb.
What’s this awful thing that everyone’s crying about?
Prince, here lies Count Paris killed.
And Romeo dead.
And Juliet.
She was dead before, but now she’s warm and hasn’t been dead for long.
Investigate how this foul murder came about.
Here is a friar, and dead Romeo’s man.
They’ve got tools on them—tools they could use to open these tombs.
Oh heavens!
Oh wife, look at how our daughter bleeds!
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague’s back, but instead it’s mis-sheathed in my daughter’s breast.
Oh my!
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I’m old and I’ll die soon.
Come, Montague.
You’re up early to see your son down early.
Oh, my liege, my wife died tonight.
Sadness over my son’s exile stopped her breath.
What further pain must I endure in my old age?
Look, and you’ll see.  
Be quiet and hold back your remarks of outrage, until we can clear up these questions.
We want to know how it started and what really happened.
And then I’ll be the leader of pain, and maybe I’ll lead you as far as death.
In the meantime, hold on, and be patient.
Bring forth the men under suspicion.
I am the greatest, but I was able to do the least.
I am under the most suspicion, because I was here at the time of this awful murder.
And here I stand, you can question me and punish me.
I have already condemned and excused myself.
Tell us what you know about this affair.
I will be brief because I’m not going to live long enough to tell a boring story.
Romeo, who lies there dead, was the husband of that Juliet.
And she, who lies there dead, was that Romeo’s faithful wife.
I married them; their secret wedding day was the day Tybalt died.
His untimely death caused the bridegroom to be banished from the city.
Juliet was sad because Romeo was gone, not because of Tybalt’s death.
To cure her sadness, you arranged a marriage for her with Count Paris.
Then she came to me, and, looking wild, she asked me to devise a plan to get her out of this second marriage.
She threatened to kill herself in my cell if I didn’t help her.
So I gave her a sleeping potion that I had mixed with my special skills.
It worked as planned.
She seemed to everyone to be dead.
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off.
But the man who carried my letter, Friar John, was held up by an accident.
Last night he gave me the letter back.
So I came here alone at the hour when she was supposed to wake up.
I came to take her out of her family’s tomb, hoping to hide her in my cell until I could make contact with Romeo.
But by the time I got here, just a few minutes before Juliet woke up, Paris and Romeo were already dead.
She woke up, and I asked her to come out of the tomb with me and endure this tragedy with patience.
But then a noise sent me running scared from the tomb.
She was too desperate to come with me, and it seems that she killed herself.
I know all of this.
And her Nurse knows about the marriage too.
If any part of this tragedy is my fault, let my old life be sacrificed and let me suffer the most severe punishment.
We have always known you to be a holy man.
Where’s Romeo’s man?
What does he have to say about this?
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death.
And then he rode from Mantua here to this tomb. 
Give me the letter.
I’ll look at it.
He came with flowers to spread on his lady’s grave.
And he asked me to stand far away and leave him alone, and so I did.
Then someone with a torch came to open the tomb.
So my master drew on him.
And then I ran away to call the watch.
Oh, brother Montague, give me your hand.
This is my daughter’s dowry.
I can ask you for nothing more.
But I can give you more.
I’ll raise her statue in pure gold.
As long as this city is called Verona, there will be no figure praised more than that of true and faithful Juliet.
The statue I will make of Romeo to lie beside his Juliet will be just as rich.
They were poor sacrifices of our rivalry!
We settle a dark peace this morning.
The sun is too sad to show itself.
Let’s go, to talk about these sad things some more.
Some will be pardoned, and some will be punished.
There was never a story more full of pain than the story of Romeo and Juliet.
You both have honorable reputations, and it’s too bad you’ve been enemies for so long.
But what do you say to my request?
I can only repeat what I’ve said before.
My daughter is still very young.
She’s not even fourteen years old.
Let’s wait two more summers before we start thinking she’s ready to get married.
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers.
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon.
But go ahead and charm her, gentle Paris; make her love you.
My permission is only part of her decision.
If she agrees to marry you, my blessing and fair words will confirm her choice.
Tonight I’m having a feast that we’ve celebrated for many years.
I’ve invited many of my closest friends, and I’d like to welcome you and add you to the guest list.
At my humble house tonight, you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below.
In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens.
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide.
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud.
For the next two hours, we will watch the story of their doomed love and their parents' anger, which nothing but the children’s deaths could stop.
If you listen to us patiently, we’ll make up for everything we’ve left out in this prologue onstage.
You’ll be delighted by young women as fresh as spring flowers.
Look at anyone you like, and choose whatever woman seems best to you.
Once you see a lot of girls, you might not think my daughter’s the best anymore.
Come along with me.
Find the people whose names are on this list?
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others' tools, that fisherman should play with paints, and painters should play with with fishing nets.
But I’ve been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list, and I can’t read!
I’ll never find them on my own.
I’ve got to find somebody who knows how to read to help me.
But here come some people, right in the nick of time.  
The  For what, Romeo?
For when you cut your shin.
What?
Romeo, are you crazy?
I’m not crazy, but I’m tied up tighter than a mental patient in a straitjacket.
I’m locked up in a prison and deprived of food.
I’m whipped and tortured— May God give you a good evening.
Excuse me, sir, do you know how to read?
I can read my own fortune in my misery.
Perhaps you’ve learned from life and not from books.
But please tell me, can you read anything you see?
Yes, if I know the language and the letters.
I see.
Well, that’s an  Stay, fellow.
I can read.
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters, Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters, Vitruvio’s widow, Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters, My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.” That’s a nice group of people.
Where are they supposed to come?
Up.
Where?
To supper?
To our house.
Whose house?
My master’s house.
Indeed, I should have asked you before who he was.
Now I’ll tell you so you don’t have to ask.
My master is the great and rich Capulet, and if you don’t belong to the house of Montague, please come and drink a cup of wine.
Have a nice day!
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet’s traditional feast, along with every beautiful woman in Verona.
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I’ll show you.
The woman who you think is as beautiful as a swan is going to look as ugly as a crow to you.
If my eyes ever lie to me like that, let my tears turn into flames and burn them for being such obvious liars!
A woman more beautiful than the one I love?
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began.
Come on, you first decided she was beautiful when no one else was around.
There was no one to compare her to except herself.
But let your eyes compare her to another beautiful woman who I’ll show you at this feast, and you won’t think she’s the best anymore.
I’ll go with you.
Not because I think you’ll show me anything better, but so I can see the woman I love.
Nurse, where’s my daughter?
Tell her to come to me.
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve, I already told her to come.
Come on!
Where is she?
What is she doing?
What, Juliet!
What is it?
Who’s calling me?
Your mother.
Madam, I’m here.
What do you want?
I’ll tell you what’s the matter—Nurse, leave us alone for a little while.
We must talk privately—Nurse, come back here.
I just remembered, you can listen to our secrets.
You know how young my daughter is.
Yes, I know her age down to the hour.
She’s not even fourteen.
I’d bet fourteen of my own teeth—but, I’m sorry to say, I only have four teeth—she’s not fourteen.
How long is it until  Two weeks and a few odd days.
Whether it’s even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she’ll be fourteen.
She and Susan—God rest her and all Christian souls—were born on the same day.
Well, Susan died and is with God.
She was too good for me.
But like I said, on the night of Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen.
Yes, she will.
Indeed, I remember it well.
It’s been eleven years since the earthquake.
She stopped nursing from my breast on that very day.
I’ll never forget it.
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse.
You and your husband were in Mantua.
Boy, do I have some memory!
But like I said, when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast.
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake.
There was no need to tell me to get out of there.
That was eleven years ago.
By then she could stand up all by herself.
No, I swear, by that time she could run and waddle all around.
I remember because she had cut her forehead just the day before.
My husband—God rest his soul, he was a happy man—picked up the child.
Oh,” he said, “Did you fall on your face?
You’ll  Enough of this.
Please be quiet.
Yes ,madam.
But I can’t help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said, “Yes.” I swear, she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster’s testicle.
It was a painful bruise, and she was crying bitterly.
Yes,” said my husband, “Did you fall on your face?
You’ll fall backward when you grow up, won’t you, Jule?” And she stopped crying and said, “Yes.” Now you stop too, Nurse, please.
Peace.
I’m done talking.
May God choose you to receive his grace.
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed.
If I live to see you get married someday, all my wishes will come true.
Well, marriage is exactly what we have to discuss.
Tell me, my daughter Juliet, what is your attitude about getting married?
It is an honor that I do not dream of.
An honor?” If I weren’t your only nurse, I’d say you had sucked wisdom from the breast that fed you.
Well, start thinking about marriage now.
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you—girls from noble families—who have already become mothers.
By my count, I was already your mother at just about your age, while you remain a virgin.
Well then, I’ll say this quickly: the valiant Paris wants you as his bride.
What a man, young lady.
He’s as great a man as any in the whole world.
He’s as perfect as if he were sculpted from wax.
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him.
No, he’s a fine flower, truly, a flower.
Lose nothing?
In fact, you’d get bigger.
Men make women bigger by getting them pregnant.
I’ll look at him and try to like him, at least if what I see is likable.
But I won’t let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows.
Madam, the guests are here, dinner is served, people are calling for you, people have asked for Juliet, and in the pantry, people are cursing the Nurse.
Everything’s out of control.
I must go and serve the guests.
Please, follow straight after me.
We’ll follow you.
Juliet, the count is waiting for you.
Go, girl, look for a man who’ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days.
What will we say is our excuse for being here?
Or should we enter without apologizing?
It’s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that.
We’re not going to introduce our dance by having someone dress up as Cupid, blindfolded and carrying a toy bow to frighten the ladies like a scarecrow.
Nor are we going to recite a memorized speech to introduce ourselves.
Let them judge us however they please.
We’ll give them a dance and then hit the road.
Give me a torch.
I don’t want to dance.
I feel sad, so let me be the one who carries the light.
No, noble Romeo, you’ve got to dance.
Not me, believe me.
You’re wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles.
My soul is made out of lead, and it’s so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can’t move.
You’re a lover.
Take Cupid’s wings and fly higher than the average man.
His arrow has pierced me too deeply, so I can’t fly high with his cheerful feathers.
Because this wound keeps me down, I can’t leap any higher than my dull sadness.
I sink under the heavy weight of love.
Gregory, I swear, we can’t let them humiliate us.
We won’t take their garbage.
What I mean is, if they make us angry we’ll pull out our swords.
Maybe you should focus on pulling yourself out of trouble, Sampson.
I hit hard when I’m angry.
But it’s hard to make you  One of those dogs from the Montague house can make me angry.
Angry enough to run away.
You won’t stand and fight.
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand.
If I pass one of them on the street, I’ll take the side closer to the wall and let him walk in the gutter.
If you sink, you’re dragging love down.
It’s not right to drag down something as tender as love.
Is love really tender?
I think it’s too rough, too rude, too rowdy, and it pricks like a thorn.
If love plays rough with you, play rough with  Come on, let’s knock and go in.
The minute we get in let’s all start dancing.
I’ll take a torch.
Let playful people with light hearts dance.
There’s an old saying that applies to me: you can’t lose if you don’t play the game.
I’ll just hold a torch and watch you guys.
It looks like a lot of fun, but I’ll sit this one out.
Hey, you’re being a stick in the mud, as cautious as a policemen on night patrol.
If you’re a stick in the mud, we’ll pull you out of the mud—I mean out of love, if you’ll excuse me for being so rude—where you’re stuck up to your ears.
Come on, we’re wasting precious daylight.
Let’s go!
No we’re not—it’s night.
I mean, we’re wasting the light of our torches by delaying, which is like wasting the sunshine during the day.
Use your common sense to figure out what I mean, instead of trying to be clever or trusting your five senses.
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball, but it’s not smart of us to go.
Why, may I ask?
I had a dream last night.
So did I.
Well, what was your dream?
My dream told me that dreamers often lie.
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth.
Oh, then I see you’ve been with  Who’s Queen Mab?
She’s the fairies' midwife.
She’s no bigger than the stone on a city councilman’s ring.
She rides around in a wagon drawn by tiny little atoms, and she rides over men’s noses as they lie sleeping.
The spokes of her wagon are made of spiders' legs.
The cover of her wagon is made of grasshoppers' wings.
The harnesses are made of the smallest spiderwebs.
The collars are made out of moonbeams.
Her whip is a thread attached to a cricket’s bone.
Her wagon driver is a tiny bug in a gray coat; he’s not half the size of a little round 
Her chariot is a hazelnut shell.
It was made by a carpenter squirrel or an old grubworm; they’ve made wagons for the fairies as long as anyone can remember.
In this royal wagon, she rides every night through the brains of lovers and makes them dream about love.
She rides over courtiers' knees, and they dream about curtsying.
She rides over lawyers' fingers, and right away, they dream about their fees.
She rides over ladies' lips, and they immediately dream of kisses.
Queen Mab often puts blisters on their lips because their breath smells like candy, which makes her mad.
Sometimes she rides over a courtier’s lips, and he dreams of making money off of someone.
Sometimes she tickles a priest’s nose with a  Enough, enough!
Mercutio, be quiet.
You’re talking nonsense.
True.
I’m talking about dreams, which are the products of a brain that’s doing nothing.
Dreams are nothing but silly imagination, as thin as air, and less predictable than the wind, which sometimes blows on the frozen north and then gets angry and blows south.
The wind you’re talking about is blowing us off our course.
Dinner is over, and we’re going to get there too late.
I’m worried we’ll get there too early.
I have a feeling this party tonight will be the start of something bad, something that will end with my own death.
But whoever’s in charge of where my life’s going can steer me wherever they want.
Onward, lover boys!
Beat the drum.
Where’s Potpan?
Why isn’t he helping us clear the table?
He should be moving and scraping plates!
When only one or two men have all the good manners, and even they are dirty, things are bad.
Take away the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.
You, good friend, save me a piece of marzipan, and if you love me, have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony and Potpan!
Yes, boy, I’m ready.
They’re looking for you in the great chamber.
We can’t be in two places at once, both here and there!
Cheers, boys.
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything.
Welcome, gentlemen.
The ladies who don’t have corns on their toes will dance with you.
Ha, my ladies, which of you will refuse to dance now?
Whichever of you acts shy, I’ll swear she has corns.
Does that hit close to home?
Welcome, gentlemen.
There was a time when I could wear a mask over my eyes and charm a lady by whispering a story in her ear.
That time is gone, gone, gone.
You are welcome gentlemen.
Come on, musicians, play music. 
I swear, it must be thirty years.
What, man?
It’s not that long, it’s not that long.
It’s been since Lucentio’s wedding.
Let the years fly by as fast as they like, it’s only been twenty-five years since we wore masks.
It’s been longer, it’s been longer.
Lucentio’s son is older than that, sir.
He’s thirty years old.
Are you really going to tell me that?
His son was a minor only two years ago.
I don’t know, sir.
Oh, she shows the torches how to burn bright!
She stands out against the darkness like a jeweled earring hanging against the cheek of an African.
Her beauty is too good for this world; she’s too beautiful to die and be buried.
She outshines the other women like a white dove in the middle of a flock of crows.
When this dance is over, I’ll see where she stands, and then I’ll touch her hand with my rough and ugly one.
Did my heart ever love anyone before this moment?
My eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight.
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague.
Why, what’s going on here, nephew?
Why are you acting so angry?
Uncle, this man is a Montague—our enemy.
He’s a scoundrel who’s come here out of spite to mock our party.
Is it young Romeo?
That’s him, that villain Romeo.
Calm down, gentle cousin.
Leave him alone.
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman, and, to tell you the truth, he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man.
I wouldn’t insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town.
So calm down.
Just ignore him.
That’s what I want, and if you respect my wishes, you’ll look nice and stop frowning because that’s not the way you should behave at a feast.
It’s the right way to act when a villain like him shows up.
I won’t tolerate him.
You  But, uncle, we’re being disrespected.
Go on, go on.
You’re an insolent little boy.
Is that how it is, really?
This stupidity will come back to bite you.
I know what I’ll do.
You have to contradict me, do you?
I’ll teach you a lesson.
The combination of forced patience and pure rage is making my body tremble.
I’ll leave here now, but Romeo’s prank, which seems so sweet to him now, will turn bitter to him later.
Good pilgrim, you don’t give your hand enough credit.
By holding my hand you show polite devotion.
After all, pilgrims touch the hands of statues of saints.
Holding one palm against another is like a kiss.
Don’t saints and pilgrims have lips too?
Yes, pilgrim—they have lips that they’re supposed to pray with.
Well then, saint, let lips do what hands do.
I’m praying for you to kiss me.
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn’t turn to despair.
Saints don’t move, even when they grant prayers.
Then don’t move while I act out my prayer.
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours.
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours?
Sin from my lips?
You encourage crime with your sweetness.
Give me my sin back.
You kiss like you’ve studied how.
Madam, your mother wants to talk to you.
Who is her mother?
Indeed, young man, her mother is the lady of the house.
She is a good, wise, and virtuous lady.
I nursed her daughter, whom you were just talking to.
Let me tell you, the man who marries her will become very wealthy.
Yes, but I’m afraid I’m in more trouble than ever.
No gentlemen, don’t get ready to go now.
We have a little dessert coming up. 
That means you’re the weak one, because weaklings get pushed up against the wall.
You’re right.
That’s why girls get pushed up against walls—they’re weak.
So what I’ll do is push the Montague men into the street and the Montague women up against the wall.
The fight is between our masters, and we men who work for them.
It’s all the same.
I’ll be a harsh master to them.
After I fight the men, I’ll be nice to the women—I’ll cut off their heads.
Cut off their heads?
You mean their  Cut off their heads, take their maidenheads—whatever.
Take my remark in whichever sense you like.
The women you rape are the ones who’ll have to “sense” it.
They’ll feel me as long as I can keep an erection.
Everybody knows I’m a nice piece of flesh.
It’s a good thing you’re not a piece of fish.
You’re    Pull out your tool now.
These guys are from the house of Montague.
I have my naked sword out.
Fight, I’ll back you up.
Come over here, nurse.
Who is that gentleman?
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio.
Who’s the one who’s going out the door right now?
Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio.
Who’s the one following over there, the one who wouldn’t dance?
I don’t know his name.
Go ask.
What’s this?
What’s this?
Just a rhyme I learned from somebody I danced with at the party.
Right away, right away.
Come, let’s go.
The strangers are all gone.
Now Romeo’s old feelings of desire are dying, and a new desire is eager to take their place.
Romeo groaned for the beautiful Rosaline and said he would die for her, but compared with tender Juliet, Rosaline doesn’t seem beautiful now.
Now someone loves Romeo, and he’s in love again—both of them falling for each others' good looks.
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy.
And she’s been hooked by someone she should fear.
Because he’s an enemy, Romeo has no chance to see Juliet and say the things a lover normally says.
And Juliet’s just as much in love as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover.
But love gives them power, and time gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure.
Can I go away while my heart stays here?
I have to go back to where my heart is.
He’s a smart boy.
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed.
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall.
Call to him, Mercutio.
I’ll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit.
Romeo!
Madman!
Passion!
Lover!
Show yourself in the form of a sigh.
Speak one rhyme, and I’ll be satisfied.
Just cry out, “Ah me!” Just say “love” and “dove.” Say just one lovely word to my good friend 
If he hears you, you’ll make him angry.
What I’m saying can’t anger him.
He would be angry if I summoned a strange spirit for her to have sex with—that’s what would make him angry.
The things I’m saying are fair and honest.
All I’m doing is saying the name of the woman he loves to lure him out of the darkness.
Come on.
He’s hidden behind these trees to keep the night company.
His love is blind, so it belongs in the dark.
If love is blind, it can’t hit the target.
Now he’ll sit under a  Let’s go.
There’s no point in looking for him if he doesn’t want to be found.
It’s easy for someone to joke about scars if they’ve never been cut.
But wait, what’s that light in the window over there?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Rise up, beautiful sun, and kill the  Don’t be her maid, because she is jealous.
Virginity makes her look sick and green.
Only fools hold on to their virginity.
Let it go.
Oh, there’s my lady!
Oh, it is my love.
Oh, I wish she knew how much I love her.
She’s talking, but she’s not saying anything.
So what?
Her eyes are saying something.
I will answer them.
I am too bold.
She’s not talking to me.
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business, and they’re asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return.
What if her eyes were in the sky and the stars were in her head?—The brightness of her cheeks would outshine the stars the way the sun outshines a lamp.
If her eyes were in the night sky, they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing, thinking her light was the light of day.
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek.
Oh, I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek.
Oh, my!
Who are you?
Why do you hide in the darkness and listen to my private thoughts?
I don’t know how to tell you who I am by telling you a name.
I hate my name, dear saint, because my name is your enemy.
If I had it written down, I would tear up the paper.
I haven’t heard you say a hundred words yet, but I recognize the sound of your voice.
Aren’t you Romeo?
And aren’t you a Montague?
I am neither of those things if you dislike them.
Tell me, how did you get in here?
And why did you come?
The orchard walls are high, and it’s hard to climb over them.
If any of my relatives find you here they’ll kill you because of who you are.
I flew over these walls with the light wings of love.
Stone walls can’t keep love out.
Whatever a man in love can possibly do, his love will make him try to do it.
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle.
If they see you, they’ll murder you.
Alas, one angry look from you would be worse than twenty of your relatives with swords.
Just look at me kindly, and I’m invincible against their hatred.
I’d give anything to keep them from seeing you here.
The darkness will hide me from them.
And if you don’t love me, let them find me here.
I’d rather they killed me than have to live without your love.
Who told you how to get here below my bedroom?
Love showed me the way—the same thing that made me look for you in the first place.
Love told me what to do, and I let love borrow my eyes.
I’m not a sailor, but if you were across the farthest sea, I would risk everything to gain you.
You can’t see my face because it’s dark out.
Otherwise, you’d see me blushing about the things you’ve heard me say tonight.
I would be happy to keep up good manners and deny the things I said.
But forget about good manners.
Do you love me?
I know you’ll say “yes,” and I’ll believe you.
But if you swear you love me, you might turn out to be lying.
They say  Lady, I swear by the sacred moon above, the moon that paints the tops of fruit trees with silver—
Don’t swear by the moon.
The moon is always changing.
Every month its position in the sky shifts.
I don’t want you to turn out to be that inconsistent too.
What should I swear by?
Don’t swear at all.
But if you have to swear, swear by your wonderful self, which is the god I worship like an idol, and then I’ll believe you.
If my heart’s dear love— Well, don’t swear.
Although you bring me joy, I can’t take joy in this exchange of promises tonight.
It’s too crazy.
We haven’t done enough thinking.
It’s too sudden.
It’s too much like lightning, which flashes and then disappears before you can say, “it’s lightning.” My sweet, good night.
Our love, which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air, may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet.
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart.
Oh, are you going to leave me so unsatisfied?
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight?
I would be satisfied if we made each other true promises of love.
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to.
Yet I wish I could take that promise back, so I had it to give again.
You would take it back?
Why would you do that, my love?
Only to be generous and give it to you once more.
But I’m wishing for something I already have.
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea, and my love is as deep.
The more love I give you, the more I have.
Both loves are infinite.
I hear a noise inside.
Dear love, goodbye—Just a minute, good Nurse.
Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay here for a moment.
I’ll come back.
Oh, blessed, blessed night!
Because it’s dark out, I’m afraid all this is just a dream, too sweet to be real.
Three words, dear Romeo, and then it’s good night for real.
If your intentions as a lover are truly honorable and you want to marry me, send me word tomorrow.
I’ll send a messenger to you, and you can pass on a message telling me where and when we’ll be married.
I’ll lay all my fortunes at your feet and follow you, my lord, all over the world.      
How will you back me up—by turning your back and running away?
Don’t worry about me.
No, really.
I  Let’s not break the law by starting a fight.
Let them start something.
I’ll frown at them as they pass by, and they can react however they want.
You mean however they dare.
I’ll bite my thumb at them.
That’s an insult, and if they let me get away with it they’ll be dishonored.
Hey, are you biting your thumb at us?
I’m biting my thumb.
Are you biting your thumb at us?
Are you trying to start a fight?
Start a fight?
No, sir.
Alright, I’m coming!—I beg you to stop trying for me and leave me to my sadness.
Tomorrow I’ll send the messenger.
My soul depends on it— A thousand times good night.
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you.
A lover goes toward his beloved as enthusiastically as a schoolboy leaving his books, but when he leaves his girlfriend, he feels as miserable as the schoolboy on his way to school.
Hist, Romeo!
Hist!
Oh, I wish I could make a  My soul is calling out my name.
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet.
It’s the sweetest sound a lover ever hears.
Romeo!
My baby hawk?
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you?
By nine o'clock.
I won’t fail.
From now until then seems like twenty years.
I have forgotten why I called you back.
Let me stand here until you remember your reason.
I’ll forget it, and you’ll have to stand there forever.
I’ll only remember how much I love your company.
I’ll keep standing here, even if you keep forgetting.
I’ll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here.
It’s almost morning.
I want to make you go, but I’d only let you go as far as a spoiled child lets his pet bird go.
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string.
I wish I was your bird.
My sweet, so do I.
But I would kill you by petting you too much.
Good night, good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I’ll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow.
I hope you sleep peacefully.
I wish I were Sleep and Peace, so I could spend the night with you.
Now I’ll go see my priest, to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck.
The smiling morning is replacing the frowning night.
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun’s path like a drunk man.
Now, before the sun comes up and burns away the dew, I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers.
The Earth is nature’s mother and also nature’s tomb.
Plants are born out of the Earth, and they are buried in the Earth when they die.
From the Earth’s womb, many different sorts of plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment.
Everything nature creates has some special property, and each one is different.
Herbs, plants, and stones possess great power.
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality.
And there is nothing that does not turn bad if it’s put to the wrong use and abused.
Virtue turns to vice if it’s misused.
Vice sometimes becomes virtue through the right activity.
Inside the little rind of this weak flower, there is both poison and powerful medicine.
If you smell it, you feel good all over your body.
But if you taste it, you die.
There are two opposite elements in everything, in men as well as in herbs—good and evil.
When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer.
Good morning, father.
God bless you.
Who greets me so early in the morning?
Young man, something’s wrong if you’re getting out of bed this early.
Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world.
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep.
Therefore, the fact that you’re awake this early tells me you’ve been upset with some anxiety.
If that’s not the case, then this must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight.
Your last guess is right.
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep.
May God forgive you if you’ve sinned!—Were you with Rosaline?
With Rosaline, father?
No, I have forgotten that girl and all the sadness she brought me.
That’s good, my boy.
But where have you been?
I’ll tell you before you have to ask me again.
I have been feasting with my enemy.
Suddenly someone wounded me with love and was wounded with love by me.
You have the sacred power to cure both of us.
I carry no hatred, holy man, because my request will benefit my enemy.
