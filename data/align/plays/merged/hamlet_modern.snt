Of course.
You sell fish.
No, not me, sir.
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller.
Good, sir?
Yes, sir.
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world.
That’s definitely true, my lord.
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog, kissing the corpse—by the way, do you have a daughter?
I do indeed, my lord.
Then by all means never let her walk in public.
Procreation is a good thing, but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out, friend.
A lot of words.
And what is the subject?
Between whom?
I mean, what do the words say?
Oh, just lies, sir.
The sly writer says here that old men have gray beards, their faces are wrinkled, their eyes full of gunk, and that they have no wisdom and weak thighs.
Of course I believe it all, but I don’t think it’s good manners to write it down, since you yourself, sir, would grow as old as I am, if you could only travel backward like a crab.
Into my grave.
Well, that’s certainly out of this world, all right.
You can’t take anything from me that I care less about—except my life, except my life, except my life.
Good-bye, my lord.
You’re looking for Lord Hamlet.
He’s right over there.
Thank you, sir.
My lord!
My dear sir!
Ah, my good old friends!
How are you, Guildenstern?
And Rosencrantz!
Boys, how are you both doing?
Oh, as well as anybody.
Happy that we’re not too happy, lucky in being not too lucky.
We’re not exactly at the top of our luck.
But you’re not down and out, either, are you?
No, we’re just somewhere in the middle, my lord.
So you’re around Lady Luck’s waist?
Yes, we’re the privates in her army.
Ha, ha, so you’ve gotten into her private parts?
Of course—Lady Luck is such a slut.
Anyway, what’s up?
Not much, my lord.
Just that the world’s become honest.
In that case, the end of the world is approaching.
But you’re wrong.
Let me ask you a particular question.
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison?
Prison, my lord?
Denmark’s a prison.
Then I guess the whole world is one.
Yes, quite a large one, with many cells and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst.
We don’t think so, my lord.
Well, then it isn’t one to you, since nothing is really good or bad in itself—it’s all what a person thinks about it.
And to me, Denmark is a prison.
That must be because you’re so ambitious.
It’s too small for your large mind.
Small?
No, I could live in a walnut shell and feel like the king of the universe.
The real problem is that I have bad dreams.
Dreams are a sign of ambition, since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream.
But a dream itself is just a shadow.
Exactly.
In fact, I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it’s only the shadow of a shadow.
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies, while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars.
Should we go inside?
I seem to be losing my mind a bit.
We’re at your service, whatever you say.
No, no, I won’t class you with my servants, since—to be frank with you—my servants are terrible.
But tell me as my friends, what are you doing here at Elsinore?
Visiting you, my lord.
There’s no other reason.
Well, then, I thank you, though I’m such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much.
Did someone tell you to visit me?
Or was it just your whim, on your own initiative?
Come on, tell me the truth.
What should we say, my lord?
Anything you like, as long as it answers my question.
You were sent for.
You’ve got a guilty look on your faces, which you’re too honest to disguise.
I know the king and queen sent for you.
Why would they do that, my lord?
That’s what I want you to tell me.
Let me remind you of our old friendship, our youth spent together, the duties of our love for each other, and whatever else will make you answer me straight.
My lord, we were sent for.
All right, let’s sit down and discuss that question.
Somebody tell me why this strict schedule of guards has been imposed, and why so many bronze cannons are being manufactured in Denmark, and so many weapons bought from abroad, and why the shipbuilders are so busy they don’t even rest on Sunday.
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day?
Who can explain this to me?
I can.
Or at least I can describe the rumors.
As you know, our late king, whom we just now saw as a ghost, was the great rival of Fortinbras, king of Norway.
Fortinbras dared him to battle.
In that fight, our courageous Hamlet (or at least that’s how we thought of him) killed old King Fortinbras, who—on the basis of a valid legal document—surrendered all his territories, along with his life, to his conqueror.
If our king had lost, he would have had to do the same.
But now old Fortinbras’s young son, also called Fortinbras—he is bold, but unproven—has gathered a bunch of thugs from the lawless outskirts of the country.
For some food, they’re eager to take on the tough enterprise of securing the lands the elder Fortinbras lost.
I’ll tell you why—so you won’t have to tell  My lord, I wasn’t thinking anything like that.
So why did you laugh when I said that men don’t interest me?
I was just thinking that if people don’t interest you, you’ll be pretty bored by the actors on their way here.
We crossed paths with a drama company just a while ago, and they’re coming to entertain you.
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome.
I’ll treat him like a real king.
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield, the lover will be rewarded for his sighs, the crazy character can rant all he wants, the clown will make everybody laugh, and the lady character can say whatever’s on her mind, or I’ll stop the play.
Which troupe is it?
The tragic actors from the city, the ones you used to enjoy so much.
What are they doing on the road?
They made more money and got more attention in the city.
But things have changed there, and it’s easier for them on the road now.
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city?
Do they attract big audiences?
No, not like before.
Why?
Are they getting rusty?
No, they’re busy and as excellent as ever.
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it.
These child actors are now in fashion, and they’ve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all, they’re so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys.
What, you mean kid actors?
Who takes care of them?
Who pays their way?
Will they stop working when their voices mature?
Aren’t the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors, which they are going to grow up and become?
Unless, of course, they have trust funds.
There’s been a whole debate on the topic.
For a while, no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children’s playwright and the actors playing adult roles.
Are you kidding?
Oh, there’s been a lot of quarreling.
And the boys are winning so far?
Yes, they are, my lord—little boys are carrying the whole theater on their backs, like Hercules carried the world.
Actually, it’s not so unusual when you think about it.
My uncle is king of Denmark, and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him.
There’s something downright unnatural about it, if a philosopher stopped to think about it.
The actors are here.
Gentlemen, welcome to Elsinore.
Don’t be shy—shake hands with me.
If I’m going to welcome you I have to go through all these polite customs, don’t I?
And if we don’t shake hands, when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I’m happier to see them than you.
You are very welcome here.
But still, my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea.
In what sense, my lord?
I’m only crazy sometimes.
At other times, I know what’s what.
Gentlemen, I hope you are well.
Listen, Guildenstern, and you too, Rosencrantz—listen as close as you can!
Yes, the second time around, since, as they say, old people become children again.
My lord, I have news for you.
My lord, I have news for you.
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome — The actors have arrived, my lord.
Yawn, snore.
I swear— —each actor arrived on his ass.
They are the best actors in the world, either for  Oh,  What treasure did he have, my lord?
Well,        Aren’t I right, Jephthah, old man?
If you’re calling me Jephthah, my lord, I do have a daughter I love more than anything, yes.
What is logical, then, my lord?
Why,
and then, you know,   If you want to know more, you can refer to the popular song, because now I have to stop.
Welcome, welcome to all of you.
Which speech, my lord?
I heard you recite a speech for me once that was never acted out, or if it was, it was performed only once, since the play was not popular—like caviar for a slob who couldn’t appreciate it.
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play, with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy. 
I remember one critic said there was no vulgar language to spice up the dialogue, and showing off on playwright’s part.
That critic called it an excellent play, containing things to reflect upon as well as sweet music to enjoy.
I loved one speech in particular.
It was when    No, that’s wrong; it begins like this:                           Sir, take it from there.
My God, that was well done, my lord, with the right accent and a good ear.

This speech is going on too long.
We’ll have the barber trim it later, along with your beard.
Please, continue, players.
This old man only likes the dancing or the sex scenes; he sleeps through all the rest.
Go on, come to the part about Hecuba.
The muffled queen”?
That’s good.
The muffled queen” is good.
Look how flushed the actor is, with tears in his eyes.
All right, that’s enough, please.
My lord, I will give them all they deserve.
Good heavens, man, give them more than that!
If you pay everyone what they deserve, would anyone ever escape a whipping?
Treat them with honor and dignity.
The less they deserve, the more your generosity is worth.
Lead them inside.
Come, everyone.
Follow him, friends.
We’ll watch a whole play tomorrow.
Yes, my lord.
Then we’ll see that tomorrow night.
By the way, if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play, you could learn it by heart for tomorrow, right?
Yes, my lord.
Very well.
Follow that gentleman now, and be careful not to make fun of him.
My good friends, I’ll see you tomorrow.
Welcome to Elsinore.
Yes, my lord.
Ah yes, good-bye to you both.
Now I’m alone.
Oh, what a mean low-life I am!
It’s awful that this actor could force his soul to feel made-up feelings in a work of make-believe.
He grew pale, shed real tears, became overwhelmed, his voice breaking with feeling and his whole being, even, meeting the needs of his act—and all for nothing.
For Hecuba!
As far as I understand, that’s why we’re posted here tonight and why there’s such a commotion in Denmark lately.
I think that’s exactly right—that explains why the ghost of the late king would haunt us now, since he caused these wars.
The ghost is definitely something to worry about.
In the high and mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish.
There were shooting stars, and blood mixed in with the morning dew, and threatening signs on the face of the sun.
The moon, which controls the tides of the sea, was so eclipsed it almost went completely out.
And we’ve had similar omens of terrible things to come, as if heaven and earth have joined together to warn us what’s going to happen.
Wait, look!
It has come again.
I’ll meet it if it’s the last thing I do.
Stay here, you hallucination!
If you have a voice or can make sounds, speak to me.
What is Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he would weep for her?
Just imagine what he would do if he had the cause for feeling that I do.
He would drown the stage with his tears and burst the audience’s ears with his terrible words, drive the guilty spectators crazy, terrify the innocent ones, confuse the ignorant ones, and astound absolutely everyone’s eyes and ears.
But what do I, a grim and uncourageous rascal, do?
Mope around like a dreamer, not even bothering with plans for revenge, and I can say nothing—nothing at all—on behalf of a king whose dear life was stolen.
Am I a coward?
Is there anyone out there who’ll call me “villain” and slap me hard?
Pull off my beard?
Pinch my nose?
Call me the worst liar?
By God, if someone would do that to me, I’d take it, because I’m a lily-livered man—otherwise, I would’ve fattened up the local vultures with the intestines of that low-life king a long time ago.
Bloody, inhuman villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain!
Ah, revenge!
What an ass I am.
I’m so damn brave.
My dear father’s been murdered, and I’ve been urged to seek revenge by heaven and hell, and yet all I can do is stand around cursing like a whore in the streets.
Damn it!
I need to get myself together here!
Hmm….
I’ve heard that guilty people watching a play have been so affected by the artistry of the scene that they are driven to confess their crimes out loud.
Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak.
I’ll have these actors perform something like my father’s murder in front of my uncle.
I’ll watch my uncle.
I’ll probe his conscience and see if he flinches.
If he becomes pale, I know what to do.
The ghost I saw may be the devil, and the devil has the power to assume a pleasing disguise, and so he may be taking advantage of my weakness and sadness to bring about my damnation.
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with.
The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king.
And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy?
He admits he feels confused, but refuses to say why.
And he’s not exactly eager to be interrogated.
He’s very sly and dances around our questions when we try to get him to talk about how he feels.
Did he treat you well when you saw him?
Yes, in a very gentlemanly way.
But it seemed like he had to force himself to be nice to us.
He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at length.
Did you try tempting him with some entertainment?
Madam, some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here.
We told Hamlet about them, and that seemed to do him good.
They are here at court now, and I believe they’ve been told to give a performance for him tonight.
It’s true, and he asked me to beg you both to attend.
It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested.
Gentlemen, please try to sharpen his interest even more, and let this play do him some good.
We will, my lord.
Dear Gertrude, please give us a moment alone.
We’ve secretly arranged for Hamlet to come here so that he can run into Ophelia.
Her father and I, justifiably acting as spies, will hide in the room and observe Hamlet’s behavior, to determine whether it’s love that’s making him suffer.
Yes, I’ll go.
As for you, Ophelia, I hope that your beauty is the reason for Hamlet’s insane behavior, just as I hope your virtues will return him to normal some day, for the good of both of you.
I hope so too, Madam.
Ophelia, come here.—   I hear him coming.
Quick, let’s hide, my lord.
The question is: is it better to be alive or dead?
Is it nobler to put up with all the nasty things that luck throws your way, or to fight against all those troubles by simply putting an end to them once and for all?
Dying, sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for.
To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe to dream.
Ah, but there’s the catch: in death’s sleep who knows what kind of dreams might come, after we’ve put the noise and commotion of life behind us.
That’s certainly something to worry about.
That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long.
After all, who would put up with all life’s humiliations—the abuse from superiors, the insults of arrogant men, the pangs of unrequited love, the inefficiency of the legal system, the rudeness of people in office, and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad—when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits?
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life, unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death, the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns, which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t?
Fear of death makes us all cowards, and our natural boldness becomes weak with too much thinking.
Actions that should be carried out at once get misdirected, and stop being actions at all.
But  Hello, my lord, how have you been doing lately?
Very well, thank you.
Well, well, well.
My lord, I have some mementos of yours that I’ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now.
Please take them.
No, it wasn’t me.
I never gave you anything.
My lord, you know very well that you did, and wrote letters to go along with them, letters so sweetly written that they made your gifts even more valuable.
Their perfume is gone now, so take them back.
Nice gifts lose
their value when the givers turn out not to be so nice.
There, my lord.
Ha ha, are you good?
Excuse me?
Are you beautiful?
My lord, what are you talking about?
I’m just saying that if you’re good and beautiful, your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty.
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness?
Sure, since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin.
This used to be a great puzzle, but now I’ve solved it.
I used to love you.
You certainly made me believe you did, my lord.
You shouldn’t have believed me, since we’re all rotten at the core, no matter how hard we try to be virtuous.
I didn’t love you.
Then I guess I was misled.
Get yourself to a 
I am arrogant, vengeful, ambitious, with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts, and more than I have time to carry it out in.
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven?
Every one of us is a criminal.
Don’t believe any of us.
Hurry to a convent.
Where’s your father?
He’s at home, my lord.
Lock him in, so he can play the fool in his own home only.
Good-bye.
Oh, dear God, please help him!
If you marry, I’ll give you this curse as your wedding present—be as clean as ice, as pure as the driven snow, and you’ll still get a bad reputation.
Get yourself to a convent, at once.
Good-bye.
Or if you have to get married, marry a fool, since wise men know far too well that you’ll cheat on them.
Good-bye.
Dear God, please make him normal again!
I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too.
God gives you one face, but you paint another on top of it.
You dance and prance and lisp; you call God’s creations by pet names, and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance.
Come on, I won’t stand for it anymore.
It’s driven me crazy.
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage.
Whoever is already married (except one person I know) will stay married—all but one person.
Everyone else will have to stay single.
Get yourself to a convent, fast.
Oh, how noble his mind used to be, and how lost he is now!
He used to have a gentleman’s grace, a scholar’s wit, and a soldier’s strength.
He used to be the jewel of our country, the obvious heir to the throne, the one everyone admired and imitated.
And now he has fallen so low!
And of all the miserable women who once enjoyed hearing his sweet, seductive words, I am the most miserable.
A mind that used to sing so sweetly is now completely out of tune, making harsh sounds instead of fine notes.
The unparalleled appearance and nobility he had in the full bloom of his youth has been ruined by madness.
O, how miserable I am to see Hamlet now and know what he was before!
Love?
His feelings don’t move in that direction.
And his words, although they were a little disorganized, weren’t crazy.
No, his sadness is hatching something, like a hen does sitting on an egg.
What hatches very well may be dangerous.
So to prevent any harm being done, I’ve made a quick executive decision: he’ll be sent to England to try to get back the money they owe us.
With any luck, the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind.
What do you think of this plan?
It should work.
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love.—Hello, Ophelia.
You don’t have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
We heard everything.—My lord, do whatever you like, but if you like this idea, let his mother the queen get him alone and beg him to share his feelings with her.
I’ll hide and listen in.
If she can’t find out what his secret is, then send him off to England or wherever you think best.
That’s how we’ll do it, then.
When important people start to show signs of insanity, you have to watch them closely.
If there’s any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor, speak to me.
If you have some secret knowledge of your country’s sad fate—which might be avoided if we knew about it—then, please, speak.
Or if you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere, which they say often makes ghosts restless, then tell us about it.
Stay and speak!
Keep it from leaving, Marcellus.
Should I strike it with my spear?
Yes, if it doesn’t stand still.
It’s over here.
There it is.
It’s gone.
We were wrong to threaten it with violence, since it looks so much like a king.
Besides, we can’t hurt it anymore than we can hurt the air.
Our attack was stupid, futile, and wicked.
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed.
Perform the speech just as I taught you, musically and smoothly.
If you exaggerate the words the way some actors do, I might as well have some newscaster read the lines.
Don’t use too many hand gestures; just do a few, gently, like this.
When you get into a whirlwind of passion on stage, remember to keep the emotion moderate and smooth.
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds, bursting everyone’s eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse, who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows.
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical.
That’s as bad as those old plays in which King Herod ranted.
Please avoid doing that.
I will, sir.
But don’t be too tame, either—let your good sense guide you.
Fit the action to the word and the word to the action.
Act natural at all costs.
Exaggeration has no place in the theater, where the purpose is to represent reality, holding a mirror up to virtue, to vice, and to the spirit of the times.
If you handle this badly, it just makes ignorant people laugh while regular theater-goers are miserable—and they’re the ones you should be keeping happy.
I’ve seen actors who are highly praised, but who—not to be too rude here—can’t even talk or walk like human beings.
They bellow and strut about like weird animals that were made to look like men, but very badly.
I hope we’ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company, sir.
Oh, correct it completely.
Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib, since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them, while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed.
It’s bad behavior for an actor, anyway, and displays a pitiful ambition to hog the limelight on stage.
So, my lord, will the king be attending the performance?
Yes, he will, and the queen as well.
Tell the actors to hurry.
Will you two help them get ready?
Yes, my lord.
Well, hello there, Horatio!
Here I am at your service, my dear lord.
Horatio, you’re the best man I’ve ever known.
Oh, sir— Don’t think I’m flattering you.
What could I hope to get from you, who’ve got nothing but your charm to support you in life?
Why would anyone flatter a poor person?
No, keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well.
You understand?
Ever since I’ve been a free agent in my choice of friends, I’ve chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance, grateful for both good and bad.
Blessed are those who mix emotion with reason in just the right proportion, making them strong enough to resist the whims of Lady Luck.
Show me the person who’s master of his emotions, and I’ll put him close to my heart—in my heart of hearts—as I do you.
But I’m talking too much.
The point is, there’s a play being performed for the king tonight.
One of the scenes comes very close to depicting the circumstances of my father’s death, as I described them to you.
Watch my uncle carefully when that scene begins.
If his guilty secret does not reveal itself, then that ghost was just a devil, and my hunch wasn’t, in fact, worth anything.
Watch him closely.
I’ll stare at him too, and afterward we’ll compare notes on him.
My lord, I’ll watch him as closely as I would a thief.
I won’t miss a trick.
They’re coming.
I can’t talk now.
Take your seat.
So how’s my nephew Hamlet doing?
Wonderful!
I eat the air, like chameleons do.
I’m positively stuffed with air, I eat so much of it.
I have no idea what you’re talking about, Hamlet.
You’re not answering my question.
Mine, neither.
Indeed I did, my lord.
I was considered to be quite a good actor.
What role did you play?
I played Julius Caesar.
I was killed in the Capitol.
Brutus killed me.
That was brutish of them, to kill so capital a guy.
Are the actors ready?
Yes, my lord.
They’re ready whenever you are.
Come here, my dear Hamlet.
Sit by me.
No thanks, my good mother.
There’s a nicer piece of work right here.
My lady, should I lie in your lap?
No, my lord.
I mean, with my head in your lap?
Yes, my lord.
Did you think I was talking about sex?
I think  That’s a nice thought to lie between a girl’s legs.
What is, my lord?
Nothing.
You’re in a good mood tonight, my lord.
Who, me?
Yes, my lord.
Oh God—who is, by the way, the best comic of them all.
What can you do but be happy?
Look how cheerful my mother is, only two hours after my father died.
No, my lord, it’s been four months.
As long as that?
Well, in that case these mourning clothes can go to hell.
I’ll get myself a fur-trimmed suit.
Good heavens, he died two months ago and hasn’t been forgotten yet?
In that case, there’s reason to hope a man’s memory may outlive him by six months.
But he’s got to build churches for that to happen, my lady, or else he’ll have to put up with being forgotten, like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes, “Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, the hobby-horse is forgotten.”   What does this mean, my lord?
This means we’re having some mischievous fun.
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play.
This guy will tell us everything.
Actors can’t keep a secret.
They’ll tell all.
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant?
Sure, or anything else you show him.
As long as you aren’t ashamed to show it, he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means.
You’re naughty.
I’m watching the play.
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring?
It was a bit short, my lord.
Yes, as short as a woman’s love.


Nice vow, but what if she breaks it?
Madam, how are you liking this play?
The lady’s overdoing it, I think.
Oh, but she’ll keep her word.
Do you know the plot?
Is there anything offensive in it?
No, no, it’s just a joke, a little jibe but all in good fun.
Not offensive at all.
What’s the play called?
And then it acted startled, like a guilty person caught by the law.
I’ve heard that the rooster awakens the god of day with its trumpetlike crowing, and makes all wandering ghosts, wherever they are, hurry back to their hiding places.
We’ve just seen proof of that.
Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed.
Some people say that just before Christmas the rooster crows all night long, so that no ghost dares go wandering, and the night is safe.
The planets have no sway over us, fairies' spells don’t work, and witches can’t bewitch us.
That’s how holy that night is.
Yes, I’ve heard the same thing and sort of believe it.
But look, morning is breaking beyond that hill in the east, turning the sky red.
Let’s interrupt our watch and go tell young Hamlet what we’ve seen tonight.
I’m sure this ghost that’s so silent with us will speak to him.
Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this, out of duty and love?
Let’s do it.
I know where we’ll find him this morning.
This is Lucianus, the king’s nephew in the play.
You’re an expert commentator, aren’t you?
Yes.
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me.
Ooh, you’re sharp.
Yes, pointy, but you could take the edge off me— though it might make you moan a little.
You get better in your jokes and worse in your manners.
That’s what you women get when you trick us into marriage.—Let’s get started, murderer on stage, please!
Damn it, stop fussing with the makeup, and get going.
We’re all waiting for the revenge!  
You see, he poisons the king in his own garden to get the kingdom for himself.
The king’s name is Gonzago.
The original story was written in the finest Italian.
You’ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago’s wife.
The king is getting up.
What—is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank?
My lord, how are you feeling?
Stop the play.
Turn on the lights.
Get me out of here!
Lights, lights, get us some lights!
Couldn’t I get work as an actor (if I hit a run of bad luck) in some acting company, and wear flowers on my shoes?
They might even give you half a share of the company.
No, a whole share for me.

You could have at least  Oh, Horatio, I’ll bet you a thousand bucks the ghost was right.
Did you notice?
Yes, I did, my lord.
When the actors were talking about poison?
I watched him very closely.
Ah ha!
Hey, let’s have some music here!
Play your flutes!
Come on, music!
My lord, could I have a word with you?
You can have a whole story, not just a word.
Sir, the king— Yes, what about him?
He’s in his chambers now, and he’s extremely upset.
What, an upset stomach from too much booze?
No, sir, he’s angry.
You should be smart enough to tell this to a doctor, not me, since if I treated him, he’d just get angrier.
My lord, please try to stick to the subject at hand.
I’ll be good, sir.
Go ahead.
The queen your mother is upset, and sent me to see you.
It’s lovely to see you.
No, my lord, your polite words are not to the point.
If you could please stop fooling around, I’ll tell you what your mother wants.
If not, I’ll leave you alone and that’ll be the end of my business.
Sir, I can’t.
Can’t what, my lord?
Stop fooling around.
My mind is confused.
But I’ll do my best to give you a straight answer, as you wish—or rather, as my mother wishes.
Okay, to the point.
My mother, you say …?
She says that your behavior has astonished her.
Oh, what a wonderful son, I can impress my mother!
But what’s the upshot of her admiration?
Do tell.
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed.
I’d obey even if she were my mother ten times over.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
My lord, you used to like me.
And still do, I swear by my hands.
My lord, what’s wrong with you?
You’re not doing yourself any good by refusing to tell your friends what’s bothering you.
Sir, I have no future ahead of me.
But how can you say that, when the king himself says you’re the heir to the Danish throne?
Yes, eventually, but as the proverb goes,  Oh, my lord, I’m sorry if I’m forgetting my manners.
It’s just that I’m worried about you.
I don’t really understand what you mean.
Will you play this recorder?
I can’t, my lord.
Please.
I’m serious, I can’t.
I’m begging you.
I have no idea how.
Oh, it’s as easy as lying.
Just put your fingers and thumb over the holes and blow into it, and it’ll produce the most moving music.
Here, the holes are here.
But I can’t play a melody.
I don’t know how.
Well, look how you play me—as if you knew exactly where to put your fingers, to blow the mystery out of me, playing all the octaves of my range—and yet you can’t even produce music from this little instrument?
My God, do you think I’m easier to manipulate than a pipe?
You can push my buttons, but you can’t play me for a fool.
Hello and God bless you, sir.
My lord, the queen wants to speak with you right away.
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel?
By God, it does look like a camel.
To me it looks like a weasel.
It does have a back like a weasel’s.
Or like a whale.
Yes, very much like a whale.
I’ll go see my mother soon.
I’ll tell her.
It’s easy enough to say “soon.” Now please leave me alone, my friends.
This is the time of night when witches come out, when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out.
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight.
But I’ve got to go see my mother.—Oh, heart, don’t grow weak, like 
I’ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her, but I won’t use one on her.
And so, my words and thoughts will be at odds.
I don’t like the way he’s acting, and it’s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control.
So get prepared.
I’m sending you to England on diplomatic business, and Hamlet will go with you.
As king, I cannot risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour.
We’ll take care of it.
It’s a sacred duty to protect the lives of all those who depend on Your Highness.
Everyone tries to avoid harm, but the public figure demands even more protection.
When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him.
He’s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things—when it falls down the mountain, every little object goes down with it.
Whenever a king sighs, everyone groans.
Prepare yourself, please, for this trip.
We’ll put a leash on this danger that’s now running wild.
We’ll hurry.
My lord, Hamlet’s going to his mother’s room.
I’ll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say.
I bet she’ll chew him out.
And as you said (and you said it wisely), it’s good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them, since she can be too partial to him.
Goodbye, my lord.
I’ll stop by before you go to bed, and tell you what I’ve heard.
Thanks, my dear lord.
Oh, my crime is so rotten it stinks all the way to heaven.
It has the mark of 
Although I still have fresh memories of my brother the elder Hamlet’s death, and though it was proper to mourn him throughout our kingdom, life still goes on—I think it’s wise to mourn him while also thinking about my own well being.
Therefore, I’ve married my former sister-in-law, the queen, with mixed feelings of happiness and sadness.
I know that in marrying Gertrude I’m only doing what all of you have wisely advised all along—for which I thank you.
Now, down to business.
You all know what’s happening.
Young Fortinbras, underestimating my strength or imagining that the death of the king has thrown my country into turmoil, dreams of getting the better of me, and never stops pestering me with demands that I surrender the territory his father lost to the elder Hamlet, my dead brother-in-law.
So much for Fortinbras.
Now, here’s what needs to be done.
That won’t work, since I’m still reaping the rewards of that murder: my crown and my queen.
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime?
In this wicked world, criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law, shoving justice aside.
But not in heaven.
Up there, every action is judged for exactly what it’s worth, and we’re forced to confront our crimes.
So what can I do?
What is there left to do?
Offer whatever repentance I can—that couldn’t hurt.
But it can’t help either!
Oh, what a lousy situation I’m in.
My heart’s as black as death.
My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks.
Help me, angels!
C’mon, make an effort.
Bend, stubborn knees.
Steely heart, be soft as a newborn babe, so I can pray.
Perhaps everything will turn out okay after all.
I could do it easily now.
He’s praying now.
And now I’ll do it. 
So is it really revenge for me if I kill Claudius right when he is confessing his sins, in perfect condition for a trip to heaven?
No.
Away, sword, and wait for a better moment to kill him.   
He’ll come right away.
Make sure you lay into him.
Tell him his pranks have caused too much trouble, and that Your Highness has taken a lot of heat for them.
I’ll be right here, silent.
Please be blunt with him.
Don’t worry, I’ll do what you say.
Now hide, I hear him coming.
Now mother, what’s this all about?
Hamlet, you’ve insulted your father.
Mother, you’ve insulted my father.
Come on, you’re answering me foolishly.
Go on, you’re questioning me evilly.
Hamlet, what, why?
What’s the problem now?
Have you forgotten who I am?
For God’s sake no, I haven’t.
You are the queen, your husband’s brother’s wife, and you are my mother, though I wish you weren’t.
In that case I’ll call in others who can still speak.
No, sit down.
You won’t budge until I hold a mirror up to you, where you will see what’s deep inside you.
What are you going to do?
You won’t kill me, will you?
Help!
What’s this, a rat?
I’ll bet a buck he’s a dead rat now.
Oh my God, what have you done?
I don’t know.
Is it the king?
Oh, what a senseless, horrible act!
A horrible act—almost as bad, my good mother, as killing a king and marrying his brother.
Killing a king?
That’s what I said, my good woman.
You low-life, nosy, busybody fool, goodbye.
I thought you were somebody more important.
You’ve gotten what you deserve.
I guess you found out it’s dangerous to be a busybody.
What have I done that you dare to talk to me so rudely?
A deed that destroys modesty, turns virtue into hypocrisy, replaces the blossom on the face of true love with a nasty blemish, makes marriage vows as false as a gambler’s oath—oh, you’ve done a deed that plucks the soul out of marriage and turns religion into meaningless blather.
Heaven looks down on this earth, as angry as if Judgment Day were here, and is sick at the thought of what you’ve done.
C’mon, what’s this deed that sounds so awful even before I know what it is?
Look at this picture here, and that one there,  A figure and a combination of good qualities that seemed like every god had set his stamp on this man.
That was your husband.
Now look at this other one.
Here is your present husband, like a mildewed ear of corn infecting the healthy one next to it.
Do you have eyes?
How could you leave the lofty heights of this man here and descend as low as this one?
Ha!
Do you have eyes?
You cannot say you did it out of love, since at your age romantic passions have grown weak, and the heart obeys reason.
But what reason could move you from this one to that one?
You must have some sense in your head, since you’re able to get around, but it seems to be paralyzed, since even if you were crazy you would know the difference between these two men.
No one ever went so insane that they couldn’t get an easy choice like this one right.
What devil was it that blindfolded you?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, ears without hands or eyes, smell without anything else, the use of even one impaired sense would not permit such a mistake as yours.
Oh, for shame, why aren’t you blushing?
If evil can overtake even an old mother’s bones, then let it melt my own.
It turns out it’s no longer shameful to act on impulse—now that the old are doing so, and now that reason is a servant to desire.
Oh, Hamlet, stop!
You’re making me look into my very soul, where the marks of sin are so thick and black they will never be washed away.
Yes, and you lie in the sweaty stench of your dirty sheets, wet with corruption, making love—
Oh, you must stop!
Your words are like daggers.
Please, no more, sweet Hamlet.
A murderer and a villain, a low-life who’s not worth a twentieth of a tenth of your first husband—the worst of kings, a thief of the throne, who took the precious crown from a shelf and put it in his pocket— Stop!
A ragtag king— Oh, angels in heaven, protect me with your wings!—What can I do for you, my gracious lord?
Oh no!
Hamlet’s gone completely crazy.
Have you come to scold your tardy son for straying from his mission, letting your important command slip by?
Tell me!
Don’t forget.
I’ve come to sharpen your somewhat dull appetite for revenge.
But look, your mother is in shock.
Oh, keep her struggling soul from being overwhelmed by horrid visions.
The imagination works strongest in those with the weakest bodies.
Talk to her, Hamlet.
How are you doing, madam?
And how are  At him, at him!
Look how pale he is and how he glares at me.
Preaching even at stones, he could get them to act.
Who are you talking to?
You don’t see anything?
Nothing at all, but I can see everything that’s here.
And you don’t hear anything?
No, nothing but us talking.
Look, look how it’s sneaking away!
My father, dressed just like he was when he was alive!
Look, he’s going out the door right now!
This is only a figment of your imagination.
Madness is good at creating hallucinations.
Madness?
My heart beats just as evenly as yours does.
There’s nothing crazy in what I’ve just uttered.
Put me to the test.
I’ll rephrase everything I’ve just said, which a lunatic couldn’t do.
Mother, for the love of God, don’t flatter yourself into believing that it’s my madness, not your crime, that’s the problem.
You’d just be concealing the rot that’s eating you from the inside.
Confess your sins to heaven.
Repent and avoid damnation.
Don’t spread manure over the weeds in your heart; it’ll only make them more filthy.
Forgive me my good intentions here since in these fat and spoiled times, virtuous people have to say, “Beg your pardon” to vile ones and beg for the chance to do any good.
Oh Hamlet, you’ve broken my heart in two!
Then throw away the worse half, and live a purer life with the other!
Good night to you.
But don’t go to my uncle’s bed tonight.
At least pretend to be virtuous, even if you’re not.
Habit is a terrible thing, in that it’s easy to get used to doing evil without feeling bad about it.
But it’s also a good thing, in that being good can also become a habit.
Say no to sex tonight, and that will make it easier to say no the next time, and still easier the time after that.
Habit can change even one’s natural instincts, and either rein in the devil in us, or kick him out.
Once again, good night to you, and when you want to repent, I’ll ask you for your blessing too.
I’m sorry about what happened to this gentleman 
God wanted to punish me with this murder, and this man with me, so I’m both Heaven’s executioner and its minister of justice.
This is bad, but it’ll get worse soon.
Oh, and one other thing, madam.
What should I do?
Whatever you do, don’t do this: let the fat king seduce you into his bed again, so he can pinch your cheek, call you his bunny, and with filthy kisses and a massage of your neck with his damned fingers, make you admit that my madness is fake, all calculated.
What a great idea that would be, because why would a fair, sober, wise queen hide such things from a toad, a pig, a monster like him?
Who would do that?
No, no, it’s  You can rest easy, since words are made of breath, and breathing requires that you be alive.
I feel too dead to breathe a word of what you’ve told me.
I’ve written to Fortinbras’s uncle, the present head of Norway, an old bedridden man who knows next to nothing about his nephew’s plans.
I’ve told the uncle to stop those plans, which he has the power to do, since all the troops assembled by young Fortinbras are Norwegian, and thus under the uncle’s control.
I’m giving the job of delivering this letter to you, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand.
Your business in Norway will be limited to this task.
We’ll do our duty to you in that and everything else.
I have no doubt you will.
Good-bye.
And now, Laertes, what do you have to tell me?
You have a favor you to ask of me.
What is it, Laertes?
You’ll never waste your words when talking to the king of Denmark.
What could you ever ask for that I wouldn’t give you?
Your father and the Danish throne are as close as the mind and the heart, or the hand and the mouth.
What would you like, Laertes?
My lord, I want your permission to go back to France, which I left to come to Denmark for your coronation.
I confess, my thoughts are on France, now that my duty is done.
Please, let me go.
I have to go to England, don’t you know that?
Ah, I’d forgotten all about that!
It’s been decided.
Yes, it’s a done deal, the documents are ready, and my two schoolmates, whom I trust about as much as rattlesnakes, are in charge.
They’re the ones who’ll lead me on my march to mischief.
Let it happen.
It’s fun to watch the engineer get blown up by his own explosives, and with any luck I’ll dig a few feet below their bombs and blow them to the moon.
Oh, it’s nice to kill two birds with one stone.

Ah, my lord, you wouldn’t believe what I’ve witnessed tonight!
What, Gertrude?
How is Hamlet?
As mad as the waves and the wind when they struggle together in a storm.
In an insane rage, he hears something behind the tapestry, whips out his sword, shouts, “A rat, a rat!” and in his deranged state of mind he kills the good old man, who is still hidden.
Oh, this is terrible!
It would’ve happened to me if I’d been there.
His wildness is a threat to all of us—to you, to me, to everyone.
How will we deal with this violent deed?
I’m the one who will be blamed for not restraining and confining this mad young man.
But I loved him so much I didn’t want to think about what I had to do.
So, like someone suffering from a nasty disease who refuses to divulge his condition and lets it infect him to
the core, I kept Hamlet’s condition secret and let it grow more and more dangerous.
Where has he gone?
To remove the corpse of the man he killed.
His madness allows a glimmering of morality to shine through, like a vein of gold in a chunk of coal.
He weeps for what he has done.
Oh, Gertrude, let’s go.
As soon as the sun sets we’ll ship him off to England.
It’ll take all my diplomatic know-how to explain and excuse the murder he’s committed.
Hey, Guildenstern!
My friends, go find others to help you.
Hamlet in his madness has killed Polonius and dragged him out of his mother’s bedroom.
Go find him and speak nicely to him, and bring the corpse into the chapel.
Please hurry.
Come, Gertrude.
We’ll confer with our wisest friends and tell them what we’re going to do, and what terrible deed has been done already.
Let’s hope slander—a bullet that can travel halfway around the world and still hit its exact target—spares us.
Oh, we must go.
I’m full of confusion and despair.
The body is safely hidden.
What’s that noise?
Who’s calling for Hamlet?
Oh, here they come.
What have you done with the corpse, my lord?
I’ve gotten it dirty—ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.
But tell us where it is, so we can take it to the chapel.
Don’t believe it.
Believe what?
That I’d take your advice rather than keep my own secret.
Besides, you’re a sponge!
What is the son of a king supposed to say to a sponge?
You think I’m a sponge, my lord?
Yes, sir, a sponge that soaks up the king’s approval, his rewards, and his decisions.
Officers like that give the king the best service in the end.
He keeps them in his mouth like an ape.
First he moves them around, then he swallows them.
When he needs what you have found out, he can just squeeze you like a sponge and you’ll be dry again.
I don’t follow, my lord.
I’m glad about that.
Sly words are never understood by fools.
My lord, you have to tell us where the body is, and then go with us to see the king.
The body’s with the king, but the king’s not with the body.
The king’s a thing … A “thing,” my lord?
A thing of no importance.
Take me to him.
Ready or not, here I come!
I’ve sent men to find him and retrieve the body.
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose!
But we can’t throw him in jail.
The people love him, because they judge based on appearance rather than reason.
They’ll pay attention to the severity of the punishment, not the severity of the crime.
No, we must seem calm and fair-minded, and our sending him away must seem like a carefully considered move.
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all.
So what’s happened?
We can’t get him to tell us where he’s put the body.
But where is he?
Outside, my lord, under guard, waiting for your orders.
Bring him to me.
Hey, Guildenstern!
Bring in my lord.
Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?
At dinner.
At dinner where?
Not where he’s eating, but where he’s being eaten.
A certain  Oh no, oh no!
A man can fish with the worm that ate a king, and then eat the fish he catches with that worm.
What do you mean by that?
Nothing much, just to demonstrate that a king can move through the bowels of a beggar.
Where is Polonius?
In heaven.
Send a messager there if you want to be sure.
If your messenger can’t find him, you can check hell yourself.
But seriously, if you don’t find him within the next month, you’ll be sure to smell him as you go upstairs into the main hall.
No need to hurry, he’s not going anywhere.
Hamlet, I care for you just as much as I grieve for Polonius.
For your own protection, I must send you to England at once.
So get ready to leave.
The ship is set to sail, the wind is favorable, your servants are waiting for you—everything is ready for you to go to England.
To England?
Yes, Hamlet.
Good.
Yes, you’d think so, if you knew why I was sending you.
I know an angel who can read your mind.
But okay, off to England!
Good-bye, dear mother.
I’m your father, Hamlet—your father who loves you.
You’re my mother.
When you married my mother, the two of you became one flesh, so if you’re my father you’re also my mother.
Come on, off to England!
Follow him on foot, and get him on board as quickly as possible.
Don’t waste any time.
I want him out of here tonight.
Go now; everything else is ready.
Please hurry.
And you, dear king of England, if you care about me at all—and you should, since you can still feel the damage that Denmark has done to you in the past and, so, fear and respect us—then you won’t ignore my letters instructing you to kill Hamlet immediately.
Do it,
English king, since he’s raging like a fever in my brain, and you must cure me.
Until I know it’s been done, I’ll never be happy, no matter how much luck I have.
Go, Captain, and give the Danish king my greetings.
Tell him that Fortinbras asks permission to move his troops across Denmark.
You know the meeting place we’ve arranged.
If His Majesty wants us to do any favor for him, tell him his wish is my command.
I’ll tell him, my lord.
Go ahead, then.
Sir, whose troops are these?
The king of Norway’s, sir.
What are they doing here, sir?
They’re on their way to invade some part of Poland.
Who’s commanding them, sir?
The nephew of the old king of Norway, Fortinbras.
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier?
Do you have your father’s permission?
What does Polonius say?
My son has worn me down by asking me so many times.
In the end I grudgingly consented.
I beg you, let him go.
In that case, leave when you like, Laertes, and spend your time however you wish.
I hereby grant your request, and hope you have a good time.
And now, Hamlet, my nephew and my son—   Why are you still so gloomy, with a cloud hanging over you?
It’s not true, sir.
Your son is out in the sun.
My dear Hamlet, stop wearing these black clothes, and be friendly to the king.
You can’t spend your whole life with your eyes to the ground remembering your noble father.
It happens all the time, what lives must die eventually, passing to eternity.
Yes, mother, it happens all the time.
So why does it seem so particular to you?
To tell the truth, we’re fighting to win a little patch of ground that’s not worth anything.
I myself wouldn’t pay five ducats for it, if someone offered it to me to farm.
And it won’t provide any more profits than that to either the Norwegian or the Pole.
So then the Poles won’t be willing to defend it.
Oh, yes they will.
They’ve already stationed troops there.
Good-bye, sir.
Will you please come now, my lord?
I’ll be there in a minute.
Start without me.
My God!
Everything I see shows me how wrong I am and tells me to hurry up and get on with my revenge.
What is a human being if he just eats and sleeps?
Nothing more than a beast.
God didn’t create us with such a huge power of thought and a divine capacity for reason in order for us not to use them.
Now, whether it’s animal-like mindlessness, or the cowardly hesitation
that comes from thinking too much (thinking thoughts that are one part wisdom, three parts cowardice), I don’t know why I’m still alive to say “I have to do this deed” rather than having done it already.
I have the motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it.
It’s as plain as the ground beneath my feet that I must do it.
Look at this massive army led by a delicate and tender prince who’s so puffed up with divine ambition that he puts his fragile life at risk, exposing it to danger and death, for a reason as thin as an eggshell.
To be truly great doesn’t mean you’d only fight for a good reason.
It means you’d fight over nothing if your honor was at stake.
So where does that leave me, whose father has been murdered and mother defiled, ignoring these mental and emotional provocations and letting well enough alone?
Meanwhile, to my shame, I watch twenty thousand men go marching to their deaths for an illusion and a little bit of fame, fighting for a tiny piece of land not even big enough to bury them all.
From now on, if my thoughts aren’t violent I’ll consider them worthless.
I won’t speak to her.
She’s insistent.
In fact, she’s crazed.
You can’t help feeling sorry for her.
What does she want?
She talks about her father a lot, and says she hears there are conspiracies around the world, and coughs, and beats her breast, and gets angry over tiny matters, and talks nonsense.
Her words don’t mean anything, but her babbling causes her listeners to draw conclusions.
They hear what they want to hear.
Her winks and nods and gestures do suggest that she means to convey a message, and not a happy one.
It’s a good idea to speak to her, since she might lead those with evil intentions to dangerous conclusions.
Show her in.  
Where is the beautiful queen of Denmark?
What are you doing, Ophelia?
Oh heavens, what does that song mean, my dear?
I’m sorry, did you say something?
Please just listen.
Oh, ho!
No, Ophelia— Just listen, please.
My lord, look at this poor girl.

How are you doing, my pretty lady?
I’m quite well, and may God give you what you deserve.
They say the baker’s daughter was turned into an owl for refusing Jesus' bread.
My lord, we know what we are now, but not what we may become.
May God be at your table.
She’s talking about her dead father.
Oh, let’s not talk about that, but when they ask you what it means, just say:                       Pretty Ophelia— Hang on, I’ll end it soon, I promise:                        
How long has she been like this?
I hope everything will turn out fine.
We must be patient, but I can’t help crying when I think of him being laid in the cold ground.
My brother will hear about this.
And so I thank you for your good advice.
Come, driver!
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.
Follow her.
Keep an eye on her, please.
Oh, her grief has poisoned her mind.
Her father died and now look at her!
Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude, when bad things happen, they don’t come one at a time, like enemy spies, but all at once like an army.
First her father was killed, then your son was taken away—because of his own violent actions.
The people are confused and spreading nasty rumors about Polonius’s death, and I was a fool to bury him in a hurry, without a proper state funeral.
Poor Ophelia has been robbed of her sanity, without which we’re just pictures, or animals.
Last but not least, her brother has secretly returned from France and is surrounded by gossip-mongers, who fill his ears with wicked stories about his father’s death.
Deprived of proper evidence, he’ll naturally attribute the murder to me.
Oh, dear Gertrude, I feel as though I’m being murdered many times over.
Oh, no—what’s that noise?
Listen!
Where are my bodyguards?
Let them guard the door.
What is it?
You must save yourself, my lord.
The young Laertes, like the ocean when it floods the shore and devours the lowlands, is leading a rebellion against your government.
The crowd calls him “lord” and shouts, “We want Laertes to be king!” It’s as if they were starting the world from scratch right now, throwing out the traditions and ancient customs that are the support of every word we utter.
They throw their caps in the air and yell, “Laertes will be king!
Laertes king!” They sound so cheerful as they hunt down the wrong prey!
Oh, you’re on the wrong track, you disloyal Danish dogs!
The doors have been smashed open.
Where’s this so-called king?
Men, wait outside.
No, let us in!
Please wait.
All right, we will, we will.
Thank you.
Guard the door.
Calm down, good Laertes.
I’ve got exactly one calm drop of blood in my body, and it proclaims that  Laertes, what makes you so rebellious?
Let him go, Gertrude.
Don’t worry about my getting hurt.
God protects the king, so traitors can’t hurt him.—Tell me, Laertes, why you’re so angry.—Gertrude, let him go.—Tell me, man.
Where’s my father?
He’s dead.
But the king didn’t kill him.
Let him ask what he wants to ask.
How did he end up dead?
Don’t mess with me.
To hell with my vows of allegiance to you!
Vows can go to hell!
Conscience, too!
I don’t care if I’m damned.
I don’t care what happens to me in this world or the next.
Whatever happens, happens, but I’ll get revenge for my father’s murder.
Who’s stopping you?
Only my free will—nothing else.
What little means I have, I’ll use against you.
My dear Laertes, in your eagerness to know the truth about your father’s death, are you determined to hurt your father’s friends and enemies alike?
No, only his enemies.
Do you want to know who they are, then?
I’ll open my arms wide to his true friends, and like a mother  Why, now you’re talking like a good son and a true gentleman.
I’ll prove to you as clearly as daylight that I’m innocent of your father’s death, and am struck with grief over it.
What’s that noise?
Oh, heat, dry up my brains!
Salty tears, burn my eyes!
By heaven, I’ll get revenge for your madness!
Oh, you springtime rose, dear maiden, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
Is it possible that a young woman’s mind could fade away as easily as an old man’s life?
Human nature is refined and thoughtful—person graciously gives a valuable part of herself away to her beloved, as Ophelia has sent off her sanity to her dead father.
Good-bye, honey.
If you were sane and could urge me to take revenge, you couldn’t be more persuasive than you are now.
You’re supposed to sing, “A down a-down,” and you, “Call him a-down-a.” Oh, how it turns around like a wheel!
Like the worker who stole his boss’s daughter.
This nonsense means more than rational speech.
Look at my flowers.
There’s rosemary, that’s for remembering.
Please remember, love.
And there are pansies, they’re for thoughts.
Seem,” mother?
No, it  Hamlet, you are so sweet and such a good son to mourn your father like this.
But you have to remember, that your father lost his father, who lost his father before him, and every time, each son has had to mourn his father for a certain period.
But overdoing it is just stubborn.
It’s not manly.
It’s not what God wants, and it betrays a vulnerable heart and an ignorant and weak mind.
Since we know that everyone must die sooner or later, why should we take it to heart?
You’re committing a crime against heaven, against the dead, and against nature.
And it’s irration-al, since the truth is that all fathers must die.
Please give up this useless mourning of yours and start thinking of me as your new father.
A case study in madness, to connect memory and thought.
Sadness and torment, suffering, hell itself—she makes them almost pretty.
And on the souls of all good Christians, I hope.
Goodbye, God be with you.
Do you see this, oh, God?
Laertes, I have a right to share your grief.
Go choose your wisest friends, and have them listen to both of us and decide which of us is right.
If directly or indirectly they find me implicated in your father’s murder, I’ll give up my kingdom, my crown, my life, and everything I call my own to you as restitution.
But if they find me innocent, then be patient and I’ll work to satisfy to the fullest extent your deepest need for revenge.
All right, then.
The way he died, his secret funeral, no funeral rites or military display, no noble rites or formal ceremony—shout out from heaven and earth that I must call the way he died into question.
And you’re right to do so.
May the guilty party be punished by death.
Please, come with me.
Who are the people who want to speak with me?
Sailors, sir.
They say they have letters for you.
Show them in.
I don’t know who else would send me a letter from abroad except Hamlet.
Hello, sir.
God bless you.
May He bless you, too.
He will, sir, if He wants to.
There’s a letter for you, sir.
It’s from the ambassador, Lord Hamlet, who was going to England—if your name’s Horatio, as they told me it is.
Horatio,  When you’ve read this letter, find a way to let these guys see the king.
They have letters for him.
Before we were at sea for even two days, a pirate ship equipped for battle pursued us.
We were too slow to escape, so we were forced to stand and fight.
In the battle that followed I ended up on the pirate ship.
Just then they left our ship behind, so I became the only prisoner on board.
They’ve treated me quite mercifully for thieves, but they knew what they were doing.
They want me to do a favor for them.
Give the king the letters I’ve sent, and come to me as fast as you would run from death.
I’ve got things to tell you that will make you speechless, and they aren’t even half the story.
These guys will take you to me.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are on their way to England.
I have a lot to tell you about them.
Good-bye.
Your trusted friend,      Hamlet.” Come, men.
I’ll show you where to deliver these letters as quickly as possible, so that you can take me to the man who sent them.
Now you’ve got to acknowledge my innocence and believe I’m your friend, since you’ve heard and understood that the man who killed your father was trying to kill me.
It looks that way.
But tell me why you didn’t take immediate action against his criminal acts, when your own safety and everything else would seem to call for it.
Oh, for two main reasons which may seem weak to you, but strong to me.
The queen, his mother, is devoted to him.
And (for better or worse, whichever it is) she is such a part of my life and soul that I can’t live apart from her, any more than a planet can leave its orbit.
The other reason why I couldn’t prosecute and arrest Hamlet is that the public loves him.
In their affection they overlook all his faults.
Like magic, they convert them into virtues, so whatever I said against him would end up hurting me, not him.
And so I’ve lost my noble father, had my sister driven insane—my sister who once was (if I can praise her for what she once was, not what she is now) the most perfect girl who ever lived.
But I’ll get my revenge.
Don’t you worry about that.
You must not think that I’m so lazy and dull that I can be severely threatened and think it’s just a game.
You’ll hear more about my plans soon enough.
I loved your father, and I love myself, which should be enough to— What is it?
What’s the news?
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.
This one’s for Your Highness, this one for the queen.
From Hamlet?
Who delivered them?
Sailors, my lord, or so they say.
I didn’t see them.
Claudio gave them to me, and he got them from the one who delivered them.
Laertes, I want you to hear what they say.
Leave us alone now.
High and Mighty one,  You know I’ve been set down naked, you might say, in your kingdom.
Tomorrow I’ll beg permission to look into your kingly eyes, at which point I’ll tell you the story (after first apologizing) of how I came back to Denmark so strangely and suddenly.
Hamlet”
What does this mean?
Has everyone else come back too?
Or is it all a lie—and no one has yet returned?
Do you recognize the handwriting?
It’s Hamlet’s writing.
Naked,” he says.
And in a P.S.
he adds, “alone.” Can you help me out with this?
I have no clue, my lord.
But let him come.
It warms my weary heart to think I’ll get the chance to look him in the eye and say, “You did this.” If that’s how you feel, Laertes—and why shouldn’t you?
Will you let me guide and direct you?
Yes, my lord, as long as you won’t lead me toward peace.
No, just toward your own peace of mind.
If he’s come back to Denmark without plans to continue on his trip, then I’ll trick him into an undertaking, which I’m working out now, that’s sure to kill him.
When he dies, no one will be blamed, even his mother will call it an accident.
My lord, I’ll let you make the decision.
I only ask to be in on your plans, the agent of his death.
That’ll be fine.
Since you left, people have been talking about—and within earshot of Hamlet—a certain quality of yours in which, they say, you shine.
All your talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did, though to me it’s far from your best attribute.
What quality is that, my lord?
A trivial little ribbon on the cap of youth—yet an important one, too, since casual clothes suit young people as much as serious business suits and overcoats suit the middle-aged.
Two months ago I met a gentleman from Normandy.
I’ve fought against the French and have seen how well they ride, but this man was a magician on horseback.
It was as if he were part of the horse, so skillful that even having seen him, I can hardly conceive of the tricks he did.
Hmm, he was from Normandy, you say?
Yes, from Normandy.
I bet it was Lamond.
Yes, that’s the one.
I know him well.
He’s his homeland’s jewel.
He mentioned you to me, giving you such high marks in fencing that he exclaimed it would be a miracle if someone could match you.
French fencers wouldn’t be good enough for you, he said, since they don’t have the right moves or skills.
Hamlet was so jealous when he heard Lamond’s report that he talked about nothing else but having you come over and play against him.
Now, the point is … What’s the point, my lord?
Laertes, did you love your father?
Or is your grief just an illusion—a mere painting of sorrow?
How could you ask?
Not that I suspect you didn’t love your father, but I’ve seen it happen that, as the days go by, time dampens the flame of love.
The fire of love always burns itself out, and nothing stays the way it began.
Even a good thing can grow too big and die from its own excess.
We should do what we intend to do right when we intend it, since our intentions are subject to as many weakenings and delays as there are words in the dictionary and accidents in life.
And then all our “woulds” and “shoulds” are nothing but hot air.
But back to my point: Hamlet’s coming back.
What proof will you offer—in action, not just words—that you’re your father’s son?
I’ll cut Hamlet’s throat in church.
It’s true, no place—not even a church—should offer refuge to that murderer.
Revenge should have no limits.
But Laertes, will you do this: stay in your room?
When Hamlet comes home he’ll learn you’re here.
I’ll have people praise your excellence and put a double coat on the fame the Frenchman gave you.
In short, we’ll get you together and place bets on you.
Hamlet’s so careless, high-minded, and unsuspecting that he won’t examine the swords beforehand, so you can easily choose one with a sharpened point and in one thrust avenge the death of your father.
I’ll do it, and I’ll put a little dab of something on my sword as well.
From a quack doctor I bought some oil so poisonous that if you dip a knife in it, no medicine in the world can save the person who’s scratched by it.
If I even graze his skin slightly, he’s likely to die.
Let’s think about this, and consider what time and what method will be most appropriate.
If our plan were to fail, and people found out about it, it would be better never to have tried it.
We should have a backup ready in case the first plan doesn’t work.
Let me think.
We’ll place bets on you and Hamlet—that’s it!
When the two of you have gotten all sweaty and hot—keep him jumping around a lot for that purpose—Hamlet will ask for something to drink.
I’ll have a cup ready for him.
If by chance he
Because everyone knows that you are the man closest to this throne, and I love you just as much as any father loves his son.
And your plans for going back to Wittenberg are not what I want.
I’m asking you now to stay here in my company as the number-one member of my court, my nephew and now my son too.
Please answer my prayers, Hamlet, and stay with us.
Don’t go back to Wittenberg.
I’ll obey you as well as I can, ma'am.
That’s the right answer—it shows your love.
Stay in Denmark like us.—My dear wife, come.
Hamlet’s agreeing to stay makes me happy, and every merry toast I’ll drink today will be heard as far as the clouds overhead.
My drinking will be echoed in the heavens.
Let’s go.
Ah, I wish my dirty flesh could melt away into a vapor, or that God had not made a law against suicide.
Oh God, God!
How tired, stale, and pointless life is to me.
Damn it!
It’s like a garden that no one’s taking care of, and that’s growing wild.
Only nasty weeds grow in it now.
I can’t believe it’s come to this.
My father’s only been dead for two months—no, not even two.
Such an excellent king, as superior to my uncle as a god is to a beast, and so loving toward my mother that he kept the wind from blowing too hard on her face.
escapes your poisoned sword tip, the drink will kill him.
But wait, what’s that sound?
The bad news just keeps on coming, one disaster after another.
Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.
Drowned?
Oh, where?
There’s a willow that leans over the brook, dangling its white leaves over the glassy water.
Ophelia made wild wreaths out of those leaves, braiding in crowflowers, thistles, daisies, and the orchises that vulgar shepherds have an obscene name for, but which pure-minded girls call “dead men’s fingers.” Climbing into the tree to hang the wreath of weeds on the hanging branches, she and her flowers fell into the gurgling brook.
Her clothes spread out wide in the water, and buoyed her up for a while as she sang bits of old hymns, acting like someone who doesn’t realize the danger she’s in, or like someone completely accustomed to danger.
But it was only a matter of time before her clothes, heavy with the water they absorbed, pulled the poor thing out of her song, down into the mud at the bottom of the brook.
So she is drowned.
Drowned, drowned.
You’ve had too much water already, poor Ophelia, so I won’t shed watery tears for you.
But crying is what humans do.
We do what’s in our nature, even if we’re ashamed of it.
After I stop crying I’ll be through acting like a woman.
Good-bye, my lord.
I have some fiery words I could speak now, but my foolish tears are drowning them out.
Let’s follow him, Gertrude.
I worked so hard to calm him down, and now I’m worried he’s getting all excited again.
Let’s follow him.
Are they really going to give her a Christian burial  I’m telling you, yes.
So finish that grave right away.
The coroner examined her case and says it should be a Christian funeral.
But how, unless she drowned in self-defense?
That’s what they’re saying she did.
Sounds more like “self-offense,” if you ask me.
What I’m saying is, if she knew she was drowning herself, then that’s an act.
An act has three sides to it: to do, to act, and to perform.
Therefore she must have known she was drowning herself.
No, listen here, gravedigger sir— Let me finish.
Here’s the water, right?
And here’s a man, okay?
If the man goes into the water and drowns himself, he’s the one doing it, like it or not.
But if the water comes to him and drowns him, then he doesn’t drown himself.
Therefore, he who is innocent of his own death does not shorten his own life.
Is that how the law sees it?
It sure is.
The coroner’s inquest law.
Do you want to know the truth?
If this woman hadn’t been rich, she wouldn’t have been given a Christian burial.
Well there, now you’ve said it.
It’s a pity that the rich have more freedom to hang or drown themselves than the rest of us Christians.
Come on, shovel.
The most ancient aristocrats in the world are gardeners, ditch-diggers, and gravediggers.
They keep up Adam’s profession.
Was he an aristocrat?
With a coat of arms?
He was the first person who ever had arms.
He didn’t have any.
What, aren’t you a Christian?
The Bible says Adam dug in the ground.
How could he dig without arms?
I’ll ask you another question.
If you can’t answer it— Go ahead!
What do you call a person who builds stronger things than a stonemason, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter does?
The one who builds the gallows to hang people on, since his structure outlives a thousand inhabitants.
You’re funny, and I like that.
The gallows do a good job.
But how?
It does a good job for those who do bad.
Now, it’s wrong to say that the gallows are stronger than a church.
Therefore, the gallows may do  Let’s see, “Who builds stronger things than a stonemason, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter?” That’s the question, so answer it.
Ah, I’ve got it!
Go ahead.
Damn, I forgot.
Don’t beat your brains out over it.
You can’t make a slow donkey run by beating it.
The next time someone asks you this riddle, say “a gravedigger.” The houses he makes last till Judgment Day.
Now go and get me some booze.
Doesn’t this guy realize what he’s doing?
He’s singing while digging a grave.
He’s gotten so used to graves that they don’t bother him anymore.
Yes, exactly.
Only people who don’t have to work can afford to be sensitive.
That skull had a tongue in it once and could sing.
That jackass is throwing it around as if it belonged to Cain, who did the first murder!
It might be the skull of a politician once capable of talking his way around God, right?
And now this idiot is pulling rank on him.
Indeed, my lord.
Or a courtier, who could say things like, “Good night, my sweet lord!
How are you doing, good lord?” This might be the skull of Lord So-and-So, who praised Lord Such-and-Such’s horse when he wanted to borrow it, right?
Yes, my lord.
Exactly.
And now it’s the property of Lady Worm, its lower jaw knocked off and thwacked on the noggin with a shovel.
That’s quite a reversal of fortune, isn’t it, if we could only see it?
Are these bones worth nothing more than bowling pins now?
It makes my bones ache to think about it.
There’s another.
Could that be a lawyer’s skull?
Where’s all his razzle-dazzle legal jargon now?
Why does he allow this idiot to knock him on the head with a dirty shovel, instead of suing him for assault and battery?
Maybe this guy was once a great landowner, with his deeds and contracts, his tax shelters and his annuities.
Is it part of his deed of ownership to have his skull filled up with dirt?
Does he only get to keep as much land as a set of contracts would cover if you spread them out on the ground?
The deeds to his properties would barely fit in this coffin—and the coffin’s all the property he gets to keep?
No more than that, my lord.
Isn’t the parchment of a legal document made of sheepskin?
Yes, my lord, and calfskin too.
Anyone who puts his trust in such documents is a sheep or a calf.
I’ll talk to this guy.—Excuse me, sir, whose grave is this?
It’s mine, sir.
I think it really must be yours, since you’re the one lying in it.
And you’re lying outside of it, so it’s not yours.
As for me, I’m not lying to you in it—it’s really mine.
But you  That’s a lively lie, sir—it jumps so fast from me to you.
What man are you digging it for?
For no man, sir.
What woman, then?
For no woman, either.
Who’s to be buried in it?
One who used to be a woman but—bless her soul—is dead now.
How literal this guy is!
We have to speak precisely, or he’ll get the better of us with his wordplay.
Lord, Horatio, I’ve been noticing this for a few years now.
The peasants have become so clever and witty that they’re nipping at the heels of noblemen.—How long have you been a gravedigger?
Of all the days in the year, I started the day that the late King Hamlet defeated Fortinbras.
How long ago was that?
You don’t know that?
Any fool could tell you, it was the day that young Hamlet was born—the one who went crazy and got sent off to England.
Why was he sent to England?
Because he was crazy.
He’ll recover his sanity there.
Or if he doesn’t, it won’t matter in England.
Why not?
Because nobody will notice he’s crazy.
Everyone there is as crazy as he is.
How did he go crazy?
In a strange way, they say.
What do you mean, “in a strange way”?
By losing his mind.
On what grounds?
Right here in Denmark.
I’ve been the church warden here for thirty years, since childhood.
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot?
Well, if he’s not rotten before he dies (and there are a lot of people now who are so rotten they start falling to pieces even before you put them in the coffin), he’ll last eight or nine years.
A leathermaker will last nine years.
Why does he last longer?
Because his hide is so leathery from his trade that he keeps the water off him a long time, and water is what makes your goddamn body rot more than anything.
Here’s a skull that’s been here twenty-three years.
Whose was it?
A crazy bastard.
Who do you think?
I really don’t know.
Damn that crazy madman!
He poured a pitcher of white wine on my head once.
This is the skull of Yorick, the king’s jester.
This one?
Yes, that one.
Let me see.
Your flashes of wit that used to set the whole table laughing?
You don’t make anybody smile now.
Are you sad about that?
You need to go to my lady’s room and tell her that no matter how much makeup she slathers on, she’ll end up just like you some day.
That’ll make her laugh.
Horatio, tell me something.
Oh God, do I have to remember that?
She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him.
Yet even so, within a month of my father’s death (I don’t even want to think about it.
Oh women!
You are so weak!
even before she had broken in the shoes she wore to his funeral, crying like crazy—even an animal would have mourned its mate longer than she did!—there she was marrying my uncle, my father’s brother, who’s about as much like my father as I’m like Hercules.
Less than a month after my father’s death, even before the tears on her cheeks had dried, she remarried.
Oh, so quick to jump into a bed of incest!
That’s not good, and no good can come of it either.
But my heart must break in silence, since I can’t mention my feelings aloud.
Hello, sir.
Nice to see you again, Horatio—that is your name, right?
That’s me, sir.
Still your respectful servant.
Not my servant, but my friend.
I’ll change that name for you.
But what are you doing so far from Wittenberg, Horatio?
Oh, Marcellus?
Hello, sir.
What’s that, my lord?
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried?
Exactly like that.
And smelled like that, too?
Whew!
Just as bad, my lord.
How low we can fall, Horatio.
Isn’t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel?
If you thought that you’d be thinking too much.
No, not at all.
Just follow the logic: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returned to dust, the dust is dirt, and dirt makes mud we use to stop up holes.
So why can’t someone plug a beer barrel with the dirt that used to be Alexander?
The great emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might plug up a hole to keep the wind away.
Oh, to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall!
But quiet, be quiet a minute.
Here comes the king, the queen, and the noblemen of court.
Who are they following?
And with such a plain and scrawny ceremony?
It means the corpse they’re following took its own life.
Must have been from a wealthy family.
Let’s stay and watch a while.
What other rites are you going to give her?
That’s Laertes, a very noble young man.
Listen.
What other rites are you going to give her?
I’ve performed as many rites as I’m permitted.
Her death was suspicious, and were it not for the fact that the king gave orders to bury her here, she’d have been buried outside the church graveyard.
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body.
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin, with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her.
Isn’t there any other rite you can perform?
No, nothing.
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them.
Lay her in the ground, and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh!
I’m telling you, you jerk priest, my sister will be an angel in heaven while you’re howling in hell.  
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl.
Goodbye!
Oh, damn three times, damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind.
Hold off burying her until I’ve caught her in my arms once more.
Now pile the dirt onto the living and the dead alike, till you’ve made a mountain higher than   To hell with your soul!
That’s no way to pray.
Pull them apart.
Hamlet!
Hamlet!
Gentlemen!
I’ll fight him over this issue till I don’t have the strength to blink.
Oh, my son, what issue is that?
I loved Ophelia.
Forty thousand brothers, if you added all their love together, couldn’t match mine.
What are you going to do for her?
Oh, he’s crazy, Laertes!
For the love of God, be patient with him.
Damn it, show me what you’re going to do for her.
Will you cry?
Fight?
Stop eating?
Cut yourself?
Drink vinegar?
Eat a crocodile?
I’ll do all that.
Did you come here to whine?
To outdo me by jumping into her grave so theatrically?
To be buried alive with her?
So will I.
And if you rattle on about mountains, then let them throw millions of acres over us.
It will be so high a peak that it scrapes against heaven and makes Mount Ossa look like a wart.
See?
I can talk crazy as well as you.
This is pure insanity.
He’ll be like this for a little while.
Then he’ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch.
Listen, sir, why do you treat me like this?
I always loved you.
But it doesn’t matter.
Even a hero like Hercules can’t keep cats from acting like cats, and dogs like dogs.
Please, Horatio, go with him.  
Who’s there?
No, who are  Long live the king!
Is that Barnardo?
Yes, it’s me.
You’ve come right on time.
The clock’s just striking twelve.
Go home to bed, Francisco.
Thanks for letting me go.
It’s bitterly cold out, and I’m depressed.
Has it been a quiet night?
I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak.
Well, good night.
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus, who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight, tell them to hurry.
I think I hear them.
Stop!
Who’s there?
That’s enough about that.
Now I’ll tell you the other story about my journey.
Do you remember the circumstances?
How could I forget, my lord!
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep.
It was worse than being a captive in chains.
Sometimes it’s good to be rash—sometimes it works out well to act impulsively when our careful plans lose steam.
This should show us that there’s a God in heaven who’s always guiding us in the right direction, however often we screw up— Well, of course.
So I came up from my cabin with my robe tied around me, groped in the dark to find what I was looking for, found it, looked through their packet of papers, and returned to my cabin again.
I was bold enough (I guess my fears made me forget my manners) to open the document containing the king’s instructions.
And there I found, Horatio, such royal mischief—a precisely worded order, sugared with lots of talk about Denmark’s well-being and England’s too, to cut off my head, without even waiting to sharpen the ax.
Is it possible?
Yes, please tell me.
So there I was, caught in their evil net.
Before I could even start processing the situation, they had started the ball rolling.
I sat down and wrote out a new official document with new instructions.
I wrote it in a bureaucrat’s neat handwriting.
I used to think having nice handwriting was for servants, just like our politicians think, and I had to work hard to overcome that prejudice—but it sure came in handy then.
Do you want to know what I wrote?
Yes, my lord.
A sincere plea from the king, who commands the respect of England, and who hopes that the love between the two countries can flourish, and that peace can join them in friendship—and other fancy mumbo jumbo like that—saying that, once they read this document, without any debate, the ones delivering the letter should be put to death immediately, without giving them time to confess to a priest.
But how could you put an official seal on it?
Heaven helped me out with that too.
I had my father’s signet ring in my pocket, with the royal seal of Denmark on it.
I folded up the new document, signed it, sealed it, and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference.
The next day we had our fight at sea, and you know what happened after that.
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it.
Man, they were asking for it.
I don’t feel guilty about them at all.
They got what they deserved.
It’s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents.
What a king Claudius is!
Don’t you think it’s my duty now to kill him with this weapon?
This man who killed my king, made my mother a whore, took the throne that I hoped for, and set a trap to kill me.
Isn’t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword—and an easy conscience?
And wouldn’t I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm?
He’ll find out soon what happened in England.
Soon enough.
But I have the meantime.
A human life is hardly long enough to count to one in.
But I really feel bad, Horatio, about losing control of myself with Laertes.
His situation is very much like my own.
I’ll be nice to him.
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury.
Hang on a minute—who are you?
Welcome back to Denmark, my lord.
Thank you kindly, sir.
My lord, if you have a free moment, I have a message from His Majesty.
I’ll hang on every word you say.
Put your hat back on, where it belongs: it’s for your head, not for your hands to hold.
No thank you, my lord.
It’s very hot.
No, I’m telling you, it’s very cold, with a northerly wind.
It is rather cold, indeed, my lord.
And yet I feel it’s very hot and humid, which is bad for my complexion.
Yes indeed it is, sir.
Very humid, I can’t tell you how humid it is.
My lord, His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he’s placed a large bet on you.
This is what it’s all about— Please, I beg you— No, my lord, I’m comfortable like this, thank you.
Sir, there’s someone named Laertes who’s recently come to the court.
He’s an absolute gentleman, totally outstanding in so many respects, very easy in society, and displaying all his excellent qualities.
Sir, your description of him doesn’t detract from his good qualities, though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin, and even so you wouldn’t be able to keep up with him.
I felt like skipping school, sir.
I wouldn’t allow your enemies to say that, and I won’t believe it from you.
I know you’d never skip school.
What are you doing here in Elsinore?
I’ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave.
Sir, we came to see your father’s funeral.
Please, don’t make fun of me.
I think you came to see my mother’s wedding instead.
Well, sir, it’s true it came soon after.
It was all about saving a few bucks, Horatio.
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet.
Oh, I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven, Horatio, than have lived through that terrible day!
My father—I think I see my father.
Where, sir?
In my imagination, Horatio.
I saw him once.
He was an admirable king.
He was a great human being.
He was perfect in everything.
I’ll never see the likes of him again.
Speaking the very truth of high praise, I can honestly say that I find him to possess a soul of such great importance, and so rare and unique in every respect, that—to speak the absolute truth—he can find an equal only when he gazes into a mirror.
Anyone else is just a pale copy of him.
You speak absolutely correctly, sir.
And what’s the point, sir?
Why are we talking about him like this?
Sorry, sir?
Laertes, you mean?
Yes, Laertes, sir.
I know you know something— Thanks for the compliment, I’m happy you know that.
But in fact it doesn’t say much.
I’m sorry, you were saying?
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is—
I can’t admit that, since you’d have to compare his excellence to mine.
But knowing a person well is a bit like knowing oneself.
Excellent in fencing, I mean, sir.
His reputation in fencing is unrivaled.
What kind of weapon does he use?
The rapier and the dagger.
Those are only two of his weapons.
But, go on.
The king has bet six Barbary horses, and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories.
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed, and they match the fencing accessories.
What do you mean by “carriages”?
The carriages, sir, are the hangers—where the swords hang.
Carriage” makes it sound like it’s pulling around a cannon.
I prefer to call it a “hanger.” But anyway.
Six Barbary horses, six French swords with accessories, and three imaginatively designed carriages—sounds like a French bet against the Danish.
Why has all this been put on the table?
The king, sir, has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes, he won’t beat you by more than three hits.
You could get started immediately if you’ll give me your answer.
But what if my answer’s no?
I mean, if you’d agree to play against Laertes, sir.
Sir, I’m going to go for a walk in the hall here whether the king likes it or not.
It’s my exercise time.
Bring in the swords, if the king still wants to go through with it and if Laertes is still willing.
I’ll have the king win his bet if I can.
If not, I’ll only have suffered some embarrassment and a few sword hits.
Shall I quote you in those exact words, sir?
Just get the point across, however flowery you want to be.
My services are at your command.
Thank you.
It’s a good thing he’s here to recommend himself.
No one else would.
That crazy bird’s only half-hatched.
He used to praise his mother’s nipple before he sucked it.
He’s like so many successful people in these trashy times—he’s patched together enough fancy phrases and trendy opinions to carry him along.
But blow a little on this bubbly talk, and it’ll burst.
There’s no substance here.
My lord, Osric has told the king about your agreeing to the fencing match.
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away, or wait awhile.
I’ll do whatever the king wants.
If he’s ready now, so am I.
Otherwise, I’ll do it anytime, as long as I’m able.
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else.
Right on cue.
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes—politely—before you begin your match.
She’s full of good advice.
You’re going to lose this bet, my lord.
I don’t think so.
I’ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France.
With the handicap they’ve given me, I think I’ll win.
But I have a sinking feeling anyway.
Oh well.
Wait, my lord— I know I’m being foolish, but I have the kind of vague misgiving women often get.
If something is telling you not to play, listen to it.
I’ll say you’re not feeling well.
You’ll do no such thing.
I thumb my nose at superstitions.
God controls everything—even something as trivial as a sparrow’s death.
Everything will work out as it is destined.
If something is supposed to happen now, it will.
If it’s supposed to happen later, it won’t happen now.
What’s important is to be prepared.
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind, then what does it mean to leave early?
Let it be.
Come shake hands with Laertes, Hamlet.
CLAUDIUS   
And if that’s true, then Hamlet is the victim of his own illness—his illness is his enemy.
Sir, with this audience as witness, let me declare that I’m as innocent of premeditated evil against you as I would be if I had happened to shoot an arrow over my house and accidentally hit my brother.
My feelings are satisfied—even though what you have done to my father and sister should drive me to revenge.
Yet when it comes to my honor, I can’t forgive you so fast.
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so.
Until then I will accept your love as love.
I’m grateful for your love.
Come on, give us the swords, and we will play this friendly fencing match enthusiastically.
Yes, hand me one too.
I’m going to make you look sharp, Laertes.
I’m so bad at the game that your skill will shine like the brightest star in the darkest night.
You’re making fun of me.
No, I swear I’m not.
Give them the swords, Osric.
Hamlet, you know the bet?
Yes, my lord, quite well.
You’ve bet on the weaker fencer.
I’m not worried.
I’ve seen both of you fence.
But since Laertes is better, we’ve given him a handicap.
He’s got to outdo you by three hits to win.
This sword’s too heavy.
Show me another one.
I like this one.
Are they all the same length?
Yes, my lord.
Put the goblets of wine on that table.
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit, or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit, then let my soldiers give him a military salute.
I’ll drink to Hamlet’s health, and into his goblet I’ll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings.
Give me the goblets.
And now let the drum and the trumpet play, and the trumpet signal the cannon outside to fire, and let the cannon tell the heavens, and the heavens tell all the earth that the king is drinking now to Hamlet’s health.
Come on, let’s begin.
Judges, pay close attention.
Come on, sir.
Come on, my lord.
That was one hit.
No, it wasn’t.
Referee!
It was obviously a hit.
Well, let’s go on.
Give me a goblet.—Hamlet, this pearl’s yours.
Here’s to your health.
Give him the goblet.
Let me just finish this round.
Set it down awhile.
Let’s play.
Another hit.
What do you say?
You got me, I admit it.
My son will win.
He’s flabby and out of breath.—Here, Hamlet, take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead.
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness, Hamlet. 
Thank you, madam.
Gertrude, don’t drink that.
Excuse me.
I’ll drink it if I like.
I’d better not drink now.
I’ll drink later.
Come on, let me wipe your face.
I doubt it.
Get ready for the third hit, Laertes.
You’re just playing around.
Come on, give me your best shot.
I sense you’re treating me like a child.
You think so?
Come on.
They’re neck and neck.
Take this!
Separate them.
They’re overdoing it.
No, come on, one more time.
Take care of the queen!
Both fencers are bleeding—how do you feel, my lord?
How do you feel, Laertes?
Like a mouse caught in my own trap, Osric.
How’s the queen?
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding.
No, no, the drink, the drink!
Oh, my dear Hamlet!
The drink, the drink!
I’ve been poisoned.
Oh, what evil!
Lock the door.
We’ve been betrayed!
Find out who did it!
I’m the one, Hamlet.
Hamlet, you’re dead.
No medicine in the world can cure you.
You don’t have more than half an hour to live.
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand, sharp and dipped in poison.
The foul plan backfired on me.
Here I lie and will never get up again.
Your mother’s been poisoned.
I can’t speak anymore.
The king, the king’s to blame.
The blade poisoned!
Then get to work, poison!
Sir, I think I saw him last night.
Saw who?
Your father, sir.
The dead king.
The king my father?!
Don’t get too excited yet, sir.
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw, with these gentlemen as witnesses.
For God’s sake, let me hear it.
After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards, Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your father, in full armor from head to toe.
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times, a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes, while they turned, quaking with fear and too shocked to speak.
They told me all about this, so on the third night I agreed to come stand guard with them, to see for myself.
It happened again, just as they had described.
I knew your father.
This ghost looked as much like him as my two hands are like each other.
But where did this happen?
Treason!
Treason!
Protect me, my friends.
I’ve only been hurt, not killed.
Here, you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer, drink this.
Is your little pearl in there?
Follow my mother.
He got what he deserved.
He mixed that poison himself.
Please forgive me as I forgive you, Hamlet.
You’re not responsible for my death and my father’s, and I’m not responsible for yours.
God will free you from blame.
I’ll follow you to heaven in a minute.—I’m dying, Horatio.—Goodbye, miserable queen.—And all you people watching, pale and trembling, speechless spectators of these acts, I could tell you a thing or two if I had the time (though this cruel officer, Death, doesn’t allow much free time).
Let it be.—Horatio, I’m dying.
You’re alive.
Tell everyone what happened; set the story straight.
Not for a second.
I’m more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane.
Some of this liquor’s still left in the goblet. 
Please, give me that goblet, if you love me.
Let go of it!
I’ll get it from you, I swear.
Oh God, Horatio, what a damaged reputation I’m leaving behind me, as no one knows the truth.
If you ever loved me, then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile, and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story.
What are these warlike noises?
Young Fortinbras, returning in triumph from Poland, is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors.
Oh, I’m dying, Horatio!
This strong poison’s overpowering me.
I will not live to hear the news from England.
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown.
He’s got my vote as I die.
So tell him that, given the recent events here—oh, the rest is silence.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Now a noble heart is breaking.
Good night, sweet prince.
May hosts of angels sing you to sleep.—Why are those drums approaching?
What do I see here?
What would you like to see?
If it’s a tragedy, you’ve come to the right place.
These corpses suggest mayhem.
Oh, proud Death, what banquet are you preparing that you’ve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke?
This is a horrible sight.
Our news arrives from England too late, since the people that should have heard it are dead.
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Who will thank us now?
Let’s hear about it right away and invite all the noblemen to listen.
As for me, I welcome my good luck with sadness.
I have some rights to claim this kingdom, and by arriving at this moment I have an opportunity to put them into effect.
I also have a few things to say about that, which Hamlet just told me.
But let’s get down to business—even though people are in a frenzy of grief—to avoid any further plots and mishaps.
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage.
He would have been a great king if he had had the chance to prove himself.
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities.
Pick up the corpses.
A sight like this suits a battlefield, but here at court it shows that much went wrong.
Go outside and tell the soldiers to fire their guns in honor of Hamlet.
On the platform where we stand guard, sir.
Didn’t you talk to it?
I did, sir, but it didn’t answer me.
It raised its head once as if it was about to speak, but just then the rooster started crowing, and the ghost vanished from sight.
That’s very strange.
I swear to God it’s true, sir.
We thought you ought to know about it.
Yes, I should know, but it disturbs me.
Are you on duty again tonight?
Yes, sir.
It was armed, you say?
Armed, sir.
From head to toe?
Yes, from top to bottom, sir.
So you couldn’t see his face, then?
Oh, yes, we could, sir.
He had his helmet visor up.
Was he frowning?
He looked more sad than angry.
Was he pale or flushed and red-faced?
Very pale, sir.
Did he stare at you?
The whole time.
I wish I’d been there.
You would have been very shocked.
I’m sure I would have.
Did it stay a long time?
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred.
No, longer than that.
Not the time I saw it.
His beard was gray, right?
It was just like in real life, dark brown with silver whiskers in it.
I’ll stand guard with you tonight.
Maybe it’ll come again.
I bet it will.
If it looks like my good father, I’ll speak to it, even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet.
I ask you, if you’ve kept this a secret, keep doing so.
Whatever happens tonight, don’t talk about it.
I’ll return the favor.
So good-bye for now.
I’ll see you on the guards' platform between eleven and twelve tonight.
We’ll do our duty to you, sir.
Give me your love instead, as I give you mine.
Good-bye.
My father’s ghost—armed!
Something’s wrong.
I suspect some foul play.
I wish the night were here already!
Until then, I have to remain calm.
Bad deeds will be revealed, no matter how people try to hide them.
My belongings are on the ship already.
Good-bye.
And, my dear sister, as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing, let me hear from you—write.
Do you doubt I’ll write?
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you, just consider it a big flirtation, the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth.
It won’t last.
It’s sweet, but his affection will fade after a minute.
Not a second more.
No more than a minute?
Try to think of it like that, anyway.
When a youth grows into a man, he doesn’t just get bigger in his body—his responsibilities grow too.
He may love you now, and may have only the best intentions, but you have to be on your guard.
Remember that he belongs to the royal family, and his intentions don’t matter that much—he’s a slave to his family obligations.
He can’t simply make personal choices for himself the way common people can, since the whole country depends on what he does.
His choice has to agree with what the nation wants.
So if he says he loves you, you should be wise enough to see that his words only mean as much as the state of Denmark allows them to mean.
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands.
Watch out, Ophelia.
Just keep your love under control, and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust.
Simply exposing your beauty to the moon at night is risky enough—you don’t have to expose yourself to him.
Even good girls sometimes get a bad reputation.
Worms ruin flowers before they blossom.
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease.
So be careful.
Fear will keep you safe.
Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others.
I’ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart.
But, my dear brother, don’t be like a bad priest who fails to practice what he preaches, showing me the steep and narrow way to heaven while you frolic on the primrose path of sin.
Don’t worry, I won’t.
I’ve been here too long.
And here comes father.
What good luck, to have him bless my leaving not once but twice.
You’re still here?
Shame on you—get on board!
The wind is filling your ship’s sail, and they’re waiting for you.
Here, I give you my blessing again.
And just try to remember a few rules of life.
Don’t say what you’re thinking, and don’t be too quick to act on what you think.
Be friendly to people but don’t overdo it.
Once you’ve tested out your friends and found them trustworthy, hold onto them.
But don’t waste your time shaking hands with every new guy you meet.
Don’t be quick to pick a fight, but once you’re in one, hold your own.
Listen to many people, but talk to few.
Hear everyone’s opinion, but reserve your judgment.
Spend all you can afford on clothes, but make sure they’re quality, not flashy, since clothes make the man—which is doubly true in France.
Don’t borrow money and don’t lend it, since when you lend to a friend, you often lose the friendship as well as the money, and borrowing turns a person into a spendthrift.
And, above all, be true to yourself.
Then you won’t be false to anybody else.
Good-bye, son.
I hope my blessing will help you absorb what I’ve said.
I humbly say good-bye to you, father.
Now go, the time is right.
Your servants are waiting.
Good-bye, Ophelia.
Remember what I’ve told you.
It’s locked away in my memory, and you’ve got the key.
Good-bye.
What did he tell you, Ophelia?
Something about Hamlet.
A good thing he did, by God.
I’ve heard Hamlet’s been spending a lot of time alone with you recently, and you’ve made yourself quite available to him.
If things are the way people tell me they are—and they’re only telling me this to warn me—then I have to say, you’re not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show.
What’s going on between you two?
Tell me the truth.
He’s offered me a lot of affection lately.
Affection!” That’s nothing!
You’re talking like some innocent girl who doesn’t understand the ways of the world.
Do you believe his “offers,” as you call them?
I don’t know what to believe, father.
Then I’ll tell you.
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “offers” are something real.
Offer yourself more respect, or—not to beat this word to death—you’ll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock.
Father, he’s always talked about love in an honorable fashion— Yes, “fashion” is just the word—a passing whim.
Go on.
And he’s made the holiest vows to me, to back up what he says.
These vows are just traps for stupid birds.
I know when a man is on fire, he’ll swear anything.
But when a heart’s on fire, it gives out more light than heat, and the fire will be out even before he’s done making his promises.
Don’t mistake that for true love.
From now on, spend a little less time with him and talk to him less.
Make yourself a precious commodity.
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do.
In short, Ophelia, don’t believe his love vows, since they’re like flashy pimps who wear nice clothes to lead a woman into filthy acts.
To put it plainly, don’t waste your time with Hamlet.
Do as I say.
Now come along.
I’ll do as you say, father.
Friends of this country.
And servants of the Danish king.
Good night to you both.
Good-bye.
Who’s taken over the watch for you?
Barnardo’s taken my place.
Good night.
Hello, Barnardo.
Hello.
Is Horatio here too?
More or less.
Welcome, Horatio.
Welcome, Marcellus.
So, tell us, did you see that thing again tonight?
I haven’t seen anything.
Horatio says we’re imagining it, and won’t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we’ve seen twice now.
That’s why I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight, so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it.
Oh, nonsense.
It’s not going to appear.
The air is biting cold.
Yes, it’s definitely nippy.
What time is it?
A little before twelve, I think.
No, it’s just after twelve; I heard the clock strike.
Really?
I didn’t hear it.
So it’s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear.
What does that mean, sir?
The king is staying up all night drinking and dancing.
As he guzzles down his German wine, the musicians make a ruckus to celebrate his draining another cup.
Is that a tradition?
Yes, it is.
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it.
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying.
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles.
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements, as great as they are, and lessens our reputations.
It’s just like what happens to certain people who have some birth defect (which they are not responsible for, since nobody chooses how he’s born), or some weird habit or compulsion that changes them completely.
It happens sometimes that one little defect in these people, as wonderful and talented as they may be, will make them look completely bad to other people.
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations.
Look, sir—here it comes!
Oh angels, protect us!
Whether you’re a good spirit or a cursed demon, whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire, whether your intentions are good or evil, you look so strange I want to talk to you.
I’ll call you “Hamlet Senior,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” Answer me!
Don’t drive me crazy with curiosity, but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin, and why your tomb,
where we quietly buried you, has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again.
What could it mean that you have put on your armor again, you corpse, and have come back to look at the moon, making the night terrifying and stirring us humans with supernatural fears?
Why?
What do you want from us?
What should we do?
It wants you to go off with it, as if it wants to tell you something alone.
Look how politely it’s pointing you to a place that’s farther away.
But don’t go.
Definitely not.
It’s not going to speak, so I’ll follow it.
Don’t do it, sir.
Why, what’s the danger?
I don’t value my life one bit.
And as for my soul, how can the ghost endanger that, since it’s as immortal as the ghost is?
Look, it’s waving me over again.
I’ll follow it.
What if it tempts you to jump into the sea, sir?
Or to the terrifying cliff that overhangs the water,
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane.
Think about it.
The edge of the sea makes people feel despair even at the best of times.
All they have to do is look into its depths and hear it roar far below.
It’s still waving to me.
Go ahead, I’ll follow.
You’re not going, sir.
Let go of me.
Calm down.
You’re not going anywhere.
It’s my fate calling me.
Every nerve in my body is now as tough as steel.
The ghost is still waving me over.
Let me go, gentlemen.
I swear, if anyone holds me back, I’ll make a ghost of him!
I say, get away!—Go ahead, I’ll follow you.
His imagination is making him crazy.
Let’s follow them.
It’s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone.
Go ahead and follow him.
But what does all this mean, where will it all end?
It means that something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
If that’s true, we should let God take care of it.
No, let’s follow him.
Where are you taking me?
Speak.
I’m not going any farther.
Listen to me.
I will.
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory.
Ah, poor ghost!
Don’t pity me.
Just listen carefully to what I have to tell you.
Speak.
I’m ready to hear you.
You must be ready for revenge, too, when you hear me out.
What?
I’m the ghost of your father, doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night, while during the day I’m trapped in the fires of purgatory until I’ve done penance for my past sins.
If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of 
make your eyes jump out of their sockets, and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills.
But mortals like you aren’t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife.
Listen, listen!
If you ever loved your poor dear father— Oh God!
Take revenge for his horrible murder, that crime against nature.
Murder?
His most horrible murder.
Murder’s always horrible, but this one was especially horrible, weird, and unnatural.
Hurry and tell me about it, so I can take revenge right away, faster than a person falls in love.
I’m glad you’re eager.
You’d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of  I knew it!
My uncle?
Yes, that incestuous, adulterous animal.
With his clever words and fancy gifts, he seduced my seemingly virtuous queen, persuading her to give in to his lust.
They were evil words and gifts to seduce her like that!
Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell!
She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine.
But just as you can’t corrupt a truly virtuous person no matter how you try, the opposite is also true: a lustful person like her can satisfy herself in a heavenly union and then move on to garbage.
But hang on, I think I smell the morning air.
So let me be brief here.
Your uncle snuck up to me while I was sleeping in the orchard, as I always used to do in the afternoon, and poured a vial of henbane poison into my ear—that poison that moves like quicksilver through the veins and curdles the blood, which is just what it did to me.
I broke out in a scaly rash that covered my smooth body with a revolting crust.
And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once.
He cut me off in the middle of a sinful life.
I had no chance to repent my sins or receive last rites.
Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible!
If you are human, don’t stand for it.
Don’t let the Danish king’s bed be a nest of incest.
But however you go about your revenge, don’t corrupt your mind or do any harm to your mother.
Leave her to God and her own guilt.
Now, good-bye.
The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near.
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye.
Remember me.
Ah, all you up in heaven!
And earth!
What else?
Shall I include hell as well?
Damn it!
Keep beating, my heart, and muscles, don’t grow old yet—keep me standing.
Remember you!
Yes, you poor ghost, as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head.
Remember you!
Yes, I’ll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there.
Yes, by God!
Oh, you evil woman!
Oh, you villain, villain, you damned, smiling villain!
Where’s my notebook?—It’s a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile, and be a villain.
At least it’s possible in Denmark. 
He said, “Remember me.” I swore I would.
Sir, sir!
Lord Hamlet.— Please let him be all right!
I’m all right.
Oh-ho-ho, sir!
Oh-ho-ho, kid!
Come here.
So how did it go, sir?
What happened, sir?
It was incredible!
Oh, please, tell us, sir.
No, you’ll talk.
I swear I won’t, sir.
I won’t either, sir.
Okay.
But you promise you can keep a secret?
Yes, I swear.
Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe, about what we’ve seen two nights now.
Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us.
Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and I— Quiet, shut up!
It’s come again.
Looking just like the dead king.
Doesn’t he look like the king, Horatio?
Very much so.
It’s terrifying.
It wants us to speak to it.
Ask it something, Horatio.
What are you, that you walk out so late at night, looking like the dead king of Denmark when he dressed for battle?
By God, I order you to speak.
Any villain in Denmark is going to be, well, a villain.
You don’t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that, sir.
Yes, you’re absolutely right.
So, without further ado, the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways.
You go and take care of your business (since everybody has some business to take care of, whatever it is worth), and I’ll go and pray.
You’re talking in such a crazy way, sir.
I’m sorry if I offended you; yes, very sorry.
Oh, don’t worry about it, sir.
No offense taken.
Ah, but there is, Horatio, there’s a lot of offense.
As for this ghost we just saw, he’s a real one, I can tell you that much.
But regarding what happened between us, don’t ask—I can’t tell you.
And now, my friends, my courageous and educated friends, do me one small favor.
What is it, sir?
Of course we will.
Don’t ever tell anyone what you’ve seen tonight.
We won’t, sir.
No, you have to swear it.
I swear to God I won’t.
Me too, I won’t, I swear to God.
Swear by my sword.
But we already swore, sir.
Yes, but swear by my sword this time.
Ha ha, is that what you say, kid?
Are you down there, my man?—Come on, you hear this guy down in the basement.
Agree to swear.
Tell us what to swear, sir.
You swear never to mention what you’ve seen.
Swear by my sword.
You’re everywhere, aren’t you?
Maybe we should move.
Come over here, gentlemen, and put your hands on my sword again.
Swear by my sword you’ll never mention what you’ve heard.
You said it right, old mole.
You’re pretty busy down there in the dirt, aren’t you?
What a tunneler!
Let’s move again, my friends.
My God, this is unbelievably strange.
Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than you’ve even dreamed of.
But now listen to me.
No matter how strangely I act (since I may find it appropriate to act a little crazy in the near future), you must never, ever let on—with a gesture of your hands or a certain expression on your face—that you know anything about what happened to me here tonight.
You must never say anything like, “Ah, yes, just as we suspected,” or “We could tell you a thing or two about him,” or anything like that.
Swear you won’t.
Okay, then, unhappy ghost, you can rest now.
So, gentlemen, I thank you heartily and with all my love, and I’ll repay you however I can some day.
Let’s go back to court together, but 
Give him this money and these letters, Reynaldo.
I will, sir.
It would be wonderfully wise of you, my dear Reynaldo, to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him.
That’s what I thought too, sir.
Excellent, very good.
Ask around and find out what Danish people are in Paris—who they are, where they live and how much money they have, who their friends are.
And if you find out in this general sort of questioning that they happen to know my son, you’ll find out much more than if you asked specific questions about him.
Just tell them you vaguely know Laertes, say something like, “I’m a friend of his father and I sort of know him,” or whatever.
Do you get what I’m saying, Reynaldo?
Yes, very well, sir.
You should say, “I sort of know him, but not well.
Is it the same Laertes who’s a wild party animal?
Isn’t he the one who’s always,” and so on.
Then just make up whatever you want—of course, nothing so bad that it would shame him.
I mean make up any stories that
sound like your average young guy, the kind of trouble they get into.
Like gambling, sir?
That’s right, or drinking, swearing, fist-fighting, visiting prostitutes—that kind of thing.
But that would ruin his reputation!
Oh no, not if you say it right.
I don’t want you to say he’s a sex fiend, that’s not what I mean.
Just mention his faults lightly, so they make him seem like a free spirit who’s gone a little too far.
But, sir— Why should you do this, you want to know?
Yes, sir.
I’d like to know.
Well, here’s what I’m thinking.
I’m quite proud of myself for coming up with this.
As you talk with someone and hint about my son’s faults and little sins, you’ll watch his reaction, and if he’s ever seen Laertes do any of these things, it will only be natural for him to agree with you, at which point he’ll call you “sir,” or “my good friend,” depending on who the person is, where he comes from, and so on.
Yes, sir.
And then he’ll … he’ll … wait, what was I about to say?
Good God, I was about to say something.
What was I saying?
At, “It will be natural for him to agree with you … he’ll call you ‘sir,’ ‘friend,’” et cetera.
It will be natural for him to agree with you.” Ah, yes, that’s right.
If he agrees he’ll say something like this: “Yes, I know the gentleman you’re referring to.
I just saw him yesterday,” or “the other day,” or whenever it is, you know, “and there he was gambling,” or “there he was, totally wasted, or fighting with somebody about a tennis match, or going into a house of ill repute”—that means a whorehouse, you know—or whatever.
Make sure your little lie brings out the truth.
We’re doing this wisely and intelligently, indirectly, finding out things by roundabout means.
That’s how you’ll find out what my son is up to in Paris.
You get my point, don’t you?
Yes, I do, sir.
God bless you.
Have a safe trip.
Thank you, sir.
Don’t forget to see what he’s up to with your own eyes.
Don’t trust gossip.
I will, sir.
And I hope he’s studying his music like he’s supposed to.
Got it, sir.
Good-bye.
Ophelia, what’s the matter?
Oh, father, father, I’ve just had such a scare!
From what, in God’s name?
Father, I was up in my room sewing when Hamlet came in with no hat on his head, his shirt unbuttoned, and his stockings dirty, undone, and down around his ankles.
He was pale as his undershirt, and his knees were knocking together.
He looked so out of sorts, as if he’d just come back from hell.
He came up to me.
Is he crazy with love for you?
I’m not sure, but I’m afraid he might be.
What did he say?
He grabbed me by the wrist and held me hard, then backed away an arm’s length and just looked at me, staring at me like an artist about to paint my picture.
He stayed like that a long time.
Finally, after shaking my arm a little, and jerking his head up and down three times, he sighed like it was his last breath.
After that he let me go.
He left the room with his head turned back on me, finding his way out without looking, since his eyes were on me the whole time.
Come with me.
I’ll go tell the king about this.
This is definitely love-craziness.
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct, as much as any strong emotion.
I’m so sorry.
Did you tell him anything that might have hurt his feelings lately?
No, father, but I did what you told me to do and sent back his letters and wouldn’t let him visit me.
That’s what made him crazy.
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that.
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation.
Damn my suspicious thoughts!
It’s as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy.
Come on, let’s go see the king.
We’ve got to discuss this matter, which could cause more trouble if we keep it secret than if we discuss it openly.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away.
You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before.
I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death.
Since you both grew up with him and are so familiar with his personality and behavior, I’m asking you to stay a while at court and spend some time with him.
See if you can get Hamlet to have some fun, and find out if there’s anything in particular that’s bothering him, so we can set about trying to fix it.
Gentlemen, Hamlet’s talked a lot about you, and I know there are no two men alive he’s fonder of.
If you’ll be so good as to spend some time with us and help us out, you’ll be thanked on a royal scale.
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command, instead of asking us so politely.
But we’ll obey.
Our services are entirely at your command.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz.
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son, who’s changed too much.
Servants, take these gentlemen to see Hamlet.
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good!
Amen to that!
The ambassadors are back from Norway, sir.
Once again you bring good news.
Do I, sir?
I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty both to my God and my good king. 
It looks like you’ve offended it.
Look, it’s going away.
Stay!
Speak!
Speak!
I order you, speak!
It’s gone.
It won’t answer now.
What’s going on, Horatio?
You’re pale and trembling.
You agree now that we’re not imagining this, don’t you?
What do you think about it?
I swear to God, if I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes I’d never believe it.
Doesn’t it look like the king?
Yes, as much as you look like yourself.
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway.
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles, traveling on the ice in sleds.
It’s weird.
It’s happened like this twice before, always at this exact time.
He stalks by us at our post like a warrior.
I don’t know exactly how to explain this, but I have a general feeling this means bad news for our country.
And I believe—unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be—that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy.
Tell me!
I want very much to find out.
All right, but first let the ambassadors speak.
Then you can hear my news, as dessert.
Then be so kind as to show them in.
Gertrude, he says he’s found out the reason for your son’s insanity.
I doubt it’s anything but the obvious reason: his father’s dying and our quick marriage.
Well, we’ll get to the bottom of it.
Welcome, my good friends.
Tell me, Voltemand, what’s the news from the king of Norway?
Greetings to you too, your Highness.
As soon as we raised the matter, the king sent out messengers to stop his nephew’s war preparations, which he originally thought were directed against Poland but learned on closer examination were directed against you.
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’s arrest.
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again.
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand  I like this news, and when I have time I’ll read this and think about how to reply.
Meanwhile, thank you for your efforts.
Go relax now.
Tonight we’ll have dinner.
Welcome back!
Well, that turned out well in the end.
Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time.
Therefore, since the essence of wisdom is not talking too much, I’ll get right to the point here.
Your son is crazy.
Crazy” I’m calling it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness?
But that’s another story.
Please, stick to the point.
Madam, I’m doing nothing but sticking to the point.
It’s true he’s crazy, and it’s a shame it’s true, and it’s truly a shame he’s crazy—but now I sound foolish, so I’ll get right to the point.
Now, if we agree Hamlet’s crazy, then the next step is to figure out the cause of this effect of craziness, or I suppose I should say the cause of this defect, since this defective effect is caused by something.
This is what we must do, and that’s exactly what needs to be done.
Think about it.
I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty.
Listen and think about this:  Hamlet wrote this letter to Ophelia?
Madam, please be patient.
I’ll read it to you.
Oh, Ophelia, I’m bad at poetry.
I can’t put my feelings into verse, but please believe I love you best, oh, best of all.
Believe it.
Hamlet.” Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter, and more like it.
She’s told me all about how Hamlet has been courting her—all the details of where, and what he said, and when.
And how did she react to all this?
Sir, what is your opinion of me?
I know you are loyal and honorable.
I would like to prove to you that I am.
But what would you have thought of me if I had kept quiet when I found out about this hot little love (which I noticed even before my daughter told me about it)?
My dear queen, what would you have thought of me if I had turned a blind eye to what was happening between Hamlet and my daughter?
No, I had to do something.
And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league.
You have to end this.” And then I gave her orders to stay away from him, and not to accept any messages or little gifts from him.
She did what I said.
When she rejected Hamlet, he became sad, and stopped eating, stopped sleeping, got weak, got dizzy, and as a result lost his mind.
And that’s why he’s crazy now, and all of us feel sorry for him.
It may be, it certainly may be.
Has there ever been a time—I’d really like to know—when I’ve definitely said something was true, and it turned out not to be true?
Not that I know of.
What can we do to find out if it’s true?
Well, you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time.
Yes, he does.
When he’s there next time, I’ll send my daughter to see him.
to CLAUDIUS) You and I will hide behind the  We’ll try what you suggest.
Look how sadly he’s coming in, reading his book.
Please go away, both of you.
I’ll speak to him now.
Oh, please let me.
How are you, Hamlet?
Fine, thank you.
Do you know who I am?
