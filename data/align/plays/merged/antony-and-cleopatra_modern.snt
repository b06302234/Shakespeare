I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again.
But if Antony is alive, healthy, friendly with Caesar, and not Caesar’s prisoner, I’ll shower you with gold and pearls.
Madam, he’s well.
That’s well spoken.
And he’s friendly with Caesar.
You are an honest man.
Caesar and he are better friends than ever.
I’m going to make you a rich man.
But yet, madam— I don’t like the sound of “but yet.” It reverses all the good that came before it.
Damn those words, “but yet!” “But yet” is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal.
Please, my friend, give me all the news, both good and bad, at the same time.
You say he’s friendly with Caesar, healthy, and free.
I didn’t say free, madam.
No, I didn’t say that.
He’s bound to Octavia.
For what favor?
For the favor of sleeping in her bed.
I’m sick, Charmian.
He’s married to Octavia, madam.
May you die of the worst disease!
Good madam, be patient.
What did you say to me?
Get out, you horrible bastard, or I’ll gouge out your eyes.
I’ll scalp you.
I’ll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle, making your pain linger.
Gracious madam, I only brought the news.
I didn’t make the match.
If you say it isn’t true, I’ll give you a province and make you rich.
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me.
And on top of that I’ll give you whatever you ask for.
He’s married, madam.
Rogue, you’ve lived too long!
No way, then, I’ll run.
What’s the matter with you, madam?
I haven’t done anything to you.
Good madam, restrain yourself.
The man hasn’t done anything wrong.
Even innocents cannot always escape disaster.
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes.
Call that servant back.
Even though I’m mad, I won’t bite him.
Call him!
He’s afraid to come in.
I won’t hurt him.
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior, especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress.
Come here, sir.
It may be honest, but it’s never wise to bring bad news.
You can give good news in many ways, but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it.
I’ve only done my duty.
Is he married?
I can’t hate you any more than I already do if you repeat that he is.
He’s married, madam.
May the gods destroy you!
Do you maintain the same story?
Do you want me to lie, madam?
Oh, I wish you had lied, even if it meant half my kingdom would be submerged and filled with snakes.
Go, get out!
Even if you were as handsome as  I beg your highness’ pardon.
Is he really married?
Please don’t be offended that I don’t want to offend you any more.
It’s not fair to punish me for something you make me do.
He’s married to Octavia.
It’s too bad that Antony’s fault should make you look like a jerk.
You didn’t have anything to do with it.
Go away.
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me.
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you.
Be patient, your highness.
When I have praised Antony, I’ve disparaged Caesar.
Many times, madam.
I’m being repaid for that now.
Help me out of here.
I feel faint.
Oh, Iras, Charmian!
It doesn’t matter.
Good Alexas, go ask that fellow to describe Octavia.
How old is she?
What kind of disposition does she have?
Don’t let him leave out the color of her hair.
Bring me his answers quickly.
Let Antony be purged from my life forever—but no, don’t let him, Charmian.
Even though half of him is like a 
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost the most consummate Alexas, where’s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen?
Oh, I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife!
What can I do for you?
I can understand a few of nature’s infinite secrets.
I don’t make fortunes; I only see them.
Then see a good one for me.
Your beauty will be even greater than it is now.
No, he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old.
May my wrinkles forbid that!
Don’t joke about his predictions.
Pay attention.
Quiet!
You will love more than you are loved.
It’s proper that we speak first, which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration.
If you’ve had time to think over these points, let us know whether they will relieve your frustration.
If yes, then a lot of brave young men can return to Sicily who would otherwise die here.
I address the three of you, the sole rulers of this world and the main arbiters of the gods’ will.
I don’t know why my father’s death shouldn’t be avenged, since he has a son and friends to do it.
You avenged Julius Caesar’s death at Philippi, where his ghost haunted his killer, Brutus.
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar?
And why did the honorable, well-intentioned Brutus and the others, men devoted to the ideal of freedom, assassinate Caesar?
They didn’t want one man to be king in Rome.
And that’s why I’ve built my navy, which is so huge that the weight of the ships makes the sea foam with anger.
I will punish Rome for her ingratitude toward my noble father.
Take your time.
Pompey, you cannot frighten us with your navy.
We’ll meet you at sea.
You know that on land our army is far greater than yours.
Yes, on land you do outnumber me.
Even more since you annexed my father’s house and lands.
But since,  To get back to the matter at hand, what do you think of our proposal?
That’s the point.
Don’t let us talk you into anything, but consider carefully the value of our offers.
And consider the possible consequences of fighting against us, in the hopes of gaining a greater fortune.
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia.
In return, I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome.
If I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented.
That’s our offer.
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer.
But Mark Antony made me somewhat angry.
Let me shake your hand.
I didn’t think I would see you here.
The East is very seductive.
I have you to thank for my trip here; I wouldn’t have left Egypt otherwise, and I have benefited from it.
Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face, but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage. 
It’s good we had this meeting.
I hope it works out for the best, Lepidus.
So we are in agreement.
Please have the contract written up so we can all sign it.
That’s the next thing on the agenda.
We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways.
Let’s draw lots to see who will host the first one.
I’ll give the first one, Pompey.
No, Antony.
Pick one of these lots.
Whether your banquet is first or last, your Egyptian cooking will make it the best.
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there.
You’ve heard a lot.
I mean well, sir.
I’m sure you do.
I’ve heard a lot more.
I heard that Apollodorus carried—   What did he carry, please?
A certain queen to Caesar,  Now I know who you are.
How are you, soldier?
I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four feasts are being prepared. 
Let me shake your hand.
I’ve never been your enemy.
I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill.
Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave.
Enjoy your frankness; it suits you.
I invite you all aboard my ship.
After you, my lords?
Show us the way, sir.
Come with me.
I think it was at sea.
That it was, sir.
You’ve done well at sea.
And you’ve done well on land.
I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished on land cannot be denied.
Neither can my accomplishments at sea.
Yes, for your own safety, you should deny one thing: you have been a great thief at sea.
As you were on land.
That’s the one part of my service on land I do deny.
But let’s shake hands, Menas.
If our eyes were policemen, they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing.
Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do.
But no beautiful woman has an honest face.
That’s no lie.
They steal hearts.
We came here to fight against you.
For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match.
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune.
If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying.
That’s the truth, sir.
We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here.
Is he married to Cleopatra?
Caesar’s sister is named Octavia.
That’s true, sir.
She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife.
But she is now Mark Antony’s wife.
Excuse me, sir?
It’s true.
Then Caesar and he will always be united.
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t say that.
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love.
I think so too.
But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them.
Octavia has a pious, chaste, meek disposition.
Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that?
Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition, meaning Mark Antony.
He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish.
Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that brought them together will part them.
Antony will go where his passion is.
He only married out of political necessity.
Then that’s the way it may turn out.
Come on, sir, will you come aboard?
I want to drink your health.
I’ll join you, sir.
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt.
Let’s go.
Here’s where they’ll end up, on the floor.
Some of them are leaning already.
It won’t take much for them to fall over.
Lepidus is red in the face.
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor.
Their various personalities grate on one another.
Lepidus cries, “No more arguing!” and then when they agree he resigns himself to drink.
Which goes on to impede his judgment.
That’s what happens when you partner with great men but lack their power.
I’d rather carry a reed that obviously can’t protect me than a sword I cannot lift.
To be so unimportant in the company of important men is like having a face without any eyes.
This is how they do it, sir: they measure the depth of the Nile, according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid.
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty.
The higher the Nile flows, the better the harvest.
As the river ebbs, the farmer scatters his seeds on the remaining silt.
The harvest comes shortly after that.
Do you have unusual snakes there?
Yes, Lepidus.
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud, just like the crocodile.
Yes, Lepidus.
Let’s have a seat and some wine.
A toast to Lepidus!
I don’t feel so well, but I won’t stop.
Not until you pass out.
I’m afraid you’ll keep going until then.
No, I certainly won’t stop.
I’ve heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid.
Without doubt I’ve heard that.
What does a crocodile look like?
Sir, it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width.
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs.
It lives on what nourishes it, and when  What color is it?
Its own color.
It’s a strange snake.
It is that.
And its tears are wet.
What is it?
I’ve always had great respect for your destiny.
You’ve served me faithfully.
What else can I say?
Stay away from the quicksand of drink, Lepidus: you’re sinking.
What are you saying?
Would you like to be king of the entire world?
Now I’ve said it twice.
How could that happen?
Just consider it.
Though I seem poor, I am the man who will give you the world. 
Just listen to him.
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune.
Tell me that I’ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them.
Tell me I’ll have a child when I’m fifty who will be honored even by  You will outlive the Queen.
Oh, excellent!
I love long life better than  You have already had better fortune than the future will bring.
Then my children will probably be illegitimate.
Tell me, please: how many boys and girls will I have?
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one, you would have a million children.
Get out of here, you fool!
Since you’re a fortuneteller I won’t bring charges of witchcraft against you.
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish.
We’ll all want our fortune told.
My fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed.  
Are you drunk?
No, Pompey, I haven’t had anything to drink.
You can be the most powerful man on earth if you dare use your power.
Both land and sea are yours if you will take them.
Tell me how.
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat.
Let me cut the anchor cable.
When we are away from land, cut their throats.
Everything that belongs to them is yours.
Oh, you should have done it without telling me!
For me to do such a thing would be dishonorable.
For you to do it would be good service.
You should know that to me, profit isn’t more important than honor, but the other way around.
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions.
If you had acted without my knowledge, I would have approved your action later.
But now I must condemn it.
Give it up and go drink.  
This toast is for Lepidus!
Here’s to you, Menas.
I accept with thanks, Enobarbus.
Fill the cups until they run over.
There goes a strong fellow, Menas.
Why do you say that?
He carries a third of the world.
Can’t you see that?
Then a third of the world is drunk.
I wish it were all drunk.
Then everything would go more smoothly.
Drink up.
Liven up the party.
All right, then.
This hasn’t reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet.
It’s getting there.
Clink your cups together in a toast!
Here’s to Caesar.
I could do without another toast.
It’s unnatural.
I keep washing my brain with alcohol, and it keeps getting fouler and more muddled.
Live in the moment.
I’d prefer to seize the day.
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one.
Let’s have one, good soldier.
Come, let’s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful.
Everyone join hands.
Attack our ears with loud music, and I’ll position you for the dance.
Then the boy will sing, and every man will sing the chorus at the top of his voice.
How can you top that?
Good night, Pompey. 
We’ll have a rematch at your feast on shore.
Yes, we will.
Let’s shake on it.
Oh, Antony, even if you’ve taken my father’s house, what is that to me?
We’re friends!
Come, this way to the rowboat.
Be careful not to fall in.
Menas, I’m not going back on shore.
No, come to my cabin.
We’ll have the musicians play drums, trumpets, flutes.
What do you say?
We’ll make  Hooray, I say.
There’s my hat!
Hooray!
Come on, noble captain.
Now I’ve paid you back, Parthia, and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus’ death.
Carry  Noble Ventidius, while your sword is still warm with the blood of slain Parthians, why not finish the job?
The Parthians retreat.
Go after them.
Chase them down if you have to track them through  Oh, Silius, Silius, I’ve done enough.
A subordinate may exceed his authority.
You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s absence.
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person.
Sossius, an officer that held the same position in Syria as I do here, achieved great distinction very quickly but lost Antony’s support as a result.
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain’s rival.
Ambition is a good quality in a soldier, but it proves detrimental rather than beneficial when used to surpass his superiors.
I could do more to help Antony, but to do so would insult him.
And by insulting him, I would lose credit for the good I have done him already. 
A soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your qualities, Ventidius.
Are you going to write Antony about this?
I’ll modestly tell him what I have done in his name—that’s the magical wording these days.
I’ll write how, under his flag and with his well-paid troops, we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia.
Where’s Antony now?
He plans to go to Athens.
We must arrive there before him, as quickly as our baggage train will allow us. 
Did the brothers-in-law leave?
They finished their business with Pompey, and Pompey has left.
Now the three triumvirs are putting their official seals on the treaty.
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome.
Caesar is in a sober mood.
And Menas reports that Lepidus has been hungover since Pompey’s party.
He’s a stylish man.
And how he loves Caesar!
Yes, but how he adores Mark Antony!
Caesar?
Then what’s Antony?
A god of a god?
Are you talking about Caesar?
He’s without equal!
Oh, Antony!
Oh, you  If you want to praise Caesar, just say his name—that’s all the praise that’s necessary.
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments.
He loves Caesar best, but he also loves Antony.
Oh!
No one can describe or fathom Lepidus’ love for Antony!
Hearts cannot think it, tongues cannot speak it, meas-urements cannot calculate it, scribes cannot write it, bards cannot sing it, and poets cannot make verses about it.
But when it comes to Caesar, Lepidus’ love approaches the awestruck wonder of a worshipper.
He loves them both.
They are his dung, and he their beetle.
So, there’s the signal to ride.
Good-bye, noble Agrippa.
Good luck, worthy soldier, and good-bye.
You can’t go any further with us, sir.
You take an important part of myself with you.
Treat it well . . . .
Sister, be the kind of wife I hope you will be, and that this great contract rests upon your being . . .
Gracious Antony, don’t let my sister, this epitome of virtue that connects us, become the reason we separate.
If you and I don’t value her equally, it would be better for us to work out our differences without her.
Don’t insult me with your distrust.
I mean what I say.
You won’t find any cause for anxiety, even if you look for one.
So, may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support.
We’ll leave you here. 
Good-bye, my dearest sister, good-bye.
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease.
Farewell.
My noble brother!
Her eyes are like April: full of showers.
But they’ll flower into love.
What is it, Octavia?
I’ll tell you privately.
She won’t say what she’s feeling, and she can’t understand her feelings.
She’s balanced uneasily, like a feather on the swell of a great wave—she won’t move, even though her situation is about to change.        
Come here, sir.
I’ll wrestle with you out of love.
See, now I have you.
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods.
Good-bye.
Be happy.
Farewell, farewell.
Farewell.
Like the  Oh stop it, you lusty bed-hopper.
You can’t see the future.
Well, if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity, then I can’t scratch my own ear.
Your fortunes are the same.
But how?
How is that possible?
Give me details.
I’ve said what I have to say.
Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers?
By an inch, even?
Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?
Not in my husband’s nose.
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts!
Alexas!
Amen, dear goddess.
Listen to our prayer.
If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful.
Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves.
Where is that messenger?
He’s afraid to come in.
Oh, come on.—Come here, sir.
Gracious Queen, even Herod of Judea wouldn’t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood.
I’ll have Herod’s head chopped off!
But now that Antony’s gone, who will do it for me?
Most formidable Queen!
Did you see Octavia?
Yes, revered Queen.
Where?
In Rome, Madam.
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony.
Is she as tall as I am?
She is not, madam.
Did you hear her speak?
Is her voice pitched high or low?
Madam, I heard her speak.
She has a low-pitched voice.
That’s not in her favor.
He can’t like her very long.
Like her?
Oh, Isis, that’s impossible.
You’re right, Charmian.
She’s both dull-spoken and dwarfishly little.—Did she carry herself with majesty?
Compare her to any memory you might have of royalty.
She creeps along.
Moving or standing still, her bearing is about the same.
She has a body, not a life.
She’s more like a statue than a living, breathing human being.
Is this true?
If not, then I have no powers of observation.
There aren’t three people in all of Egypt who could do better.
He’s very observant.
I can tell.
She doesn’t have anything going for her so far.
This messenger is wise.
Very wise.
She was a widow previously, madam.
A widow?
Do you hear that, Charmian?
And I think she’s at least thirty.
Do you remember her face?
Was it long or round?
Round enough to be unattractive.
Usually that means a person is foolish.
What color is her hair?
Brown, madam, and she wouldn’t want her forehead to be any lower.
Here’s gold for you.
You mustn’t hold my earlier outburst against me.
I’ll hire you again to go back to Rome.
I find that you’re very good at this kind of work.
Go, prepare to travel.
My letters are ready to go.
He’s an admirable man.
He certainly is.
I’m very sorry I was so hard on him.
Why, from what he says, Octavia isn’t worth getting upset over.
Not a bit, madam.
This man’s been around royalty.
He should recognize it when he sees it.
Been around royalty!
Isis forbid it were otherwise, since he’s been in your service so long.
I want to ask him one more thing, Charmian.
But it’s not important.
Bring him to my writing room.
Everything may still be all right.
I assure you it is, madam.
No, no, Octavia, it’s not only that.
That would be excusable—that and a thousand other offenses like it.
But Caesar has gone and waged a new war against Pompey.
Oh, dear husband, don’t believe everything you hear—or if you must believe it, don’t let it all make you angry.
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree.
I’ll be left in the middle, praying for both sides.
The good gods will laugh at me when on the one hand I pray for my husband and on the other for my brother.
Let my husband win!” “Let my brother win!” One prayer cancels out the other.
There’s no middle ground between these two extremes.
Gentle Octavia, support the one that supports you.
If I’m defeated, I lose my reputation.
If I lose my reputation, I lose myself.
It would be better for you to have no husband than a husband who lacks honor.
However, as you requested, you may go and try to negotiate with your brother.
In the meantime, I’ll raise an army that will surpass his.
Go as soon as possible, so your prayers may be answered the sooner.
Thank you, my lord.
May the god of power make me, the weakest of the weak, your mediator.
A war between you two would split the very world, and the bodies of your slaughtered soldiers would have to fill the chasm between.
When you find out who started this disagreement, turn your anger upon them.
Our faults can’t be so alike that you would judge us similarly.
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions.
Spend as much as you like.
How goes it, friend Eros?
Some startling news has just arrived, sir.
What news, man?
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey.
That’s old news.
Who’s winning?
Caesar used Lepidus in the war, but as soon as it was over, Lepidus was expelled from the triumvirate.
He wasn’t allowed any of the glory of the victory, and he was accused of treasonous correspondence with Pompey.
On the basis of Caesar’s accusation alone, Lepidus was imprisoned.
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him.
So now the world will only be devoured by two sets of jaws—Caesar’s and Antony’s.
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them, they’ll battle each other to the death to have it all.
Where’s Antony?
He’s walking in the garden, like this  Antony’s grand navy is prepared.
To sail to Italy and Caesar.
Another thing, Domitius: Antony wants to see you now.
I should have waited to tell you my news.
It won’t be that important.
But never mind.
Take me to Antony.
Come with me, sir.
In Alexandria he condemned Rome, and that’s not all.
This is what happened: he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace.
He did this in public?
In the public arena, where they perform sporting events.
He proclaimed his sons to be kings of kings.
He gave Media, Parthia, and Armenia to Alexander.
He gave Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia to Ptolemy.
Cleopatra was dressed like the goddess Isis.
They say she often attended her public functions like that.
Let’s send this news to Rome.
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already.
They’ll abandon him completely when they hear this.
The people have heard it already, and they’ve been told of his accusations.
Who does he accuse?
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius’ possessions, which we seized in Sicily.
Then he says I didn’t return some ships he loaned me.
Finally, he criticizes the deposing of Lepidus, and then goes on to accuse me of keeping all of Lepidus’ property for myself.
Sir, these accusations should be answered.
It has been done already, and the messenger is on his way.
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position.
For this he deserved to be deposed.
As for what I seized in the wars, I granted that Antony should have a share.
But I also demanded my share of his acquisitions in Armenia and the other conquered kingdoms.
He’ll never agree to that.
Then we won’t agree to his demands.
Greetings, Caesar, my lord!
Greetings, dearest Caesar!
Oh, to think you’ve been rejected!
You’ve never thought of me like that, and you have no reason to.
Then why did you travel so quietly?
You didn’t arrive like Caesar’s sister.
Antony’s wife should have an army to escort her, with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears.
The trees along the road should have been filled with eager spectators.
Crowds should have been faint with excitement waiting to see you.
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven.
But you’ve arrived like a common maid bringing goods to a Roman market.
You’ve kept me from displaying my love—and when love is not shown, it’s often not felt.
I would have met you by sea and again by land.
At each stage of your trip there would have been a more spectacular greeting.
My good lord, I wasn’t forced to travel like this.
It was my choice.
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him.
When he gave me this news, I begged him to let me visit you.
Which he quickly allowed, given that you’re an obstacle to his lust.
Amen.
Quiet!
Here comes Antony.
It’s not him; it’s the Queen.
Have you seen my lord?
No, lady.
Wasn’t he here?
No, madam.
He was in a good mood, and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome.
Enobarbus?
Madam?
Find him and bring him here.
Where’s Alexas?
Here, at your service.
Here comes my lord.
Your wife, Fulvia, mustered her army first.
Against my brother Lucius?
Yes.
But that war ended as soon as circumstances made it advisable for them to join together against Caesar.
But in their very first battle, Caesar won and drove them out of Italy. 
Don’t say that, my lord.
I’ve kept track of him, and reports of his affairs arrive on every ship.
Where do you think he is now?
He’s in Athens, my lord.
No, he’s not.
You’ve been deceived.
Cleopatra summoned him.
He’s given his empire to a whore, and now they’re gathering kings to wage a war.
He’s recruited Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; King Manchus of Arabia; the King of Pont; Herod, of Judea; Mithridates, King of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas, the kings of Mede and Lycaonia, and many more.
Oh, I’m heartbroken.
I’m divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other.
You’re welcome here.
I didn’t write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations.
Cheer yourself.
Don’t be troubled by the present situation, the obligations of which must ruin your happiness.
Don’t worry about things that have already been decided by fate.
Welcome home to Rome.
Nothing is more precious to me than you.
You have been unbelievably abused, and now the gods make us the dispensers of justice.
Be comforted.
You will always be welcome to me. 
Welcome, lady.
Welcome, dear madam.
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you.
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you, giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us.
It’s undeniable.
You are welcome here, sister.
I beg you to continue to be patient.
My dearest sister!
I’ll be straight with you.
Do not doubt it.
But why, why, why?
You opposed my taking part in the war.
You said it wasn’t proper.
Well, is it?
Is it?
Isn’t this war against me?
Why shouldn’t I be there in person?
Well, I could answer that if we went to war on male and female horses alike—the male horses would be totally distracted and useless.
The mares would be ridden by their riders and the male horses.
What do you mean?
Antony will necessarily be distracted by your presence.
You will affect his heart and his head.
You’ll take up time he can’t afford to lose.
He’s already criticized for frivolous behavior.
In Rome they say that your eunuch Photinus and your maids run the war.
Let Rome fall!
May the tongues of our critics rot!
I have responsibilities in this war, and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man.
Don’t argue against it.
I won’t stay behind.
No, I’ve had my say.
Here comes the Emperor.
Isn’t it strange, Canidius, that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne?—Have you heard about this, sweet?
No one admires speed more than the lazy.
That’s a good reprimand, suitable for reminding even the best of men to guard against negligence.
Canidius, we’ll fight him at sea.
Of course we’ll fight him by sea.
What else?
Why do you want to do that, my lord?
Because he’s daring us to do it.
So you’ve dared him to single combat.
Yes, and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia, where he fought against Pompey.
But Caesar ignores offers that don’t give him an advantage, and so should you.
Your ships are not well crewed.
Your sailors are mule drivers, harvesters—men who were drafted quickly and have little training.
Caesar’s fleet is manned by mariners who already have experience battling Pompey.
His ships are maneuverable.
Yours are slow and awkward.
Refusing to fight him at sea won’t disgrace you.
You’ve prepared for a land war.
I will fight by sea.
By sea.
Most worthy sir, if you do that you throw away all the advantages you have on land.
You will have to divide your army, which mostly consists of battle-hardened foot soldiers.
You will be unable to use your legendary battle knowledge.
You’ll be abandoning proven methods that promise victory, and instead you’ll put yourself at the mercy of haphazard chance.
I’ll fight at sea.
I have sixty ships.
Caesar doesn’t have any that are better.
We’ll burn our surplus ships and fully man the rest.
We’ll sail from Actium and beat Caesar as he approaches.
Even if we fail at that, we can still fight him on land.
What’s your business?
The news is true, my lord.
Caesar has been seen.
He has captured Toryne.
Can Caesar be there in person?
No, that’s impossible.
It’s strange enough that his army should be there.
Canidius, take our nineteen 
What’s the news, brave soldier?
Oh, don’t fight by sea, noble Emperor!
Don’t trust rotten planks.
Don’t you trust my sword and these wounds?
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming.
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe.
Well, well, let’s go.
By Hercules, I think I’m right.
Soldier, you are.
But Antony’s decisions aren’t coming from his extensive experience.
Our leader is being led.
We are following a woman.
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together, don’t you?
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius will go by sea, but we’ll keep the bulk on land.
Caesar’s speed defies belief.
While he was still in Rome, he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled.
Who’s his lieutenant, do you know?
A man named Taurus, they say.
I know the man well.
The Emperor is calling for Canidius.
The present time is like a woman in labor, each minute giving birth to some piece of news.
Taurus!
My lord?
Don’t attack by land.
Keep the army together.
Don’t provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea.
Don’t exceed your orders as written here.
Our fate depends on this chance.
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill, in sight of Caesar’s navy.
From there we’ll be able to see how many ships he has and plan accordingly. 
We’re ruined, ruined, ruined!
I can’t watch any more.
The Egyptian flagship, the  Gods and goddesses—the whole congregation of them!
What’s wrong with you?
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness.
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces.
How goes the battle?
Our side shows all the signs of certain defeat, which appear like the symptomatic sores of the plague.
Right in the middle of the fight, just when the battle could have gone either way—actually we had a slight advantage—that immoral Egyptian nag—May she die of leprosy!—suddenly became frightened, and turned her ships around and fled.
I saw that.
The sight made me so sick I couldn’t watch any more. 
Well, give me the worst news.
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it.
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward.
Go on.
As far as I’m concerned, what’s past is done.
It’s like this: as long as a person tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as though he praised me.
The news is disturbing.
While Antony . . .” is what you want to say.
Oh, my lord!
Speak plainly.
Don’t tone down what the people are saying.
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her.
Use Fulvia’s abusive language.
Freely scold me for my faults with as much severity as an enemy with truth on his side.
It’s easy to err when left to our own devices, but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them.
Good-bye for a while.
Once she had turned around, the noble Antony, ruined by love, hoisted his own sails and followed her like a lovesick duck.
He left the battle at the most crucial point.
I never saw such a shameful act.
He betrayed his own experience, manhood, and honor.
Terrible.
Terrible.
The battle on the sea is almost lost.
If our general had been his old self, we would have won.
Oh, with his sordid desertion, he sets the example for our own.
Are you considering desertion, as well?
Then everything must really be finished.
They fled toward Peloponnesus.
It’s easy to get there.
I’ll go there and ascertain their next move.
I’ll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar.
In this, I follow the examples of the six kings who have already surrendered.
I’ll still follow Antony, even though the odds are against him and good sense tells me I should go the other way.
Listen.
The earth tells me to stop walking upon it, as it’s ashamed to carry me.
Friends, come here.
I’m completely lost.
I have a ship full of treasure.
Take that.
Divide it.
Escape and make peace with Caesar.
Flee?
Not us.
I have already fled from my true self.
I’ve told cowards to turn their backs on me and run.
Friends, go.
I’ve decided on a plan that doesn’t require your assistance.
Leave.
My treasure’s in the harbor; take it.
Oh, I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now!
Even my hair revolts.
The white hairs blame the brown hairs for being irresponsible, and the brown ones blame the white ones for being spineless and foolish.
Friends, go.
I’ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you.
Please, don’t be sad, and don’t tell me how reluctant you are.
Take your cues from my own despair.
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself.
Go to the harbor immediately!
I’ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure.
Just give me a moment, please—only a moment.
I’ve relinquished my authority, so please—I’ll see you all before long.
No, gentle madam, go.
Comfort him.
Yes, do, dearest Queen.
Of course you must comfort him!
What else?
Let me sit down.
Oh,    Do you see her, sir?
Oh, damn, damn, damn!
Madam!
Madam, oh, good Empress!
Sir . . .
sir . . .
Ah, give us some privacy.
The Queen is here, my lord.
Go to him, madam, speak to him.
He’s not himself because he feels so ashamed.
Well, then, help me.
Most noble sir, stand up.
The Queen is coming.
She’s weak and will die unless you comfort her.
I’ve destroyed my reputation, a most shameful error.
Sir, here’s the Queen.
Oh, where have you led me, Egypt?
See how I hide my shame from you by turning around?
I look behind me to see my past, destroyed by dishonor.
Oh, my lord, my lord, forgive my panic!
I didn’t think you would follow me.
Queen, you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you.
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods’ orders in favor of yours.
Oh, forgive me!
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man.
I’ve done as I pleased with half the world, making and losing fortunes, but now I negotiate from a position of weakness.
You knew how far you had conquered my spirit.
You knew that my sword, weakened by my love for you, would obey that love no matter what. 
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Don’t shed even one tear.
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost.
Give me a kiss.
This repays me.
I sent our children’s schoolmaster to Caesar with our offer.
Has he returned?
Love, I am full of heaviness. 
Let the envoy from Antony come in.
Do you know him?
It’s Antony’s schoolmaster.
By sending such an insignificant emissary, Antony shows us how low he has sunk.
Not so long ago, he had so many royal supporters that he sent along extra kings as messengers.
Come forward and speak.
Humble as I am, I represent Antony.
Until recently, I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean.
So be it.
Say what you’re here for.
He acknowledges that you are the master of his fate, and he requests to be allowed to live in Egypt.
If that is not granted, he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens.
That’s all he asks for himself.
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority.
She only asks that the crown of Egypt pass to her heirs, who are now at your mercy.
As for Antony, I’m not interested in his requests.
I’ll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him.
Then I’ll listen to her.
Give my answer to them both.
May good luck follow you!
Take him safely through the lines.
I go, Caesar.
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions.
I will, Caesar.
What are we going to do, Enobarbus?
Think about our situation, then die.
Who is to blame for this: Antony or I?
Only Antony was at fault.
He put his desire in charge of his reason.
So what if you ran from the battle, terrified, as ranks of ships threatened one another?
Why should he have followed you?
With half the world opposing the other half, it wasn’t the time for Antony, the pivotal player, to let love distract him.
To race after your departing ships, leaving his navy to watch, was a shame as great as the resulting loss.
Please, let’s not talk about it.
Is that his answer?
Yes, my lord.
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up?
That’s what he says.
Tell her. 
Your head, my lord?
A messenger has arrived from Caesar.
With no more ceremony than that?
See, ladies, how they scorn me now.
They pinch their noses to avoid smelling the dying rose whose scent, as a bud, they happily inhaled.
Show him in, sir.
I’ll be at your service.
What’s the news from  The man from Sicyon— Is he here?
He’s waiting outside.
Have him come in.
What’s your message?
Your wife, Fulvia, is dead.
Where did she die?
In Sicyon.
In this letter you’ll find details of her illness and other, more serious matters that concern you.
Leave me.  
What does Caesar want?
It is for your ears only.
There are only friends here.
Speak confidently.
So they are possibly Antony’s friends.
Sir, he should have as many as Caesar has.
If he had that many friends, then he wouldn’t need us.
If Caesar chose, Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend.
As for us, you know we are Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s.
So be it.
This, then, this is the message Caesar sends to you, famous Queen: he implores you not to be concerned about your situation.
Just remember that he is Caesar.
Respectfully put.
Go on.
He knows that you didn’t embrace Antony because you loved him, but because you feared him.
Oh!
So he regrets that any dishonorable acts were forced on you, not being performed of your own free will.
He is like a god and knows the truth.
My honor wasn’t given; it was only dominated.
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him?
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you.
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you.
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection.
What’s your name?
My name is Thidias.
Most kind messenger, tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand.
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him.
Tell him—whose decrees are obeyed by the whole world—that I will accept the fate he chooses for Egypt.
That’s your most dignified course of action.
When confronted with the choice between a prudent action and a risky one, a wise man should dare to do only what he can practically accomplish—if he follows this course, he will never be subjected to unpredictable chance.
Allow me to pay my respects by kissing your hand.
When Octavius Caesar’s father thought about conquering kingdoms, he rained kisses on my unworthy hand.
Promising favors?
By Jove that thunders!
Who are you, slave?
A person who merely follows the orders of the best man, the man most worthy of service.
You will be whipped.  
Take away this lout and whip him.
By the moon and stars!
Whip him!
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand—what’s her name now?
This woman who once was Cleopatra, but now has become something different?
Whip him, fellows, until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy!
Take him away.
Mark Antony— Pull him away, and once he has been whipped, bring him back.
Caesar’s knave will bring him a message for us.
My good lord— You’ve always been a liar.
But when our vices become habits—Oh, the sadness of it!—the wise gods blind us, shade our better judgment, make us love our mistakes, and laugh as we strut to our ruin. 
Oh, has it come to this?
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar’s plate when I met you.
No, you were one of Gneius Pompey’s leftovers—not to mention your other, more depraved affairs, which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip.
For I’m sure that although you may know what temperance is, you’ve never experienced it firsthand.
Why are you doing this?
To let a servant be familiar with my little toy, your hand—a hand that has signed royal treaties and pledged your love to me—oh, if only I were standing on the hill of  Has he been whipped?
Soundly, my lord.
Did he cry?
Did he beg my pardon?
He did ask for mercy.
Are you done yet?
You, my earthly moon, are now eclipsed, and that alone foretells my ruin.
In order to flatter Caesar, would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants?
Don’t you know me still?
Has your heart cooled toward me?
Ah, dear, if that is true, let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart, and let the first hailstone drop down my throat.
As it dissolves, so shall my life.
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion, until one by one all my children, and every one of my brave Egyptians, are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied, covered by gnats and flies.
I am satisfied.
Caesar has made camp in Alexandria.
I will fight him there.
Our land forces have bravely stood firm.
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail, as formidable as the sea itself.
Where have you been, my bravery?
Do you hear what I say, lady?
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips, I’ll be covered in blood.
My sword and I will earn our place in history.
We still have hope. 
That’s my brave lord!
I’ll be triple the soldier I was in strength, bravery, and stamina.
I’ll fight brutally.
In the days when I had better luck, prisoners of war could buy their freedoms from me with simple trinkets.
But now I’ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me.
Come, let’s have one more extravagant night.
Invite all my sad captains.
Fill our wine bowls again.
Let’s drink through midnight.
It’s my birthday.
I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again.
We’ll win yet.
Do so.
I’ll speak to them, and then tonight I’ll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds.
Come on, my Queen.
There’s still life in our cause.
The next time I fight, I’ll make Death love me.
I’ll compete even with his fatal scythe.
Now he’ll work himself up to a fury.
Rage scares away a man’s fear.
In that state, a dove will attack an ostrich.
I have always noticed that when my captain’s reason is diminished, his bravery increases.
When courage consumes reason, it destroys its only weapon.
I’ll look for some way to leave his service.

He calls me “boy” and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt.
He whipped my messenger with rods.
He dares me to personal combat, Caesar against Antony.
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die, and in the meantime, we’ll laugh at his challenge.
Caesar must realize that when a man as powerful as Antony begins to rage, he has been pursued to the point of collapse.
Don’t give him time to catch his breath.
Take advantage of his unreasonable rage.
Anger does not protect the angry well.
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow’s battle to be the last we fight.
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony’s former soldiers—enough to capture him.
See that it is done, and prepare a feast for the soldiers.
We have enough supplies for it, and they’ve earned it.
Poor Antony!
What would you like, sir?
I have to leave right away.
That will kill our lovers.
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them.
If we leave, it will feel like nothing less than death to them.
I must be gone.
If it’s that important, then let the women die.
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing, but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause, then they’re worthless.
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately.
I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason.
I think there must be something invigorating about death, since she dies with such enthusiasm.
She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine.
Alas, sir, no, her feelings come from pure love, not cleverness.
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods.
She has more storms and tempests in her than a weather almanac.
Her temper is not a trick or a skill—if it is, she can make it rain as well as  I wish I’d never seen her!
Then you’d have missed an amazing piece of work, sir, and your trip would have been poorer for the loss. 
He won’t fight with me, Domitius?
No.
Why won’t he?
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours, it would be like pitting twenty men against one.
Tomorrow, soldier, I’ll fight by sea and land.
By the end I will either live, or else I’ll restore my honor by shedding my blood.
Will you fight well?
When I strike, I’ll cry, “All or nothing!” Well put.
Come on.
Call out my household servants.
Tonight let’s have plenty to eat.
Give me your hand; you’ve been truly honest—so have you and you—and you—you too.
You have all served me well, and kings are your peers.     
The gods forbid!
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants, obeying my commands.
What are you doing, sir?
You’re making them uncomfortable.
Look—they’re crying.
And I’m just foolish enough to tear up myself.
It’s embarrassing.
Don’t turn us into women. 
Ha, ha, ha!
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that!
Those tears will bring blessings to you.
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense, my hearty friends.
I spoke to encourage you, asking that you help me make this night a brilliant one.
You should know, my friends, that I have good hopes for tomorrow, and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death.
Let’s go to supper.
Come, and let’s drown our worries.
Good night, brother.
Tomorrow is the day.
This battle will determine who wins the war.
Take care of yourself.
Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city?
No.
What was it?
It was probably just a rumor.
Good night.
Well sir, good night.
Soldiers, watch carefully.
You too.
Good night.
Good night.
This is our station.
And if our navy wins tomorrow, no doubt our army will do their part.
It’s an outstanding army and highly motivated.
Quiet!
What’s that sound?
Listen!
Listen!
Listen!
There’s music coming out of thin air.
From under the earth.
It’s a lucky sign, isn’t it?
No.
Quiet, I say.
What does this mean?
It means that  Let’s walk over and see if the other soldiers heard the same thing.
Hello there, good sirs.
Yes.
Isn’t it strange?
Do you hear that, men?
Do you?
Let’s follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops.
Good idea.
It’s very strange.
Get a little sleep.
No, my dear . . .
Eros, come on, bring my armor, Eros.
Come on, good fellow, help me into that armor you’re carrying.
If luck deserts us today, it’s because we defy it.
Come on.
No, I’ll help too.
What’s this part for?
Ah, leave it alone.
Leave it alone!
You armor my heart.
No!
No!
That part goes there.
Really, I’ll help.
It must go like this.
Yes, well done.
We’ve got it now.—Do you see this, my good fellow?
Go and put on your own armor.
In a minute, sir.
Didn’t I buckle this well?
Excellently, excellently.
Anyone who unbuckles this before I want to take it off to rest will be sorry.—You’re fumbling, Eros.
My Queen’s a better squire than you are.
Hurry.—Oh, love, if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft.
Good morning to you.
Welcome.
You look like a person who knows the business of war.
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully.
Even though it’s early, there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor.
The weather is fair.
Good morning, General.
Good morning, General.
That was a fine fanfare, boys.
Like a young man who wants to amount to something, this morning begins early.
Farewell, lady.
Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier’s kiss.
It would be shameful to draw out our good-byes.
I’ll leave you without revealing any emotion, like a man of steel. 
If it pleases you, let’s go to your room.
Lead the way.
He goes forth to war bravely.
If only he and Caesar could determine the outcome of this war by single combat!
Then Antony would—but, with circumstances as they are—well, let’s go.
May the gods bless Antony today!
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land.
If you had, the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you.
Who deserted this morning?
You don’t know?
Someone who was always near you.
If you call for Enobarbus, he won’t hear you.
Or if he can hear you from Caesar’s camp, he’ll reply, “I’m no longer on your side.” What are you saying?
Sir, he’s with Caesar.
Sir, he left his belongings and treasure.
He’s gone?
It’s certain.
Eros, send his treasure to him.
Do it now.
Don’t keep anything back, I insist.
Write to him from me—I’ll sign it—sending greetings and gentle good-byes.
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master.
Oh, my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors.
Hurry.
Enobarbus!

Fulvia is dead.
Pardon me?
Fulvia is dead.
Fulvia?
Dead.
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks.
When a man’s wife dies, he can be comforted by the knowledge that there are replacements to be found.
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth, there would be a reason to grieve.
But in this way, grief and comfort appear together.
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose.
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started.
The business you began here needs you as well—especially the business with Cleopatra, which only you can attend to.
Enough of this frivolous talk.
Give our officers notice of our intentions.
I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave.
Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return.
Sextus Pompeius has challenged Caesar.
His fleet controls the sea.
Our fickle citizens—who never reward service until that service is over—are now giving all the rights and honors won by Pompey the Great to his son, Sextus.
Sextus has great honor and power, and his spirit and energy are even greater, all of which makes him the most formidable soldier in the empire.
The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential.
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats.  
Agrippa, go start the battle.
We want Antony taken alive.
Make sure everyone knows that.
I will, Caesar.
An era of universal peace is about to start.
If this battle goes well for us, there will be peace in all  Antony has come onto the battlefield.
Go order Agrippa to put the men who deserted Antony’s army at the front.
That way Antony will feel like he’s fighting his own men.
Alexas deserted.
He went to Judea as if on Antony’s business, but he persuaded Herod to support Caesar instead.
Caesar hanged him for this service.
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust.
I’ve done a bad thing, for which I will blame myself so much that I’ll never be happy again.
Enobarbus, Antony has sent you all your treasure, with generous gifts besides.
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent.
It’s yours.
Don’t joke about this, Enobarbus.
I’m telling you the truth.
You’d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return.
I’d do it myself, but I can’t leave my post.
Your Emperor is still a king among gods.
I am the worst person alive, and I know it the best.
Oh, Antony, you extravagantly generous man, how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold!
My heart feels like it’s about to explode.
If grief doesn’t kill me, I’ll find a quicker way to kill myself—even though I think grief will do the job just as well.
I, fight against you, Antony?
No, I’ll go find some ditch to die in.
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life.

Retreat!
We’ve advanced too far.
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected.
Oh, my brave Emperor, this is what I call a fight!
If we’d fought like this before, we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads.
You’re bleeding a lot.
I had a scar here that looked like a “T”; now it’s an “H.” They’re retreating.
We’ll chase ’em into their latrines.
I still have room for six more wounds.
They’re retreating, sir, and our superiority indicates a clear victory.
Let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits, from behind.
It’s fair game to mark a coward.
I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage.
Come on. 
I’ll limp after you.
We’ve driven him all the way back to his camp.
One of you run to the Queen with the news.
Before sunrise tomorrow, we’ll kill anyone who escaped today.
I want to thank all of you.
You’re formidable.
You fought not as if you served the cause but as though it were as much your personal fight as mine.
You are all    Lord of lords!
Your courage is infinite.
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world? 
My songbird, we have beaten them to their beds.
What do you think, girl!
Even though there are some gray hairs among the brown, I still have a brain and muscles that will let me compete with younger men.
Look at this man.
Show him favor by letting him kiss your hand.
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind.
He deserves it, even if it were covered with jewels like holy 

If we aren’t relieved in an hour, we have to return to our barracks.
The night is bright, and they say we’ll be forming for battle by two a.m.  That last day was a hard one for us.
Oh, listen to me, night— Who is this?
Stay hidden and listen.
Be my witness, oh you blessed moon.
The men who revolted against Antony will be remembered scornfully in the history books.
But poor Enobarbus repented.
That’s Enobarbus?
Quiet!
Keep listening.
Oh, moon, you queen of sadness, drop poisonous dew on me so that my life, which continues against my wishes, will end.
Take my heart and throw it against my hard, stony sin.
My heart, which dried out with grief, will surely break apart into a powder, and that will be the end of my disgusting mind.
Oh, Antony!
You are more noble than my revolt is dishonorable.
Forgive my crimes against you, but let history record me as a fugitive traitor.
Oh, Antony!
Oh, Antony!
Let’s speak to him.
Let’s listen to him.
He may say something concerning Caesar.
Good idea.
But he’s sleeping.
It looks more like he fainted.
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep.
Let’s go to him.
Wake up, sir, wake up.
Speak to us.
Do you hear us, sir?
The hand of death has taken him.
Listen.
The drums softly wake the sleepers.
Let’s carry him to the barracks.
He’s an important person.
Our hour is up.
Come on, then.
He may recover yet.
I will.
They’ve switched their operation to the sea today.
We didn’t please them on land.
We’re ready for both, my lord.
I wish they’d fight in fire or in the air.
We’d meet them there too.
But here’s the plan: our army will stay with us on the hills by the city.
Orders have been given to the navy and they’ve left port.
We’ll be able to analyze and direct the battle better from the hills.
We won’t move our land forces unless we’re attacked.
And I doubt that will happen, since most of Antony’s men are with his navy.
Let’s take up the best positions we can in the valleys.
They still haven’t joined the battle.
I’ll be able to see better from that pine tree over there.
I’ll let you know right away how it’s going.
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra’s sails.
The fortunetellers won’t say whether that’s a good sign or a bad one, but they don’t look happy.
Antony is valiant and dejected.
His mood changes by fits and starts; his checkered luck vacillates between hope and fear, winning and losing.
All is lost!
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me.
My fleet has surrendered to the enemy.
You can see them over there throwing their hats up in the air and drinking together like long lost friends.
Three-time traitor and whore!
It’s you who have sold me to this youth, Caesar.
Now my war is only with you.
Tell the army to flee.
Revenge on Cleopatra will be my last act.
Order them to escape.
Go!
Oh, sun, I will never see another one of your sunrises.
Luck and Antony separate here and now.
Here we’ll shake hands good-bye.
Is it all come to this?
The brave men who followed me like little dogs, whom I rewarded, have left me to follow Caesar.
I’ve been stripped of everything, betrayed.
Oh, that devious Egyptian spirit!
Her charms launched my wars and called them back again.
Pleasing her was my main goal, and she lured me to total defeat.
Ah, you sorceress!
Be gone!
Why is my lord enraged against his love?
Get out of my sight, or I’ll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar’s victory.
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds!
Follow his chariot, like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender.
Let them exhibit you to the public for meager coins, like a monstrosity.
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails.
If you wish to live, you had better get out of here.
But I think it would have been better if you’d let me kill you.
One death would have prevented the deaths of many others.—Eros, ho!— She sold me to that young Roman boy and now I’m ruined.
She’ll die for it.—Eros, ho!
Help me, ladies!
Oh, Antony is more furious than Telamon, who killed himself in a jealous rage.
The wild boar of Thessaly, which the goddess Diana sent to punish King Caledon for neglecting her sacrifices, didn’t foam at the mouth as much as Antony does now.
Go to your tomb!
Lock yourself in and send him word that you’re dead.
When a great person departs, it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body.
To my tomb!
Mardian, go tell him I’ve killed myself.
Say the last word I spoke was “Antony,” and please word it pathetically.
Go, Mardian, and let me know how he reacts to my death. 
Eros, can you still see me?
Yes, noble lord.
Sometimes we see a cloud that looks like a dragon.
Sometimes there’s a cloud like a bear or a lion, a castle, a floating rock, a craggy mountain.
Or it might look like a blue cliff with trees on it that bow to the ground.
These things fool our eyes by seeming solid, when they are actually only air.
You’ve seen these illusions.
They’re spectacles that appear at sunset.
Yes, my lord.
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind, made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water.
That’s true, my lord.
Eros, my young friend, your captain is now just like that cloud.
Here and now I seem like Antony, but I can’t keep myself in this form, my boy.
I went to war to save Cleopatra, whose love I thought I had, since she had mine—and mine carried with it a million others, those of my soldiers, now lost.
The Queen conspired with Caesar to undermine my success and assure his victory.
No, don’t cry, kind Eros.
We still have the option of killing ourselves.
Oh, your contemptible lady!
She has disarmed me.
No, Antony.
My mistress loved you, and her destiny was completely joined with yours.
Get out, insolent eunuch!
Silence!
She has betrayed me and shall die.
A person can only pay with their life once, and she has paid in full.
What you wanted is yours.
Her last words were “Antony!
Most noble Antony!” Then, as she was speaking your name, a strangled groan split her words.
Antony” was divided between her heart and lips.
She gave up her life with your name still within her.
Is she dead, then?
Dead.
Remove your armor, Eros.
The long day’s work is over, and it is time to sleep.
Off!
Take off my armor.
Not even Ajax’s famous shield, made of seven layers of oxhide and covered in bronze, could protect my heart from this attack.
Oh, chest, obey me!
Heart, for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined.
Break out of my ribcage!
Faster, Eros, faster.
I won’t be a soldier anymore.
Battered armor, be off.
You were worn with honor. 
I will catch up with you, Cleopatra, and weep for your forgiveness.
It’s the only way left, because now any extension of my life would be torture.
Since the light of my life has gone out, I’ll stop here.
Now any effort ruins what it attempts.
Yes, even power gets in its own way.
End it, then, and everything is over.—Eros!—I’m coming, my Queen!—Eros!—Wait for me.
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor.
Those famous lovers, Dido and Aeneas, will lose their admirers, and the whole place will be devoted to us.—Come, Eros.
Eros!
What can I do for my lord?
Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace.
Though I have made conquests throughout the four corners of the world and sailed with fleets so large they looked like floating cities, I don’t have as much courage as a woman.
I have less nobility than the lady who, by killing herself, says to Caesar, “Only Cleopatra can defeat Cleopatra.” You promised me, Eros, that should the ultimate moment arrive—which it has—when dishonor and disgust are inevitable, that upon my command, you would kill me.
Do it.
This is that time.
You won’t be striking me down, but defeating Caesar.
Call up your courage.
The gods forbid!
Can I do what all the Parthian arrows, though shot by enemies, could not?
Eros, would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar’s victory parade, his arms crossed and tied, his head bowed in submission, his face red from shame, while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him, putting the final stamp to his humiliation?
I would not.
Then come on.
I must be restored to health by an injury.
Draw your trustworthy sword, which you have used in such service to your country.
Oh, sir, pardon me!
When I freed you from slavery, didn’t you swear to do this when I asked you?
Do it immediately, or all your previous services to me were accidental, without purpose.
Take out your sword and come on.
Then turn your noble face away from me, that face that the whole world adores.
Look!
Where is he?
I haven’t seen him recently.
Madam, I think if you love him so much, you aren’t using the best way to get him to reciprocate.
What should I do that I’m not doing?
Always give him his way.
Never contradict him.
You advise me like a fool.
That’s the way to lose him.
Don’t push him too far.
I wish you’d be patient.
We come to hate that which controls us.
But here comes Antony.
I am sick and sullen.
I’m sorry to have to say this— Help me away from here, dear Charmian!
I shall faint.
I won’t be able to go on this way much longer.
Human nature isn’t built to withstand this.
I have drawn my sword.
Now let it carry out its purpose immediately.
My dear master, my captain, my sovereign, let me say before I strike this fatal blow: farewell.
You’ve said it, friend, and farewell to you.
Good-bye, great commander.
Should I do it now?
Now, Eros.
Well, then, there!
With this I avoid the grief of Antony’s death.
Brave Eros, three times more honorable than I am!
You teach me what I should do but could not.
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books.
But I will embrace death as a bridegroom does his bride, and rush to it as to a lover’s bed.
Come then.
Eros, your master dies your student.
I learned to do this from you. 
What!
I’m not dead?
Not dead?—Guard, here!
Oh, kill me!
What’s the trouble?
I’ve botched the job, friends.
Oh, finish what I’ve begun.
Our guiding light is out.
And time itself is ended.
Sadness and despair!
Whoever’s a real friend should strike me dead.
Not me.
Me neither.
None of us.
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape.
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor.
Where’s Antony?
There, Diomedes, there.
Is he still alive?
Why don’t you answer me, man?
Is that you, Diomedes?
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me.
Most powerful lord, my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you.
When did she send you?
Just now, my lord.
Where is she?
Locked in her tomb.
She had a premonition of what has actually happened.
She saw that you suspected her of negotiating a treaty with Caesar—which never will be true.
Afraid that your anger would not subside, she sent you word she was dead.
But later, fearing how that news might affect you, she sent me to tell you the truth.
I’m afraid I’ve come too late.
Too late, good Diomedes.
Call my guard, please.
Hey out there!
Emperor’s guards!
Guards, hey!
Come!
Your lord calls for you!
Carry me, good friends, to where Cleopatra is.
It’s the last command I shall ever give you.
We’re very sorry, sir, that you may not live to wear us out with your commands.
It’s a very sad day.
No, my friends, don’t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well.
If we welcome our punishment, we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly.
Pick me up.
I have often led you, now you must carry me, my good friends—and take my thanks for everything.
Oh, Charmian, I will never leave this tomb!
Be calm, dear lady.
No, I won’t.
Strange and terrible events are all welcome, but I despise comforts.
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source.
What’s the news!
Is he dead?
He is close to death, but not dead yet.
Look out the other window; his guard has brought him here.
Oh, sun, burn up the orbit in which you move, so that the world may be dark forever!
Oh, Antony, Antony, Antony!
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Help, friends below; lift him up here.
Be calm!
It was not Caesar’s bravery that conquered Antony but Antony’s that has triumphed over himself.
That’s the way it should be—only Antony should conquer Antony.
But how terrible that it has happened!
No, our general’s infatuation is out of control.
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops.
Now his eyes devote themselves exclusively to a certain brown-skinned face.
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights, but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore.
Look at them.
Take a good look, and you’ll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore’s jester.
Look and see.
If what you feel is really love, tell me how much.
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated.
I want to measure the extent of your love, to see how far it stretches.
Then you would have to go beyond heaven, beyond earth.
I have news from Rome, my good lord.
Which irritaties me.
Give me a summary.
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
I just beg death to wait awhile, until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips.
I don’t dare come down—forgive me, my lord—I don’t dare, for fear of capture.
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar’s prize.
If knives, poison, or snakes have edge, effect, or venom, I am safe from that fate.
Your wife Octavia, with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions, won’t get any praise from patronizing me.
But come.
Come up here, Antony—help me, ladies—we must carry you up.
Help us, good friends.
Oh, quick, before I’m gone.
Such exercise!
My lord is so heavy!
Our strength has all turned into sadness.
That’s what makes the weight.
If I had the goddess Juno’s power, I would make the strong-winged messenger, Mercury, pick you up and seat you beside Jove.
Up just a little more—wishes are always foolish—oh, come on, come on, come on!
And welcome, welcome!
Die where you have lived, in my arms.
Let me revive you with my kisses.
If my lips had the power to give life, I would wear them out like this.
What a sad sight!
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
Give me some wine and let me say a few words.
No, let me talk, and let me scold to the heavens, so that  One thing, dear Queen: request honor, as well as safety, from Caesar.
Oh!
Honor and safety do not go together.
Dear, listen to me: don’t trust any of Caesar’s men besides Proculeius.
I’ll trust my determination and my hands, but none of Caesar’s men.
Don’t mourn over this unhappy reversal of fortune at the end of my life.
Remember my earlier lot, when I lived as the greatest, most noble prince in the world.
I’m not dying shamefully, doffing my helmet to my countryman like a coward, but as a Roman, honorably conquered by another Roman.
Now I feel my soul leaving.
I can’t speak any more. 
Most noble man, will you die?
Don’t you care about me?
Shall I stay in this dreary world, which is no better than a pigsty without you?
Oh, look, ladies.
The best of the world disappears.
My lord!
Oh, the glory of war has faded.
The flags have fallen.
Young boys and girls are equal to men.
There is nothing distinctive, nothing remarkable left in the world.
Oh, stay calm, lady!
Our Queen is dead too.
Lady!
Madam!
Oh, madam, madam, madam!
Royal Egypt, Empress!
Quiet, quiet, Iras.
Now I am no more than a woman, ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores.
I might now hurl my scepter at the destructive gods and tell them that this earthly world was as good as their heavenly one, until they stole away its jewel, Antony.
Now all is for nothing.
Patience is foolish.
Impatience suits a mad dog.
So why should it be a sin to rush toward death, to seek it out in its hiding place before it dares to come to find me?
How are you, my ladies?
Tell me!
Cheer up!
How are you, Charmian?
My gallant girls!
Ah, ladies, look: the light of our lives has gone out.
Good noble ladies, be brave.
We’ll bury him, and then we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans, and make death proud to take us.
Come on, you can go.
The container of that great soul is now cold.
Ah, ladies, ladies!
Let’s go.
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death.

Dolabella, go see Antony.
Tell him to surrender.
His position is hopeless.
This delay makes him look ridiculous.
Right away, Caesar.
What are you doing with a sword?
Who do you think you are coming in here armed?
My name is Decretus.
I served Mark Antony, who was the commander most worthy of my services.
While he was alive, I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies.
If you accept my service, I’ll serve you the same way.
If not, you can kill me.
What are you saying?
Caesar, I’m telling you that Antony is dead.
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap.
The fractured world, in its confusion, should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens.
This isn’t the death of one man.
It’s the death of half the world. 
Now, my dearest Queen— Please, stand farther away from me.
What’s the matter?
I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news.
What, does your wife say you can come home?
I wish she’d never let you come.
Don’t let her say I kept you.
I have no power over you.
You belong to her.
The gods know— Oh, never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been.
I knew from the first it would be this way.
Cleopatra— How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true, even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves—you, who were unfaithful to Fulvia?
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart.
Such false vows are broken as soon as they are spoken.
Most sweet Queen— No, please don’t try to excuse your departure.
Just say good-bye and go.
When you begged to stay, that was the time for words.
You didn’t want to go then!
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes, and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows.
Then, all my parts seemed angelic to you.
My features are still that beautiful—or else you, the greatest soldier in the world, have become the greatest liar by overpraising them.
He’s dead, Caesar.
Not by public execution or an assassin’s knife.
He killed himself with the same hand that performed such brave acts.
With the courage his heart lent his hand, his hand in turn split his heart.
This is his sword.
I pulled it from his wound.
Look—his noble blood is still on it.
Listen, sad friends, though the gods may rebuke me, this news would make kings cry.
It’s strange that human nature makes us grieve for the very thing we’ve been trying to achieve.
His faults were equally matched by his virtues.
There was never a ruler as excellent as he.
But gods, you give us faults so we’ll be human.
Caesar is upset.
It’s impossible for him not to see himself in Antony.
Oh, Antony.
I drove you to this.
But we have to get rid of a disease if it threatens our body.
Either I had to ruin you, or you would have ruined me.
There wasn’t enough room in the world for both of us.
Even so, let me mourn, with tears that heal like a bloodletting, that you—my brother, my greatest competitor, my partner in rule, my friend and companion on the battlefield, the very arm of my body, and the heart in which mine own heart’s thoughts lived—that our fates could not be reconciled, which caused us to divide ourselves from one another.
Let me tell you, friends—
I’ll tell you at a better time.
This man looks like his business is urgent.
Let’s hear what he has to say.
A poor Egyptian, but my mistress, the Queen, sent me to find out what your intentions are concerning her.
She’s locked up in her tomb and wants to prepare herself for her fate.
Tell her to put her mind at rest.
She’ll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her.
I cannot be taught how to be cruel.
May the gods bless you.
Come here, Proculeius.
Tell her we mean her no disrespect.
Give her whatever assurances you feel she needs to keep her from killing herself.
I need her alive, so that I can exhibit her in my triumphal procession and gain eternal fame.
Go, and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind. 
I will, Caesar.
Gallus, you go with him.
Where’s Dolabella?
He’s supposed to support Proculeius.
Dolabella!
Never mind.
I remember he’s already occupied.
He’ll be done in time.
Come with me.
In my tent I’ll show you how unwillingly I was drawn into this war.
You’ll see how calm and gentle my letters to Antony always were.
Come and see the proof.
Being alone has helped me better understand my life.
It’s pathetic to be Caesar.
He can’t be Fortune; he’s only Fortune’s errand boy.
It would be a great deed to commit suicide—that act which ends all other things, which makes all accidents and changes stop.
Which causes you to sleep, and takes you away from earthly concerns.
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him.
What’s your name?
My name is Proculeius.
Antony told me about you.
He said you were a man I could trust.
But I don’t worry about being deceived because I don’t need to trust.
If your master wants a queen to beg from him, you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom.
If he will grant me conquered Egypt, so that I may give it to my son, I will kneel to him with thanks.
Be content.
You’re in the charge of an honorable man.
Don’t be afraid.
You can ask for anything from my lord.
His generosity flows to anyone in need.
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly, he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you.
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune.
I give up to him the glory he has won.
I’m learning every hour how to be subservient.
I’d be happy to meet with him in person.
I’ll tell him all of this, dear lady.
Be at ease.
I know he’s sorry for your situation, especially since he caused it.
Your majesty!
Oh, Cleopatra!
You’ve been betrayed, my Queen!
Quick, quick good hands!
Stop, brave lady, stop!
Don’t do such a shameful thing to yourself.
We’ve rescued you from yourself.
We have not betrayed you.
What, am I being denied death, as well?
The thing which even dogs are given, to rid them of their suffering?
Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself.
The world will see how noble he is by the way he treats you.
Your death would prevent that.
Where are you, Death?
Come here.
Come, and you can have a queen.
One queen is worth more than a whole number of babies and beggars, your cheapest conquests.
Oh, control yourself, lady!
Sir, I won’t eat.
I won’t drink.
And don’t expect me to talk.
I won’t sleep either.
I’ll destroy my body.
Let Caesar do whatever he wants.
You’d better understand that I won’t wait till I’m chained up in your master’s court, and I won’t let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia.
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome?
I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt, and make it my gentle grave.
I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me, making me disgusting.
I’d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids!
You’re letting yourself get carried away with these horrible thoughts.
You’ll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so.
Proculeius, Caesar has heard about what you’ve done here and has sent for you.
I’ll take the Queen into my custody.
So be it, Dolabella.
Caesar’s thanks are my greatest reward.
Be kind to her.
Tell him I’d like to die.
Have you heard of me, most noble Empress?
I don’t remember.
I’m sure you’ve heard of me.
It doesn’t matter what I’ve heard or known.
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams.
Isn’t that your habit?
I don’t know what you mean, madam.
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony.
Oh, I wish I could sleep again, so I could have another dream like that!
If you’d like— Authority radiated from his face, and his presence brought knowledge and order to the people of earth.
Your majesty— His power extended from one shore to the other, as if he straddled the ocean with his legs.
When he raised his arm in command, the world trembled.
He spoke exquisitely to his friends, but when he wanted to terrify the world, his voice was like thunder.
There was no end to his generosity.
The more he gave, the more he wanted to give.
His amusements showed another side of him, one detached from his world of responsibility and duty.
Kings and noblemen served him.
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change.
Cleopatra— Do you think there ever was, or could there ever be, a man such as the one I dreamed about?
No, gentle madam.
The gods can hear you lying!
But if there ever were such a man, simple dreams could never contain his greatness.
When it comes to creating fantastical things, the natural world cannot compete with imagination.
And yet, if the natural world could create something like Antony, it would have a masterpiece to rival anything fantasy might construct.
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings.
Listen to me, madam.
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable.
You are responding appropriately to the greatness of that loss.
I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now.
Thank you, sir.
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me?
I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew.
Please, sir— Though he is honorable— He’ll still parade me through Rome as a trophy of war.
I know he will, madam.
Stand aside for Caesar.
Which of these ladies is the Queen of Egypt?
Arise.
You need not kneel to me.
Please rise, Queen.
The gods have ordained it to be like this, sir.
You are my lord and master.
I must obey.
Don’t think I blame you.
Whatever injuries I received in the war, I put down to the fortunes of war.
You are now the sole lord of the entire world.
I can’t explain my cause very clearly.
I must admit to having the weaknesses that all women are accused of.
Cleopatra, understand that, rather than emphasize our power over you, we will soften if you accept our intentions, which are very compassionate toward you.
Your acceptance will benefit you, but if you try to make me look cruel by committing suicide as Antony did, I won’t be so generous.
Your children will be destroyed, a fate your submission will save them from.
I’ll leave you now.
You may do whatever you want in the world.
It’s yours, and you may hang us, your trophies of war, anywhere you like.
Here, my good lord.
What do you mean, lady?
I wish I were as big and strong as you.
Then you’d see the courage that lives in the Queen of Egypt.
Listen to me, Queen.
There is an emergency I must take care of, but my whole heart will remain here with you.
My Italy is full of civil war.
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome.
When two domestic opponents are equally matched—as we are against Pompey—factions will form on the smallest of pretexts.
When a formerly hated man grows powerful, he suddenly finds himself with many supporters.
Pompey, who was once condemned, now wields his father’s power, and all the citizens who have grievances against the government are joining him.
Pompey’s numbers are steadily growing, and the government is ready to do something desperate.
But my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that Fulvia is dead.
I may not have outlived the foolishness of my youth, but I’m not that childishly naïve.
Is it possible Fulvia is dead?
She’s dead, my Queen.
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra.
This is the inventory of the money, silverware, dishes, and jewels that are still in my possession.
It’s an exact list.
Not even trivial things were left out.
Where’s Seleucus?
Here, madam.
This is my treasurer.
My lord, he will swear on his life that I haven’t kept a thing.—Tell the truth, Seleucus.
Madam, I’d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it.
What did I keep for myself?
Enough to buy everything you have declared.
No, don’t be ashamed, Cleopatra.
You’re very prudent to set a little aside.
Look around you, Caesar.
Oh, just see what happens after the pageantry is over!
What is mine will be yours now.
If we were to change places, what is yours would be mine.
Seleucus’ ingratitude makes me wild.
What are you doing?
Cringing away?
I’ll give you a good reason to cringe, I promise you.
I’ll scratch out your eyes, even if they could fly.
You slave!
Soulless villain!
Dog!
Oh, that was unbelievably low!
Good Queen, let me implore you— Oh, Caesar, I am so ashamed.
You condescended to visit me here, honoring my humble self with your lordly presence.
And one of my own servants increases my disgrace by adding his envy!
Suppose, good Caesar, that I have saved a few feminine trifles, some unimportant trinkets.
These have worth only as gifts to friends.
And suppose I have kept a few more expensive gifts aside for  Leave, Seleucus.
You should also know that as head of state, we are often blamed for the crimes of others.
And though we may fall, we are still responsible for their offenses.
I am therefore to be pitied.
Cleopatra, our conquest won’t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed.
It’s all still yours.
Do whatever you like with it.
You can trust that Caesar is not a merchant to haggle with you over your property.
So cheer up.
Don’t be captured by your depressed thoughts.
No, dear Queen.
We want to follow your own counsel when making arrangements for you.
Eat and sleep.
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend.
And so, good-bye.
My master and my lord!
Not true.
Good-bye.
He’s trying to talk me into forgetting my nobility, girls.
But listen, Charmian.
It’s time to end it, good lady.
The bright day of our lives is over, and now there will only be darkness.
I will, madam.
Where’s the Queen?
Look, sir.
Dolabella.
Madam, according to my promise—which my love to you has made a religious vow—I tell you that Caesar intends to travel through Syria.
Within three days you and your children will be sent ahead.
Make the best use of this information you can.
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise.
Dolabella, I will always be in debt to you.
And I your servant.
Good-bye, good Queen.
I must go attend Caesar.
Farewell, and thanks.
Now, Iras, what do you think?
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me, like Egyptian puppets.
Crude slaves with greasy aprons, rulers, and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see.
Their stinking breath will form a cloud around us, and we’ll be forced to inhale it. 
The gods forbid!
No, it’s certain, Iras.
Insolent  Oh, the good gods!
No, that’s the truth.
I’ll never see it.
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes; I’ll scratch them out.
Why, that’s just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions.
Now, Charmian!
Women, dress me like a queen.
Go get my best clothes.
I will once again be as fine as when I went to Cydnus to meet Marc Antony.—Iras, go.—Now, Charmian, we’ll be quick indeed.
And after you’ve done this chore, I’ll give you permission to amuse yourself until doomsday.
What’s that noise?
There’s a farmer here who won’t leave without seeing your Highness.
He has brought you figs.
Let him come in.
What a poor instrument, that can do such a noble deed!
He brings me freedom.
My mind is made up.
There’s nothing of the weak woman left in me.
Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble.
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me.
This is the man.
Leave us.
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain?
I certainly do have him, but I wouldn’t advise you to touch him.
His bite is fatal.
People who die of it seldom or never recover.
Do you remember anyone who died of it?
Many people, men and women alike.
I heard of one just yesterday.
She was a very honest woman but rather inclined to lie—which a woman shouldn’t do unless she’s protecting her reputation.
I heard how she died of its bite, how much pain she felt.
Indeed, she gives a very good testimony of the snake’s power.
But if you believe everything they say, you won’t be saved by half of what they do.
But this is a sure thing: the snake’s an odd snake.
You may leave now.
Farewell.
I hope you are pleased with the snake.
Farewell.
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature.
Yes, yes.
Farewell.
Listen, the snake is dangerous unless handled by people who are used to him.
There isn’t any kindness in the snake.
Don’t worry; we’ll remember your warnings.
Good.
Don’t feed it, I beg you.
It’s not worth feeding.
Will it eat me?
Don’t think I’m so dumb that I don’t know that the devil himself won’t eat a woman.
I know that a woman is a dish fit only for the gods, as long as the devil hasn’t prepared the meal.
But devils cause a lot of trouble for the gods regarding their women.
For every ten women the gods make, the devils ruin five.
Well, you can go now.
Farewell.
Yes, truly, I wish you good luck with the snake.
Give me my robe.
Put on my crown.
I long to be immortal.
I won’t drink Egyptian wine again.
Quickly, quickly, good Iras, quickly.
I think I hear Antony call me.
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act.
I hear him mock Caesar’s luck, which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath.
Husband, I’m coming!
Now let my courage prove my title as wife.
I am now made of fire and air, and I leave the other elements, earth and water, to this mortal life.
So, are you done?
Come then, kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips.
Good-bye, kind Charmian.
Iras, I won’t see you again for a long time.
Do I have the asp’s poison on my lips?
Did you fall?
If you can leave your body so easily, then the touch of death is like a lover’s pinch, which hurts but is desired.
Do you lie still?
If you leave like that, you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good-bye. 
Clouds, dissolve into rain, so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping!
This proves that I’m petty: if Iras meets Antony before me, he’ll want her first and give her the kiss that is my bliss to have.
Come, you deadly villain.
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth.
Poor poisonous fool, be angry and bite.
Oh, if you could speak, I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted!
Oh, eastern star!
Quiet, quiet!
Don’t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep?
Oh, if my heart would only break!
The poison is as sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—Oh, Antony!—No, I’ll take you too.
Why should I stay— In this vile world?
So, good-bye.
Now, Death, you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession.
Close, soft eyes.
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again.
Your crown is crooked.
I’ll straighten it, then play— Where’s the Queen?
Speak softly.
Don’t wake her.
Caesar has sent— Too slow a messenger.
Oh, come quickly!
I almost feel you.
There’s Dolabella, who was sent from Caesar.
Call him.
What kind of work is this, Charmian?
Is this well done?
It is well done, and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings.
Ah, soldier!
What’s going on in here?
They’re all dead.
Caesar, you thought this would happen.
You’re coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop.
Look at this.
Take your royal time and read about the quarrels she encouraged.
And saving the best for last, read when and where she died.
Oh, unfaithful lover!
Stop arguing and listen to my plans.
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you.
I swear by the sun that when I leave here, it will be as your faithful servant.
I will make either peace or war, whichever you prefer.
Cut my corset laces, Charmian, so I can breathe.
Hurry!
No, leave it alone.
I waver easily between sickness and health.
Just as Antony loves.
Control yourself, my precious Queen, and concede that my love is true.
It has endured many genuine trials.
That’s what Fulvia told me.
I beg you, turn away and cry for her.
Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit.
Good.
Now perform a scene for me, using your excellent skills of playacting, and pretend that you’re being honorable and righteous. 
Step aside, step aside for Caesar!
Oh, sir, you are too good at predicting the future.
What you were afraid of has happened.
She was bravest at the end.
She knew what I intended to do with her and, being royal, she took her own way out.
How did they die?
I don’t see any blood.
Who was with them last?
A simple country farmer who brought her figs.
This was the basket.
They were poisoned, then.
Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago.
She stood and spoke.
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress.
She stood trembling, then suddenly dropped dead.
Oh, noble weakness!
If they had swallowed poison, it would be evident by external swelling.
But she looks like she’s asleep, as if she would charm another Antony.
Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark.
There’s a similar mark on her arm. 
This is an asp’s trail, and these fig leaves have slime on them, just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile.
That’s probably how she died.
Her doctor told me she had searched for an infinite number of easy ways to die.
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb.
She shall be buried next to her Antony.
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous.
Momentous events like these strike those that cause them.
Antony and Cleopatra’s story is as pitiable as my military exploits are glorious.
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome.
Come, Dolabella.
See that there is a dignified splendor to this great solemnity.
You’ll make me angry.
No more of this.
I know you can do better than that, but it’ll do for now.
I swear by my sword— Swear by your shield, too!
I’ll leave you, lady.
Polite sir, let me say one thing.
Sir, you and I must part company—no, that’s not it.
Sir, you and I were lovers—no, that’s not it, either.
You already know all that.
There’s something I’d like to—oh, I’ve forgotten what I wanted to say.
Just as Antony has forgotten me.
If you weren’t the queen of immaturity, I’d think you were immaturity itself.
It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart, but bear with me.
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them.
Your honor is the reason you are leaving.
So I beg you not to listen to my foolishness.
May the gods be with you.
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed. 
Let’s go.
Come with me.
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here, you come with me, and even though I leave here, I stay with you.
Now you’ll see, Lepidus, that I don’t disdain our noble ally because of a personal whim.
Here’s the news from Alexandra: Antony fishes, drinks, and celebrates all night.
He’s become as frivolous and self-indulgent as  I can’t believe there could be enough vice in the world to outshine all the good in him.
His faults stand out because they must be compared to all his virtues, like stars that shine brightly against the dark night sky.
They’re more likely to be the result of inherited weakness than independent choice.
You’re too forgiving.
Let’s say, for argument’s sake, that it’s not improper to fool around with Ptolemy’s wife, or to trade a kingdom for a joke.
That it’s fine to engage in drinking matches with inferiors, or stumble drunkenly through the streets in the middle of the day, or get into fist fights with sweaty servants.
Even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself.
If he’s been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits, then he’ll be punished with venereal diseases, and that’s his business.
But he’s wasting time and resources vital to our cause and endangering both his position and ours.
He should be chastised, like any boy who knows what’s right but chooses to satisfy his desires regardless.
Here’s more news.
We’ve followed your commands, lord Caesar.
You shall have hourly updates regarding the situation at sea.
Pompey has a strong navy.
All the people who only stayed with you out of fear are gathering at the port to join him, in the opinion he’s been treated unfairly.
I should have known it.
It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized.
People will transfer their support to a strong figure until he becomes their actual leader.
Then they will value their former leader, even though the loss of their support has made him powerless.
The common crowd changes like the tide, to and fro, serving whoever is on the rise.
Their power is worn away by their fickleness.
Caesar, I have news about Menecrates and Menas, notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships.
They’ve made many raids upon Italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them.
The young, energetic men are joining Pompey.
These pirates can capture a ship as soon as it leaves the harbor, since the simple mention of the name “Pompey” carries as much power as a fleet of troops in battle.
Antony, it’s time to stop your wild hedonism.
When you were defeated at the battle of Modena—where you killed the consuls, Hirtius and Pansa—and then driven away, you had to face hunger and thirst.
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman, you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand.
You drank horses’ urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse.
Though you were used to the finest foods, you didn’t turn up your nose at the bitterest berries on the thorniest bushes.
You even ate bark from trees, as deer do in winter.
Going over the Alps, you ate strange meat that some men would rather die than consume.
And you went through all this—the comparison between then and now shames you—in such a soldier-like way that you didn’t seem to suffer at all.
It’s too bad.
Let’s hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly.
It’s time that we brought our armies into the field.
Let’s call a council of war immediately.
Pompey is making the most of our absence. 
Tomorrow, Caesar, I’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war.
I’ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, my lord.
If you receive any more news, please share it with me.
Don’t worry, that goes without saying. 
Charmian!
Madam?
Ah, give me some  Why, madam?
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone.
You think about him too much.
That’s treason!
I hope not, Madam.
Eunuch!
Mardian!
What can I do for your highness?
I don’t want to hear you sing.
I’m not interested in anything a eunuch can do.
It’s a good thing for you that, being castrated, you can better concentrate on my needs.
Do you have desires?
Yes, dear madam.
Indeed?
Well, not in deed, madam, since I can’t do anything unchaste.
But I do have intense passions—and I do think about  Oh, Charmian, where do you think he is now?
Is he standing or sitting?
Or is he walking?
Or is he on his horse?
Oh, how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him.
Do well, horse.
Do you know whom it is you carry?
A man who carries responsibility for a third of the world on his shoulders.
He’s speaking now, or perhaps he’s whispering, “Where’s my serpent of the Nile?” For that’s his pet name for me.
I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . .
Are you thinking about me?
Even though I’ve been darkened by the sun and wrinkled with age?
Caesar, with your broad forehead, when you were alive, 
No, listen to it, Antony.
Perhaps  What, my love?
Maybe?
No, most likely.
You can’t stay here any longer.
Caesar has sent your dismissal, so pay attention, Antony.
Where’s Fulvia’s summons—excuse me, I should have said Caesar’s.
Or do Fulvia and Caesar both beckon you back to Rome?
Call in the messengers and we’ll find out.
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant.
Or that that bitch Fulvia still has the power to humiliate you.
Call the messengers!  
Queen of Egypt, greetings!
You are nothing like Mark Antony!
But since you come from him, you’re saturated with his healing spirit.
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony?
The last thing he did before sending me off, dear Queen, was to kiss—the last of many such kisses—this Indian pearl for you.
His speech is stored in my heart.
My ear must pull it out.
Good friend,” he said, “say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster’s treasure to the great Queen of Egypt, and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire.
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen.” Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse, which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply.
Was he sad or happy?
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold: he was neither sad nor happy.
Oh, what an even disposition he has!
Observe, observe good Charmian!
That’s exactly how he is!
Just notice.
He wasn’t sad, because he knows that his disposition affects others.
He wasn’t merry, because to be merry would indicate that he had forgotten his love in Egypt.
He was somewhere in the middle, between them . . .
Oh, heavenly mixture!
Whether you are sad or merry, the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . .
Did you meet my messengers on your way here?
Yes, madam, twenty different messengers.
Why did you send so many?
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar.
Bring ink and paper, Charmian.
Welcome, my good Alexas.
Charmian, did I ever love Caesar as much as this?
Oh, that splendid Caesar!
May you choke on any other sentiments like that!
Say, “That splendid Antony.” The courageous Caesar!
By Isis, I’ll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony, my best man among men. 
Pardon me, but I’m just repeating what you yourself have said.
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn’t know what passion was.
If the great gods are just, they will help the most honest men.
You should know, noble Pompey, that although the gods may delay action, that doesn’t mean they will necessarily refuse their help.
But while we pray and wait for that help, the cause we petition for may be lost.
Sometimes we don’t know what’s best for us and ask for things that may harm us.
In that case, the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good.
I’ll do well.
The people are on my side, and I’m in charge of the sea.
My forces are growing, and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together.
Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be going outside to make war.
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money.
Lepidus flatters both of them, as they flatter him, but he doesn’t love them, and they don’t love him.
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation.
They have a massive army.
Where did you hear this?
It’s not true.
From Silvius, sir.
He’s dreaming.
I know they’re in Rome together, hoping for Antony to return.
Lecherous Cleopatra, may all the charms of love soften those withered lips!
Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let Antony’s lust combine with both.
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery.
Keep his brain drunk and his appetite unsatisfied, so that sleeping and eating make him drowsy and forgetful of his duties, like the  What’s the news, Varrius?
This news is absolutely true: Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now.
In the time since he left Egypt, he could have traveled an even longer distance.
I would have listened to less important news with greater enthusiasm.
Menas, I had no idea this amorous glutton would have put on his helmet for such an insignificant war.
His military ability is double that of the other two.
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow. 
I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion.
Antony’s dead wife raised an army against him, as did his brother, though I don’t think Antony instigated it.
Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones.
If it weren’t for the fact that we oppose all three of them together, they’d be fighting each other.
They certainly have enough provocation.
But it’s possible the fear of us may mend their petty differences, though how that will work out, we cannot say.
It will be as the gods see fit.
In any case, our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible.
Let’s go, Menas.
Good Enobarbus, you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly.
I will advise him to speak as he usually does.
If Caesar makes him mad, let Antony stand tall and speak as loudly as Mars, the god of war.
By Jupiter, if I were Antony, I wouldn’t shave my beard today.
I’d leave it long and dare Caesar to insult me by pulling on it, just so I could fight him.
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances.
It’s always appropriate to deal with matters as they arise.
But major issues must come before minor ones.
Not if the minor ones come up first.
You speak out of passion, but I beg you not to stir things up.
Here comes the noble Antony.
And there comes Caesar.    
You’re right.
If we were in front of our armies, about to fight, I would do this.
Welcome to Rome.
Thank you.
Have a seat.
After you.
No, after you.
I hear you’ve interpreted some of my actions as being improper, when they weren’t improper at all—or if they were, their impropriety didn’t concern you.
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily—and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully, when I had no reason to speak of you at all. 
Caesar, what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you?
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt.
But if you conspired against my position while you were there, I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt.
How do you mean, “conspired”?
You can judge for yourself what I mean.
Your wife and brother led troops against me, claiming to be fighting in your name.
They said they were acting for you.
You’re mistaken.
My brother didn’t use my name to justify his rebellion.
I talked to some reliable participants in that battle.
On the contrary, his fight was with both of us.
He rejected my authority as much as yours.
Since you and I share a common cause, wouldn’t his actions against you be hostile to me as well?
I’ve already sent the proof in my letters.
If you want to pick a fight, you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse.
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment, but you’re just making up feeble excuses. 
Not true, not true.
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause.
As for my wife, if only you had such a wife.
It’s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that.
We should all have wives like that.
Then the women could go to war with the men.
I had no control over her uprisings, Caesar, which arose from her impatience—and were shrewdly undertaken, as well.
I’m sorry she caused you so much trouble.
But you can’t blame me for her offenses.
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria.
You put my letters in your pocket without reading them and then mocked my messenger out of the room.
Sir, he burst into the room without invitation, just after I had come from an important banquet with three kings.
I was not myself, as a result of the wine.
The next day I explained all this to him, which was as good as begging his pardon.
Let’s not fight over this fellow.
If we must argue, let us remove him from our arguments. 
Meet with the ambassadors.
Shame on you, stubborn Queen!
Everything you do is attractive—scolding, laughing, crying—every emotion seems admirable when you express it.
I won’t see any messengers but yours.
Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people.
Come, my Queen.
That’s what you wanted to do last night.
Does Antony have so little respect for Caesar?
Sir, sometimes he’s like a different person, a person who can’t measure up to the former Antony. 
You’ve broken the terms of our sworn agreement.
You will never be able to say the same about me.
Easy, Caesar.
No, Lepidus, let him say what’s on his mind.
Now he slanders my honor, which is sacred to me.
Go on, Caesar.
What part of the agreement did I break?
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them.
You refused me both.
I overlooked your request, but I did not deny it.
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions.
I will apologize as much as is appropriate, but my apology will not diminish my great stature—or if I am denied that honor, I will withhold my military might.
The truth is that to get me out of Egypt, Fulvia provoked riots here.
And though I am only indirectly the cause of all this trouble, I ask your pardon to the extent that my honor permits me to lower myself in such a situation.
Spoken like a gentleman.
If it’s okay with you, you should not press your grievances any further, but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you.
Well put, Maecenas.
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished.
You can argue as much as you like when there’s nothing else to do.
You are only a soldier.
Be quiet.
Oh, I’d forgotten that no one’s supposed to speak the truth.
It’s not appropriate for a soldier to be part of a discussion among noblemen.
Don’t speak any further.
As you please.
I’ll pretend to be a conscious stone, and think without speaking.
I agree with what he says, though I don’t care for the way he says it.
It’s not possible for us to be friends anymore.
We’re too different, in both our dispositions and actions.
But if there were something that could join us together again, I would go to the ends of the world to find it.
May I speak, Caesar.
What is it, Agrippa?
You have a beautiful half-sister, Octavia.
Great Mark Antony is a widower now.
You’d better not make that suggestion, Agrippa.
If Cleopatra heard you, you would be well punished for your audacity.
It’s true I’m not married, Caesar.
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say.
If Antony were to take Octavia as his wife, you two would be bound in eternal friendship.
As brothers, your hearts would be tied together in an unbreakable knot.
She is beautiful enough for the best of men.
Her virtue and grace are unparalleled.
With this marriage, all the petty jealousies that now seem huge, and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves, would disappear.
People would become used to speaking the truth rather than gossip.
Since she would love both of you, you two would be joined in that love.
Excuse my bluntness.
This is not a spur-of-the-moment suggestion.
I have been considering this for some time, in my duties to both of you.
What do you say, Caesar?
I’d rather hear your reaction to this first.
If I said to Agrippa, “I agree.
Make it happen,” does Agrippa have the power to make it so? 
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia.
I wouldn’t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea.
Let’s shake on it.
If you go through with this plan, from now on we’ll be brothers, and our love for one another will guide our actions.
Here’s my hand.
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister.
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts.
We’ll never fight again.
I’m happy to say “amen” to that!
I didn’t think I would ever fight Pompey.
He’s shown me unusual deference lately, and I must repay his favors or risk a reputation for ingratitude.
That done, I can turn against him.
There isn’t much time.
Either we go after Pompey or he’ll come after us. 
Where is he now?
Near  How large is his land army?
Large and increasing.
But his navy rules the sea.
That’s what I hear.
I wish we’d had this conversation sooner.
Let’s get down to business—and yet, before we get ready for war, let’s take care of that business we just discussed.
With pleasure.
I’ll introduce you to my sister.
Follow me.
Come with us, Lepidus.
Noble Antony, even illness couldn’t keep me away.
You’ve become Caesar’s right hand man, Maecenas!
It’s good to see you too, Agrippa.
Good Enobarbus!
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably.
And I see you survived your time in Egypt.
Yes, sir, it was tough.
We confused the daytime by sleeping through it, and made the night merry with our drinking.
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast—for only twelve people!
Is that true?
That was nothing.
There were many even more memorable feasts.
She’s a remarkable lady, if the rumors are to be believed.
From the first time Antony saw her, sailing on her barge on the  She made quite an appearance there, or else my informant invented a very flattering description of her.
I’ll tell you.
Her barge looked like a golden throne upon the waves, burning bright with the sun’s reflections.
The rear deck was covered with hammered gold.
The sails were dyed purple, and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love.
The oars were made of silver, and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music.
As the oars beat the water, the waves seemed to speed up as if excited by lust.
Cleopatra’s appearance was indescribable.
As she reclined under a canopy woven from gold thread, she was more beautiful than any artist’s idealized portrait of the goddess Venus.
Pretty, Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her, smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans, which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them, undoing what they did.
How excellent for Antony!
Her ladies-in-waiting—like  Extraordinary Egyptian!
When she landed at the port, Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper.
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead.
Our courteous Antony, who has never said “no” to any woman, after spending plenty of time being groomed by the barber, goes to the feast.
For that simple meal, he paid with his heart—even though it was only his eyes that were satisfied.
Royal seductress!
She lured Julius Caesar into her bed, he made love to her, and she bore  I saw her once hop forty feet down the street.
When she stopped she was so out of breath that she was panting.
Her beauty made even that weakness seem perfect, and even in her breathlessness she seemed to pour out breath.
Now Antony has to leave her completely.
He’ll never leave her.
Age won’t wither her, and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring.
With other women, the more familiar you grow with them the less appealing they become.
Cleopatra, on the other hand, makes you desire her the more you see her.
Even her worst faults are charming, and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut.
If beauty, wisdom, and modesty can settle Antony’s restless heart, Octavia will be the best thing that has ever happened to him.
Let’s go.
Good Enobarbus, consider yourself my guest as long as you’re here.
I humbly thank you.

And I will spend our time apart on my knees, praying for you.
Good night.
Now,  I wish I had never left Egypt and that you had never come to Egypt.
Tell me why, if you can.
It’s a feeling, but nothing I can put into words.
But you had better get back to Egypt again.
Tell me who shall have the better luck, Caesar or me?
Caesar.
So you’d better not stay with him, Antony.
Your guardian angel is noble, courageous, significant, and unmatched when Caesar’s not around.
But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and easily frightened.
That’s why there must be space between you. 
I’m sad to say this confirms the stories being told about him in Rome, which I had taken to be lies.
Well, I’ll hope things change for the better soon.
Have a good night!
Don’t speak of this again.
To none but you, only to you.
You will surely lose any game you play with Caesar.
With his natural luck, he will beat you even against the odds.
Your light dulls when he is near.
I repeat: your angel is afraid to inspire you when you’re around him, but when he goes away it becomes brilliant again.
Leave now.
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him.
Come here, Ventidius.
You must go to Parthia.
Your authorization is ready.
Come with me and I’ll get it for you.

Don’t spend any more time here.
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations.
Sir, we’ll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye.
Good-bye then, until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear, which will suit you both very well.
According to my reckoning, we’ll get to Mt.
Misena before you, Lepidus.
You’re taking a shorter route.
My plans take me a roundabout way.
You’ll get there two days before me.
Good luck, sir.
Farewell.
Play me some music.
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers.
Musicians, come in!
Never mind.
Let’s play billiards.
Play with me, Charmian.
My arm is sore.
You’ll have a better game with Mardian.
Playing with a eunuch is the same as playing with a woman.
Will you play with me, sir?
I’ll do my best, madam.
When a person tries in good faith, even if he fails he cannot be blamed.
I don’t want to play now.
Give me my fishing rod.
We’ll go to the river.
With my music playing in the background, I’ll lure fish.
My hook will go through their slimy jaws and as I pull them up I’ll imagine each one is Antony.
I’ll say, “Aha!
I caught you!” It was funny when you and Antony bet on who could catch the first fish.
You had a diver put a salted fish on his hook.
He was so excited as he hurried to pull it in!
That time?
Oh, there were so many fun times.
I would play some trick on him and laugh until he lost his patience.
Then, that night, I would laugh with him while we made love until he was patient again.
Then by nine in the morning I would have him so drunk I could dress him in my clothes while I wore the sword he used at the famous battle of Philippi.
Oh!
News from Italy!
Cram your good news into my ears.
It’s been so long since I’ve heard from him.
Madam, madam— Antony’s dead!
If you say that, you bastard, you’ll kill your Queen.
If you say he’s healthy and free, I’ll give you money and you may kiss my hand.
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand.
Let me say first, madam, that he is well.
Well then, here’s more money for you.
But you know, sirrah, we customarily say that the dead are well.
If that’s what you mean, I’ll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words.
Good madam, let me speak.
All right, I will.
But you don’t look as if you bring good news.
If Antony is free and healthy, you shouldn’t wear such a sour face while bringing such good news.
If he’s not well, you should arrive like a  Do you want to hear my news?
