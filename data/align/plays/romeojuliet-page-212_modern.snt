I have time for you now, my sad daughter.
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion!
Juliet, I will wake you early on Thursday Oh, shut the door, and after you shut it, come over here and weep with me.
This mess is beyond hope, beyond cure, beyond help!
Oh, Juliet, I already know about your sad situation.
It’s a problem too hard for me to solve.
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday, and that nothing can delay it.
Don’t tell me that you’ve heard about this marriage, Friar, unless you can tell me how to prevent it.
If you who are so wise can’t help, please be kind enough to call my solution wise.
