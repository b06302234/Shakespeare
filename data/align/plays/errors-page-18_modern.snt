I have some marks from you on my head and some of my mistress’s marks on my body.
But between the both of you, I don’t have a thousand marks.
If I gave those marks back to you, chances are you wouldn’t take them as patiently as I did.
Your mistress’s marks?
What mistress do you have?
Your wife, sir.
My mistress.
At the Phoenix.
The one who’s waiting for you to come home for lunch and praying that you’ll get home quickly.
What, are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to?
There, take that, you scoundrel!
What are you doing?
Stop, for God’s sake!
Well, if you don’t, then I’m out of here.
I swear, somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money.
They say that this town is full of deception—illusionists that can fool the eye, dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind, soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body, disguised swindlers, fast-talking fakers, and all kinds of other unchecked sins.
If this is true, then I’ll be leaving all the sooner.
I’ll go to the Centaur to find this servant of mine—I fear that my money isn’t safe.
