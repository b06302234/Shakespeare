Trouble yourselves no further.
Pray you, hasten Your generals after.
Sir, Mark Antony Will e’en but kiss Octavia, and we’ll follow.
Till I shall see you in your soldiers’ dress, Which will become you both, farewell.
We shall, As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount Before you, Lepidus.
Your way is shorter.
My purposes do draw me much about.
You’ll win two days upon me.
Sir, good success.
Farewell.
