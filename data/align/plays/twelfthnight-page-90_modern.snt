My friend, sing us the song you sang last night.—Listen to it carefully, Cesario, it’s a simple old song.
Spinners and knitters used to sing it while they sewed, and maidens used to sing it over their weaving.
It tells the simple truth about innocent love, as it was in the good old days.
Are you ready, sir?
Yes.
Please, sing.
