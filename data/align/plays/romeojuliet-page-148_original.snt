Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence.
This shall determine that.
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed.
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken.
Hence, be gone, away!
Oh, I am fortune’s fool!
Why dost thou stay?
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
There lies that Tybalt.
I charge thee in the Prince’s name, obey.
