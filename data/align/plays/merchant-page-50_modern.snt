But excuse me,  Yes, I’m talking about Launcelot, sir.
Oh, no.
God forbid!
The boy was going to support me in my old age!
What am I, a cane?
How could I support anyone?
Don’t you recognize me, father?
Heaven help me, I don’t know you, sir.
But please tell me, is my boy—God rest his soul—alive or dead?
You really don’t recognize me, father?
Sir, I’m half-blind.
I don’t know you.
Even if you had your eyes, you still might not recognize me.
It takes a wise father to know his own child.
Well, old man, I’ll tell you news of your son.
Give me your blessing.
The truth will come to light, and murder can’t be hidden long—a man’s son may hide, but truth will always come out.
