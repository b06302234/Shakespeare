Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
Nay, he’s at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness.
Say, didst thou speak with him?
Know’st thou his mind?
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning?
Nay, he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows, and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them.
But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn mad.
Horn mad, thou villain!
I mean not cuckold mad, But sure he is stark mad.
When I desired him to come home to dinner, He asked me for a thousand marks in gold.
Tis dinnertime,” quoth I.
My gold,” quoth he.
