Not in my house, Lucentio.
My servants might overhear, and old Gremio is still hanging around, so we might be interrupted.
This is all very acceptable.—Cambio, hurry home and tell Bianca to get ready right away and, if you don’t mind, tell her what’s happened: that Lucentio’s father has arrived in Padua, and that she’s likely to become Lucentio’s wife.
I hope with all my heart she will!
