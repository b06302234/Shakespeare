Well, you may fear too far.
Safer than trust too far.
Let me still take away the harms I fear, Not fear still to be taken.
I know his heart.
What he hath uttered I have writ my sister.
If she sustain him and his hundred knights When I have showed th' unfitness— Here, madam.

What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
Ay, madam.
Take you some company, and away to horse.
Inform her full of my particular fear, And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more.
Get you gone And hasten your return.
No, no, my lord, Though I condemn not, yet under pardon You are much more attasked for want of wisdom Than praised for harmful mildness.
How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.
Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well.
