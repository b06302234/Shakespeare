Seem,” mother?
No, it  Hamlet, you are so sweet and such a good son to mourn your father like this.
But you have to remember, that your father lost his father, who lost his father before him, and every time, each son has had to mourn his father for a certain period.
But overdoing it is just stubborn.
It’s not manly.
It’s not what God wants, and it betrays a vulnerable heart and an ignorant and weak mind.
Since we know that everyone must die sooner or later, why should we take it to heart?
You’re committing a crime against heaven, against the dead, and against nature.
And it’s irration-al, since the truth is that all fathers must die.
Please give up this useless mourning of yours and start thinking of me as your new father.
