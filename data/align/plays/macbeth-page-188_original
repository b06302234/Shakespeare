Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there?
Well, march we on, To give obedience where ’tis truly owed.
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal, And with him pour we in our country’s purge Each drop of us.
Or so much as it needs, To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Make we our march towards Birnam.
