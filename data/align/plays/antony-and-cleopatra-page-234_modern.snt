Ha, ha, ha!
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that!
Those tears will bring blessings to you.
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense, my hearty friends.
I spoke to encourage you, asking that you help me make this night a brilliant one.
You should know, my friends, that I have good hopes for tomorrow, and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death.
Let’s go to supper.
Come, and let’s drown our worries.
