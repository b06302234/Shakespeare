Who intercepts my expedition?
O, she that might have intercepted thee, By strangling thee in her accursèd womb, From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done.
Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded, if that right were right, The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet his son?
Where is gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
Where is kind Hastings?
A flourish, trumpets!
Strike alarum, drums!
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed.
Strike, I say!
Either be patient and entreat me fair, Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations.
Art thou my son?
