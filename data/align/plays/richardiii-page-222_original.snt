The king?
Who’s that?
I mean, the Lord Protector.
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
I am their mother.
Who shall bar me from them?
I am their father’s mother.
I will see them.
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
Then bring me to their sights.
I’ll bear thy blame And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
No, madam, no.
I may not leave it so.
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence, And I’ll salute your Grace of York as mother And reverend looker-on, of two fair queens.
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster, There to be crownèd Richard’s royal queen.
Ah, cut my lace asunder, That my pent heart may have some scope to beat, Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!
Despiteful tidings!
O, unpleasing news!
your Grace?
