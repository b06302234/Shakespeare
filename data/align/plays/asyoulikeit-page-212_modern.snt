Actually, it’s my arm.
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion’s claws.
My heart  Did your brother tell you how well I pretended to faint when he showed me the handkerchief?
Yes, and he told me some things that were even more amazing.
Oh, I know what you’re talking about.
It’s true: it was as sudden as two rams rushing at each other, and as quick as Julius Caesar’s “I came, I saw, I conquered.” Your brother and my sister had no sooner met than they gave each other a good once over; they had no sooner looked at each other than they fell in love; no sooner fell in love than they sighed; no sooner sighed than they asked each other why they had sighed; no sooner answered than they sought a solution.
And in this way, degree by degree, they’ve built a staircase toward marriage.
And they had better climb those stairs immediately, or else they’ll end up in bed before they ought to.
They’re in the heat of passion; they simply have to be together.
You couldn’t beat the two of them apart.
They’ll be married tomorrow, and I’ll invite the duke to the ceremony.
But, oh, it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man’s eyes.
Tomorrow I’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved, in having what he wished for.
