He’s just as terrified of Sir Andrew.
He’s pale and hyperventilating, as if a bear were chasing him.
Back off if he seems really furious.
Come on, Sir Andrew, there’s nothing you can do about it.
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you, for the sake of his honor.
The rules of dueling say he has to.
But as a gentleman and a soldier he’s promised me he won’t hurt you.
Come on, get ready.
I hope to God he keeps his promise!
I swear to you, I don’t want to be doing this.
Put your sword away.
If this young gentleman has offended you, I’ll take the blame for it.
If you’ve offended him, I’ll fight you.
