I do attend here on the general And think it no addition, nor my wish, To have him see me womaned.
Why, I pray you?
Not that I love you not.
But that you do not love me.
I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night.
Tis but a little way that I can bring you, For I attend here.
But Iâ€™ll see you soon.
Tis very good.
I must be circumstanced.
