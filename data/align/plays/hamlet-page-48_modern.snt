Father, he’s always talked about love in an honorable fashion— Yes, “fashion” is just the word—a passing whim.
Go on.
And he’s made the holiest vows to me, to back up what he says.
These vows are just traps for stupid birds.
I know when a man is on fire, he’ll swear anything.
But when a heart’s on fire, it gives out more light than heat, and the fire will be out even before he’s done making his promises.
Don’t mistake that for true love.
From now on, spend a little less time with him and talk to him less.
Make yourself a precious commodity.
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do.
In short, Ophelia, don’t believe his love vows, since they’re like flashy pimps who wear nice clothes to lead a woman into filthy acts.
To put it plainly, don’t waste your time with Hamlet.
Do as I say.
Now come along.
I’ll do as you say, father.
