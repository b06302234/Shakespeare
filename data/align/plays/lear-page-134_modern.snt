person when you’re ready, if you’re inclined.
I’ll wait patiently.
Meanwhile I’ll stay with Regan with my hundred knights.
It’s not quite that simple.
I wasn’t expecting you, and I’m not ready to receive you.
Please hear what Goneril is saying.
We’re trying to be reasonable while you’re so upset, and we understand that you’re old, and… But Goneril knows what she’s doing.
Do you mean what you’ve just said?
Yes, I do.
Isn’t fifty knights enough for you?
Why would you need more than that?
Or even that many.
Fifty knights are expensive to maintain, and there’s always a risk they’ll rebel.
How could so many people, under two masters, get along under one roof?
It would be hard, almost impossible.
Why couldn’t you be attended by my servants, or by Regan’s?
Yes, why not, my lord?
Then if they’re negligent, we could control them.
Now that I think about the danger of these knights, if you come to stay with me, please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you.
I won’t lodge any more than that under my roof.
I gave you everything— And it was about time too.
