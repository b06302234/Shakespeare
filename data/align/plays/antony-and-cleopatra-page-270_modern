They’ve switched their operation to the sea today.
We didn’t please them on land.
We’re ready for both, my lord.
I wish they’d fight in fire or in the air.
We’d meet them there too.
But here’s the plan: our army will stay with us on the hills by the city.
Orders have been given to the navy and they’ve left port.
We’ll be able to analyze and direct the battle better from the hills.
