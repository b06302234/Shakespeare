I was not angry since I came to France until this instant.
Take a trumpet, herald.
Ride out to the horsemen on that hill.
If they seek battle with us, have them come down or else clear the field.
The sight of them is offensive.
If they’ll do neither, we’ll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings.
We’ll also cut the throats of any prisoners we have.
Not a man of them that we shall take shall know our mercy.
Go and tell them this.
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
He looks humbler than he used to.
Well?
What is the meaning of this, herald?
Don’t you know that I have offered these bones of mine for ransom?
Are you coming again for ransom?
No, great king.
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them, separating our nobles from the common men, for many of our princes—alas!—lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers.
Likewise, our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes, and their wounded steeds, ankle-deep in gore, struggle and, raging wildly, stamp on their dead masters with their hooves, killing them a second time.
Oh, give us permission, great king, to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies.
