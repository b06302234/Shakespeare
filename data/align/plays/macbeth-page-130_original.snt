Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.
Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined.
Harpier cries, “'Tis time, ’tis time.” Round about the cauldron go, In the poisoned entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone Days and nights has thirty-one Sweltered venom sleeping got, Boil thou first i' th' charmèd pot.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
Fillet of a fenny snake, In the cauldron boil and bake.
Eye of newt and toe of frog, Wool of bat and tongue of dog, Adder’s fork and blind-worm’s sting, Lizard’s leg and owlet’s wing, For a charm of powerful trouble, Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
