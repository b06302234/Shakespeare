Everything’s OK.
I had a dream last night about the three witches.
At least part of what they said about you was true.
I don’t think about them now.
But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it, if you’re willing.
Whenever you like.
If you stick with me, when the time comes, there will be something in it for you.
I’ll do whatever you say, as long as I can do it with a clear conscience.
Rest easy in the meantime.
Thank you, sir.
You do the same.
Is this a dagger I see in front of me, with its handle pointing toward my hand?
