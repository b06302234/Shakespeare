We’ve been looking for him everywhere.
Here comes another Jew.
You couldn’t find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew.
Hello, Tubal.
Any news from Genoa?
Did you find my daughter?
I went to many places where I heard news about her, but I couldn’t find her.
Oh, oh, oh!
One of the stolen diamonds cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt!
I never felt the curse of the Jews until now.
I never felt it until now—two thousand ducats in that diamond, and other precious, precious jewels!
I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels!
I wish she were in her coffin here, with the ducats in her coffin!
You couldn’t find out anything about them?
Why?
I don’t even know how much I’m spending to find them.
Loss upon loss!
The thief left with so much, and I’m spending so much to hunt down the thief—and still I’m not satisfied!
I haven’t gotten my revenge.
The only luck I have is bad luck.
Nobody suffers but me.
Nobody’s crying except me.
