Stop.
Pass on the command to halt!
What’s happening now, Lucillius?
Is Cassius nearby?
He’s nearby, and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master.
He sends his greetings through a good man.
Your master, Pindarus, either because he’s changed his mind or been influenced by bad officers, has made me wish we hadn’t done some of the things we did.
If he’s nearby, I want an explanation.
I have no doubt that my noble master will prove himself to be what he is: honorable and noble.
I don’t doubt him.
Can I have a word with you, Lucillius?
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect, but not with affection, nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me.
You’ve described a warm friend who’s cooling off.
Remember this, Lucillius.
When a friend starts to get sick of you, he treats you artificially.
Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony.
But insincere men, like horses who are too lively at the start of a race, make a big show of their spirit.
