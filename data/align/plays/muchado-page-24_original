To the tuition of God.
From my house, if I had it— The sixth of July.
Your loving friend, Benedick.
Nay, mock not, mock not.
The body of your discourse is sometimes guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither.
Ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience.
And so I leave you.
My liege, your highness now may do me good.
My love is thine to teach.
Teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
No child but Hero; she’s his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
O, my lord, When you went onward on this ended action, I looked upon her with a soldier’s eye, That liked but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love.
But now I am returned and that war thoughts Have left their places vacant, in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires, All prompting me how fair young Hero is, Saying I liked her ere I went to wars.
