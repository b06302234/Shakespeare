My lord, his throat is cut.
That I did for him.
Thou art the best o' th' cutthroats: Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance.
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.
Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scaped.
Then comes my fit again.
I had else been perfect, Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air.
But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in To saucy doubts and fears.—But Banquo’s safe?
Ay, my good lord.
Safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenchèd gashes on his head, The least a death to nature.
Thanks for that.
There the grown serpent lies.
The worm that’s fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed; No teeth for th' present.
Get thee gone.
Tomorrow We’ll hear ourselves again.
My royal lord, You do not give the cheer.
The feast is sold That is not often vouched, while ’tis a-making, 'Tis given with welcome.
To feed were best at home; From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it.
