Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air, and let rich musicâ€™s tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter.

They are but beggars that can count their worth.
But my true love is grown to such excess I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
Come, come with me, and we will make short work.
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till holy church incorporate two in one.
