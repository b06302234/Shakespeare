For Antony, I have no ears to his request.
The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she From Egypt drive her all-disgracèd friend Or take his life there.
This if she perform, She shall not sue unheard.
So to them both.
Fortune pursue thee!
Bring him through the bands.
From Antony win Cleopatra.
Promise, And in our name, what she requires.
Add more, From thine invention, offers.
Women are not In their best fortunes strong, but want will perjure The ne’er-touched vestal.
Try thy cunning, Thidias.
Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we Will answer as a law.
Caesar, I go.
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw, And what thou think’st his very action speaks In every power that moves.
Caesar, I shall.
