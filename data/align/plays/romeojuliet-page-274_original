Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.— What’s here?
A cup, closed in my true love’s hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.— O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after?
I will kiss thy lips.
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative.
Thy lips are warm.
Yea, noise?
Then I’ll be brief.
O happy dagger, This is thy sheath.
There rust and let me die.
This is the place.
There, where the torch doth burn.
The ground is bloody.—Search about the churchyard.
Go, some of you.
Whoe'er you find, attach.
Pitiful sight!
Here lies the county slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm and newly dead, Who here hath lain these two days buried.— Go, tell the Prince.
Run to the Capulets.
Raise up the Montagues.
Some others search.
