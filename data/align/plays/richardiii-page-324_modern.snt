Give me another horse!
Bandage my wounds!
Have mercy, Jesus!—Wait, I was only dreaming.
Oh cowardly conscience, how you’re torturing me!
The candles burn blue—that means it’s the dead of night.
I’m sweating and trembling with fear.
But what am I afraid of?
Myself?
There’s no one else here.
Richard loves Richard, that is, there’s just me and myself here.
Is there a murderer here?
No.
Yes, I am.
Then run away.
What, from myself?
Yes, to avoid taking revenge on myself.
Unfortunately, I love myself.
Why?
Did I do anything good to myself?
Oh, no.
Alas, I hate myself instead, because of the hateful deeds I’ve committed.
I am a villain.
But I’m lying; I’m not a villain.
Fool, speak well of yourself.
Fool, do not flatter yourself.
My lord.
Damn it, who’s there?
Ratcliffe, my lord, it’s me.
The rooster has already crowed twice.
Your friends are up and buckling on their armor.
Oh Ratcliffe, I had a terrifying dream!
What do you think, will my friends prove loyal?
No doubt, my lord.
Oh Ratcliffe, I’m afraid, I’m afraid— No, my good lord, don’t be afraid of dreams.
