Are we all met?
Pat, pat.
And here’s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal.
This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house, and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
Peter Quince— What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please.
First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot abide.
How answer you that?
By 'r lakin, a parlous fear.
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
Not a whit.
I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed.
And for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver.
This will put them out of fear.
