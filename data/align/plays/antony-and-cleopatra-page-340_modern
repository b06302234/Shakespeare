What’s that noise?
There’s a farmer here who won’t leave without seeing your Highness.
He has brought you figs.
Let him come in.
What a poor instrument, that can do such a noble deed!
He brings me freedom.
My mind is made up.
There’s nothing of the weak woman left in me.
Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble.
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me.
This is the man.
Leave us.
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain?
I certainly do have him, but I wouldn’t advise you to touch him.
His bite is fatal.
People who die of it seldom or never recover.
