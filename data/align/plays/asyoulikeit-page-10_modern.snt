Good morning, sir.
Good Mr. Charles!
Tell me, what’s the latest news at the new court?
No news but the old news: the old Duke Senior has been banished by his younger brother, the new Duke Frederick.
A few loyal lords have gone into exile with Duke Senior, and given up their lands and money to Frederick—so he’s happy enough to have them leave.
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished?
Oh, no.
Duke Frederick’s daughter, Celia, grew up with Rosalind, and Celia loves her cousin so much that she would have either followed her into exile or died of grief.
Rosalind has stayed at court, where Duke Frederick loves her like his own daughter.
No two women ever loved each other like they do.
Where will the old duke live?
They say he’s already in the Forest of Arden.
He has many cheerful men with him, and they live like Robin Hood and his outlaws.
People say that new batches of young men flock there every day, and that they all pass the time without a care, like people did in the  So, are you going to wrestle before the new duke tomorrow?
