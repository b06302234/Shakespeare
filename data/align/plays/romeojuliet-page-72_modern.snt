Now Romeo’s old feelings of desire are dying, and a new desire is eager to take their place.
Romeo groaned for the beautiful Rosaline and said he would die for her, but compared with tender Juliet, Rosaline doesn’t seem beautiful now.
Now someone loves Romeo, and he’s in love again—both of them falling for each others' good looks.
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy.
And she’s been hooked by someone she should fear.
Because he’s an enemy, Romeo has no chance to see Juliet and say the things a lover normally says.
And Juliet’s just as much in love as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover.
But love gives them power, and time gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure.
