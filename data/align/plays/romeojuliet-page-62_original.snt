This, by his voice, should be a Montague.â€”   What, dares the slave Come hither, covered with an antic face, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honor of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
Why, how now, kinsman?
Wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night.
Young Romeo is it?
Tis he, that villain Romeo.
Content thee, gentle coz.
Let him alone.
He bears him like a portly gentleman, And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement.
Therefore be patient.
Take no note of him.
It is my will, the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
