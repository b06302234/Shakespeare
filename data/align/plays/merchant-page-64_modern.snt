I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this.
It’s hell in our house, and you helped cheer it up, like a funny devil.
But goodbye.
Here’s a ducat for you.
You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper; he’ll be a guest of your new master.
Give him this letter.
Goodbye.
My tears show you my feelings, my beautiful pagan, my sweet Jew!
I’m sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you.
But goodbye.
It’s not manly to cry.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Launcelot.
Oh God, what a heinous sinner I am, being ashamed to be my father’s child!
But I need to remember I’m related to him by blood, not behavior.
Oh Lorenzo, if you keep your promise to me, I’ll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you.
