Go hence.
Good night.
And here stands all your state: Either be gone before the watch be set, Or by the break of day disguised from hence.
Sojourn in Mantua.
Iâ€™ll find out your man, And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here.
Give me thy hand.
Tis late.
Farewell, good night.
But that a joy past joy calls out on me, It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
Farewell.
