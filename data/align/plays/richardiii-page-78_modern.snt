Clarence has arrived—lying, cowardly  I’m not surprised it scared you, my lord.
It scares me just to hear you talk about it.
Oh, keeper, keeper, the bad things I’ve done are finally taking their toll.
I did them for Edward’s sake—and look how he rewards me.—Oh God, if my prayers don’t satisfy you, and you have to avenge the wrongs I’ve done, at least punish me alone!
Please spare my innocent wife and children!—Kind warden, please stay with me for a while.
I’m feeling very low, and I need to sleep.
I’ll stay, my lord.
May God bring you sleep!
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons.
It turns everything around—the night into morning and noon into night.
The only glory princes have are their titles.
