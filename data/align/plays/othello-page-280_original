Yes, ’tis Emilia.— 'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death, The noise was high.
Ha!
No more moving?
Still as the grave.
Shall she come in?
Were ’t good?
I think she stirs again—No.
What’s best to do?
If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife— My wife!
my wife!
what wife?
I have no wife.
Oh, insupportable!
Oh, heavy hour!
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse Of sun and moon, and that th' affrighted globe Should yawn at alteration.
I do beseech you That I may speak with you, O good my lord!
I had forgot thee—Oh, come in, Emilia.
Soft, by and by.
Let me the curtains draw.
Where art thou?
What’s the matter with thee now?
O my good lord, yonder’s foul murders done!
What, now?
But now, my lord.
It is the very error of the moon, She comes more nearer earth than she was wont And makes men mad.
Cassio, my lord, hath killed a young Venetian Called Roderigo.
