Time’s not the one in debt.
Your logic is so foolish.
Time is always bankrupt: it owes more than it can ever pay back in a season.
And Time’s a thief, too—don’t you know the old saying, “Time steals along”?
So if Time is in debt and also a thief, and a cop comes, don’t you think Time would turn back an hour?
Here’s the money, Dromio.
Take it to your master and bring him home immediately.
Come, sister, my imagination is too much for me: it both comforts me and depresses me.
