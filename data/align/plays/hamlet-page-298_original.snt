Hear you, sir.
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved you ever.
But it is no matter.
Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
We’ll put the matter to the present push.— Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.— This grave shall have a living monument.
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see.
Till then in patience our proceeding be.
