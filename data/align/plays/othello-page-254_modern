Here, stand behind this wall; he’ll come right away.
Keep your sword out, and then stick it in as far as it’ll go.
Quick, quick.
Don’t be afraid.
I’ll be right next to you.
This will either make us or break us.
Keep that in mind, and be steady.
Stay right near me.
I may mess it up.
I’m right behind you.
Be bold, and get ready.
I don’t really want to do this, but he’s given me good reasons.
I guess it’s only one man—no big deal.
My sword comes out, and he dies.
