I’m only trying to keep the peace.
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight.
What?
You take out your sword and then talk about peace?
I hate the word peace like I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.
Let’s go at it, coward!
Use your clubs and spears!
Hit them!
Beat them down!
Down with the Capulets!
Down with the Montagues!
What’s this noise?
Give me my long sword!
Come on!
A crutch, you need a crutch—why are you asking for a sword?
I want my sword.
Old Montague is here, and he’s waving his sword around just to make me mad.
Capulet, you villain!
You’re not taking one step toward an enemy.
