It would be a terrible event no matter where it happened.
Dear Macduff, I beg you, tell us you were lying and say it isn’t so.
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life.
Because from this moment on, there is nothing worth living for.
Everything is a sick joke.
The graceful and renowned king is dead.
The wine of life has been poured out, and only the dregs remain.
What’s wrong?
You are, but you don’t know it yet.
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped.
Your royal father is murdered.
Who did it?
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it.
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood.
So were their daggers, which we found on their pillows, unwiped.
They stared at us in confusion.
No one’s life should have been entrusted to them.
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them.
