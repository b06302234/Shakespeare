I have to do it, I have to do it.
I have to keep my reason in mind.
I won’t say out loud what my reason is, but I have to do it.
But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble.
But she’s got to die, or she’ll cheat on other men.
Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart.
If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it.
But once I kill you, you beautiful, fake woman, I do not know the magic that could bring you back.
When I’ve plucked this rose, I can’t make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die.
Let me smell you while you’re still on the tree.
Who’s there?
Othello?
Yes, Desdemona.
