I, sir, am Dromio.
Pray, let me stay.
You are Egeon, aren’t you?
Or are you his ghost?
Oh, my old master!—Who tied him up?
Whoever tied him up, I will loosen the ropes, and with his freedom I will gain a husband.
Tell us, old Egeon: are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia, who gave birth to two fair sons?
Oh, if you are the same Egeon, speak now, and speak to that same Emilia!
Why, now the story the merchant told me this morning is starting to make sense.
These two Antipholuses, who look so alike—and these two Dromios, who seem to have the same face—and her story of being shipwrecked—why, these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident.
If I’m not dreaming, you are Emilia.
If it’s really you, tell me what happened to our son, who floated away with you on that deadly raft.
Some men from Epidamnum rescued me, our son, and Dromio.
But then a gang of violent fishermen from Corinth kidnapped Dromio and my son and carried them away.
I don’t know what became of them.
You can see what became of me.
Antipholus, aren’t you originally from Corinth?
