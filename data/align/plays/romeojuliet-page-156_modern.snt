Oh, here comes my Nurse, and she brings news.
Every voice that mentions Romeo’s name sounds beautiful.
Now, Nurse, what’s the news?
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up?
Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder.
Oh my, what’s the news?
Why do you look so upset?
Oh, it’s a sad day!
He’s dead.
He’s dead.
He’s dead!
We’re ruined, lady, we’re ruined!
What an awful day!
He’s gone.
He’s been killed.
He’s dead!
Can God be so jealous and hateful?
Romeo is hateful, even though God isn’t.
Oh, Romeo, Romeo, who ever would have thought it would be Romeo?
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this?
This is as bad as the tortures of hell.
Has Romeo killed himself?
Just say “Yes” and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye.
I will no longer be myself if you tell me Romeo killed himself.
If he’s been killed, say “Yes.” If not, say “No.” These short words will determine my joy or my pain.
I saw the wound.
I saw it with my own eyes.
God bless that wound, here on his manly chest.
A pitiful corpse, a bloody, pitiful corpse.
Pale as ashes and drenched in blood.
All the dried blood was so gory.
I fainted when I saw it.
