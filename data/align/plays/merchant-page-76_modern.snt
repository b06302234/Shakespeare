What did that gentile fool say to you, hmmm?
He said “Goodbye, madam,” and nothing else.
The fool’s nice enough, but he’s such a huge eater, and slow as a snail when he works.
He sleeps all day like a cat.
Bees that don’t work can’t stay in my hive, so I’m letting him go, handing him off so he can waste money for his new boss, the man who borrowed money from me.
Anyway, Jessica, go inside.
I might come back soon.
Do as I told you.
Shut the doors after you.
As the saying goes, lock things up, and you’ll get to keep them.
Goodbye.
If luck’s with me, I’ll lose a father, and you’ll lose a daughter.
