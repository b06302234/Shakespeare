Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
Nay, I’ll come.
If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
I would exult, man.
You know, he brought me out o' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
To anger him, we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue.
Shall we not, Sir Andrew?
An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
Here comes the little villain.
How now, my metal of India?
Get you all three into the boxtree.
Malvolio’s coming down this walk.
He has been yonder i' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour.
Observe him, for the love of mockery, for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him.
Close, in the name of jesting!
