Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
Why call you me “love”?
Call my sister so.
Thy sister’s sister.
That’s my sister.
No, It is thyself, mine own self’s better part, Mine eye’s clear eye, my dear heart’s dearer heart, My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope’s aim, My sole earth’s heaven, and my heaven’s claim.
All this my sister is, or else should be.
Call thyself “sister,” sweet, for I am thee.
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life; Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.
Give me thy hand.
O soft, sir!
Hold you still.
I’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill.
Why, how now, Dromio.
Where runn’st thou so fast?
Do you know me, sir?
Am I Dromio?
Am I your man?
Am I myself?
