Mistress,  Wilt thou still talk?
How say you now?
Is not your husband mad?
His incivility confirms no less.— Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer; Establish him in his true sense again, And I will please you what you will demand.
Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.
Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.
There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man, To yield possession to my holy prayers And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.
Peace, doting wizard, peace.
I am not mad.
O, that thou wert not, poor distressèd soul!
You minion, you, are these your customers?
Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house?
