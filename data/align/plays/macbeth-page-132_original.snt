Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, Witches' mummy, maw and gulf Of the ravined salt-sea shark, Root of hemlock digged i' th' dark, Liver of blaspheming Jew, Gall of goat and slips of yew Slivered in the moon’s eclipse, Nose of Turk and Tartar’s lips, Finger of birth-strangled babe Ditch-delivered by a drab, Make the gruel thick and slab.
Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron, For the ingredients of our cauldron.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Cool it with a baboon’s blood, Then the charm is firm and good.
Oh well done!
I commend your pains, And every one shall share i' th' gains.
And now about the cauldron sing, Like elves and fairies in a ring, Enchanting all that you put in.
By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks, Whoever knocks.
