I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous, And will upon the instant put thee to ’t.
Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio’s not alive.
My friend is dead, 'Tis done at your request.
But let her live.
Damn her, lewd minx!
Oh, damn her, damn her!
Come, go with me apart.
I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil.
Now art thou my lieutenant.
I am your own for ever.
