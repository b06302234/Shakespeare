Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans, Mistlike, infold me from the search of eyes.
Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise.
Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.
Run to my study.—By and by!—God’s will, What simpleness is this!—I come, I come.
Who knocks so hard?
Whence come you?
What’s your will?
I come from Lady Juliet.
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar, Where is my lady’s lord?
Where’s Romeo?
