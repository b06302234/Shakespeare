Oh, oh, Edmund, I don’t like this monstrous business.
When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm, they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him, lobby for him, or support him in any way.
That’s uncivilized and unnatural!
Oh, be quiet.
There’s a feud between the two dukes.
And there’s something even worse than that.
I got a letter tonight.
It’s dangerous to talk about it.
I’ve locked it up in my room.
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly.
Armed forces have already landed.
We have to take the king’s side.
I’ll look for him and secretly help him.
You go and talk to the duke so he won’t notice I’m helping the king.
If he asks to see me, tell him I’m sick and went to bed.
Even if I have to die—as they threaten—I have to help the king.
Strange things are about to happen, Edmund.
Please be careful.
I’ll tell the duke right away that you’re going to see the king, which is forbidden.
And I’ll tell him about the letter too.
You’ll get what you deserve, and I’ll be rewarded with everything you lose—in other words, all your lands.
The young generation rises while the old one falls.
