Good luck.
I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances.
I hope you get what you desire!
Come on, where’s the young  Ready, sir, but I have more modest ambitions.
You get only one round.
No, I’m sure your Grace won’t be able to persuade him to try a second round, even though you couldn’t dissuade him from trying the first.
You should mock me    I wish I were invisible, so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg.
Oh, what an excellent young man!
