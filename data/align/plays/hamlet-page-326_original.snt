Good madam.
Gertrude, do not drink.
I will, my lord.
I pray you, pardon me.
I dare not drink yet, madam.
By and by.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
I do not think â€™t.
Come, for the third, Laertes.
You do but dally.
I pray you, pass with your best violence.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
Say you so?
Come on.
Nothing, neither way.
Have at you now!
Part them!
They are incensed.
