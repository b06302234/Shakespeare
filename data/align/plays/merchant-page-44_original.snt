Even for that I thank you.
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune.
By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman, I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look, Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, To win the lady.
But, alas the while!
If Hercules and Lychas play at dice Which is the better man, the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker hand.
So is Alcides beaten by his page, And so may I, blind fortune leading me, Miss that which one unworthier may attain And die with grieving.
You must take your chance, And either not attempt to choose at all Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong Never to speak to lady afterward In way of marriage.
Therefore be advised.
Nor will not.
Come, bring me unto my chance.
First, forward to the temple.
After dinner Your hazard shall be made.
Good fortune then!— To make me blessed or cursed’st among men.
