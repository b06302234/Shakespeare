How many times have I had to live through cursed times of violent struggle?
My husband lost his life to get the crown, and my sons' fortunes have been tossed up and down, leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses.
And once one of them achieved the throne and had taken care of domestic quarrels, they made war among themselves.
It’s a preposterous outrage.
Let it end, or let me die so I won’t have to watch any more of it.
Wait, I’ll go with you.
You have no reason to.
