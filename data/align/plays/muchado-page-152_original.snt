I dare make his answer, none.
O, what men dare do!
What men may do!
What men daily do, not knowing what they do!
How now, interjections?
Why, then, some be of laughing, as, ah, ha, he!
Stand thee by, Friar.—Father, by your leave, Will you with free and unconstrainèd soul Give me this maid, your daughter?
As freely, son, as God did give her me.
And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
Nothing, unless you render her again.
Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.— There, Leonato, take her back again.
Give not this rotten orange to your friend.
She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor.
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
Oh, what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue?
Would you not swear, All you that see her, that she were a maid By these exterior shows?
But she is none.
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
