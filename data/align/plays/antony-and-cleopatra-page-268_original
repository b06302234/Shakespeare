Let’s speak to him.
Let’s hear him, for the things he speaks may concern Caesar.
Let’s do so.
But he sleeps.
Swoons rather, for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep.
Go we to him.
Awake, sir, awake.
Speak to us.
Hear you, sir?
The hand of death hath raught him.
Hark, the drums  Demurely wake the sleepers.
Let us bear him  To th’ court of guard.
He is of note.
Our hour  Is fully out.
Come on, then.
He may recover yet.
