I refuse your request.
I’m arresting you as a criminal.
Are you going to provoke me?
Alright, let’s fight, boy!
Oh Lord, they’re fighting!
I’ll go call the watch.
If you are merciful, open the tomb and lay me next to Juliet.
Alright, I will.
Let me look at this face.
It’s Mercutio’s relative, noble Count Paris!
What did my man say?
I was worried, so I wasn’t listening to him while we were riding.
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet.
Isn’t that what he said?
Or was I dreaming?
Or am I crazy?
Did I hear him say something about Juliet and jump to conclusions?
Oh, give me your hand.
Both of us had such bad luck!
I’ll bury you in a magnificent grave.
A grave?
Oh no!
This is a lantern, dead Paris.
Juliet lies here, and her beauty fills this tomb with light.
Dead men, lie there.
You are being buried by another dead man.
