Oh, your contemptible lady!
She has disarmed me.
No, Antony.
My mistress loved you, and her destiny was completely joined with yours.
Get out, insolent eunuch!
Silence!
She has betrayed me and shall die.
A person can only pay with their life once, and she has paid in full.
What you wanted is yours.
Her last words were “Antony!
Most noble Antony!” Then, as she was speaking your name, a strangled groan split her words.
Antony” was divided between her heart and lips.
She gave up her life with your name still within her.
Is she dead, then?
Dead.
Remove your armor, Eros.
The long day’s work is over, and it is time to sleep.
Off!
Take off my armor.
Not even Ajax’s famous shield, made of seven layers of oxhide and covered in bronze, could protect my heart from this attack.
Oh, chest, obey me!
Heart, for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined.
Break out of my ribcage!
Faster, Eros, faster.
I won’t be a soldier anymore.
Battered armor, be off.
You were worn with honor.
