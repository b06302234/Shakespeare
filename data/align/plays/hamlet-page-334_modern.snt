What do I see here?
What would you like to see?
If it’s a tragedy, you’ve come to the right place.
These corpses suggest mayhem.
Oh, proud Death, what banquet are you preparing that you’ve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke?
This is a horrible sight.
Our news arrives from England too late, since the people that should have heard it are dead.
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Who will thank us now?
Let’s hear about it right away and invite all the noblemen to listen.
As for me, I welcome my good luck with sadness.
I have some rights to claim this kingdom, and by arriving at this moment I have an opportunity to put them into effect.
