This becomes the great!
Sorry am I his numbers are so few, His soldiers sick and famished in their march, For, I am sure, when he shall see our army He’ll drop his heart into the sink of fear And for achievement offer us his ransom.
Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Montjoy And let him say to England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
Not so, I do beseech your Majesty.
Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
Now forth, Lord Constable and princes all, And quickly bring us word of England’s fall.
