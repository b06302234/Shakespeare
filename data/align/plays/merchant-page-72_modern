Well, you’ll see it with your own eyes.
You’ll see the difference between working for Shylock and working for Bassanio.— Jessica!
Who asked you to call her?
I’m not asking you to call her.
You always loved to tell me I couldn’t do anything without being told.
Did you call me?
Do you need something?
I’ve been invited to supper, Jessica.
Here are my keys.—But why should I go?
I wasn’t invited because they like me.
They’re just flattering me.
But I’ll go out of spite, to feed off the wasteful Christian.—Jessica, my girl, watch the house.
I don’t feel like going.
Things aren’t going my way right now.
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night.
