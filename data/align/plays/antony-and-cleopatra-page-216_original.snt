Take hence this jack and whip him.
Than with an old one dying.
Moon and stars!
Whip him.
Were ’t twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her name Since she was Cleopatra?
Whip him, fellows, Till like a boy, you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy.
Take him hence.
Mark Antony—                                  Tug him away!
Being whipped, Bring him again.
This jack of Caesar’s shall Bear us an errand to him.
Have I my pillow left unpressed in Rome, Forborne the getting of a lawful race, And by a gem of women, to be abused By one that looks on feeders?
Good my lord— You have been a boggler ever.
But when we in our viciousness grow hard— Oh, misery on ’t!—the wise gods seel our eyes, In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us Adore our errors, laugh at ’s while we strut To our confusion.
