How excellent for Antony!
Her ladies-in-waiting—like  Extraordinary Egyptian!
When she landed at the port, Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper.
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead.
Our courteous Antony, who has never said “no” to any woman, after spending plenty of time being groomed by the barber, goes to the feast.
For that simple meal, he paid with his heart—even though it was only his eyes that were satisfied.
