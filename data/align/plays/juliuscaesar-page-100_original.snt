What enterprise, Popillius?
Fare you well.
He wished today our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discoverèd.
Look how he makes to Caesar.
Mark him.
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention —Brutus, what shall be done?
If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself.
Cassius, be constant.
Popillius Lena speaks not of our purposes.
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
Trebonius knows his time.
For, look you, Brutus.
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
Where is Metellus Cimber?
Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
