You haven’t seen him since?
Sir, sir, that can’t be true.
If I weren’t a merciful man, I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place.
But do this: find your brother, wherever he is.
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year, or get out off my land.
I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt.
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter: I have never in my life loved my brother.
That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands.
Do this immediately, and send him packing.
