What’s going on?
What have you heard from her?
I’m sorry, but they wouldn’t let me in.
But I got the following answer from her handmaid.
Olivia’s not going to show her face for the next seven years—not even to the sky itself.
Instead, she’ll go around veiled like a nun, and once a day she’ll water her room with tears.
She’s doing this out of love for her dead brother, whom she wants to keep fresh in her memory forever.
Oh, if she loves her brother this much, think how she’ll love me when I finally win her over and make her forget all her other attachments!
Her mind and heart will be ruled by one man alone—me!
Take me to the garden.
I need a beautiful place to sit and think about love.
