Arise, and say how thou camest here.
Oh, wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is!

Tis new to thee.
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours.
Is she the goddess that hath severed us And brought us thus together?
Sir, she is mortal.
But by immortal providence, she’s mine.
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one.
She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Of whom so often I have heard renown But never saw before, of whom I have Received a second life.
And second father This lady makes him to me.
I am hers.
But oh, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness!
There, sir, stop.
Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that’s gone.
