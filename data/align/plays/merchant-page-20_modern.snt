We might as well call him a man, since God created him.
No, I know it’s bad to make fun of people, but still!
His horse is better than the Neapolitan’s and he frowns more than the Count Palatine.
He was trying to outdo everyone so much that you couldn’t tell who he was.
He started dancing every time a bird sang, and he was so eager to show off his fencing that he’d fight with his own shadow.
If I married him, I might as well as marry twenty husbands, because he’s like twenty men all rolled into one!
I’d understand it if he hated me, since even if he loved me desperately, I’d never be able to love him back.
What about Falconbridge, that young English baron?
I have no opinion about him.
We don’t talk because we don’t understand each other.
He doesn’t speak Latin, French, or Italian, and you know how little English I speak.
He’s great-looking, but how can you talk to someone who doesn’t speak your language?
He was dressed so oddly too!
I think he got his jacket in Italy, his tights in France, his hat in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.
What do you think of his neighbor, the Scottish lord?
I think he’s very forgiving, since he let the Englishman slap him on the ear without hitting him back.
Rather than defend himself, he just threatened to pay the Englishman back later.
Then the Frenchman promised to help the Scot pay the Englishman back, and added a slap of his own.
