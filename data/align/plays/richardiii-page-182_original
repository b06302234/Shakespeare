We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
Tomorrow, in my judgement, is too sudden, For I myself am not so well provided As else I would be, were the day prolonged.
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester?
I have sent for these strawberries.
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning.
There’s some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
I think there’s never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he, For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
What of his heart perceive you in his face By any livelihood he showed today?
Marry, that with no man here he is offended, For were he, he had shown it in his looks.
I pray God he be not, I say.
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve That do conspire my death with devilish plots Of damnèd witchcraft, and that have prevailed Upon my body with their hellish charms?
