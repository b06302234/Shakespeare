Who’s there?
No, who are  Long live the king!
Is that Barnardo?
Yes, it’s me.
You’ve come right on time.
The clock’s just striking twelve.
Go home to bed, Francisco.
Thanks for letting me go.
It’s bitterly cold out, and I’m depressed.
Has it been a quiet night?
I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak.
Well, good night.
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus, who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight, tell them to hurry.
I think I hear them.
Stop!
Who’s there?
