Wait, I will win the wager more spectacularly, going even further to demonstrate her obedience, her newly created virtue and obedience.
Look, here she comes, with your ungovernable wives in tow, like prisoners of her womanly persuasion.—Katherine, that cap of yours doesn’t look good on you.
Take it off and throw it on the ground.
Lord, may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that.
For shame!
What kind of loyalty is this?
I wish your loyalty were as foolish.
The wisdom of your loyalty, fair Bianca, has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner.
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty.
Katherine, I’d like you to lecture these headstrong women on the nature of the loyalty they owe their lords and husbands.
You must be joking.
There will be no lecture.
Do it, I say.
You can begin with her.
She shall not.
I say she shall.—And first begin with her.
