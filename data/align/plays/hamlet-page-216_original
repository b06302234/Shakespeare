Safely stowed.
But soft, what noise?
Who calls on Hamlet?
Oh, here they come.
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.
Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel.
Do not believe it.
Believe what?
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge!
What replication should be made by the son of a king?
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
