Sweet saint, for goodness’s sake, don’t be so angry.
Ugly devil, for God’s sake, get out of here and leave us alone.
You have made the happy world into your hell, filling it with cursing cries and lamentations.
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds, take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries.
Oh, gentlemen, look, look!
Dead Henry’s wounds have opened up and are bleeding again!
Shame on you, you deformed lump.
It’s your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins.
Your inhuman and unnatural actions have provoked this unnatural flood of blood.
Oh God, who made this blood, revenge his death!
Oh earth, which soaks up this blood, revenge his death!
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him, as it does this good king’s blood.
