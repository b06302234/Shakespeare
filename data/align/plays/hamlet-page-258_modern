Now you’ve got to acknowledge my innocence and believe I’m your friend, since you’ve heard and understood that the man who killed your father was trying to kill me.
It looks that way.
But tell me why you didn’t take immediate action against his criminal acts, when your own safety and everything else would seem to call for it.
Oh, for two main reasons which may seem weak to you, but strong to me.
The queen, his mother, is devoted to him.
And (for better or worse, whichever it is) she is such a part of my life and soul that I can’t live apart from her, any more than a planet can leave its orbit.
The other reason why I couldn’t prosecute and arrest Hamlet is that the public loves him.
In their affection they overlook all his faults.
Like magic, they convert them into virtues, so whatever I said against him would end up hurting me, not him.
