Your compensation makes amends, for I Have given you here a third of mine own life— Or that for which I live—who once again I tender to thy hand.
All thy vexations Were but my trials of thy love and thou Hast strangely stood the test.
Here, afore heaven, I ratify this my rich gift.
O Ferdinand, Do not smile at me that I boast of her, For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise And make it halt behind her.
I do believe it Against an oracle.
Then as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchased, take my daughter.
But If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be ministered, No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow, but barren hate, Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both.
Therefore take heed, As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.
