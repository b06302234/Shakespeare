Come, dance in a circle and sing a fairy song, and then go off for a while to do your work.
Some of you will kill the worms infesting the rosebuds, some of you will fight with bats to get their leathery wings, so we can make coats for my small elves.
Some of you will keep that loud owl away, the one that hoots and wonders every night at us dainty fairies.
Sing me to sleep now, and then go off to do your duties and let me rest.
