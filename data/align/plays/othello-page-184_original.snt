Pray heaven it be State matters, as you think, and no conception Nor no jealous toy concerning you.
Alas the day!
I never gave him cause.
But jealous souls will not be answered so.
They are not ever jealous for the cause, But jealous for they’re jealous.
It is a monster Begot upon itself, born on itself.
Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind!
Lady, amen.
I will go seek him.—Cassio, walk hereabout.
If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
I humbly thank your ladyship.
Save you, friend Cassio!
