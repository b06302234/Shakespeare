Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
Most certain, sir.
Who is conductor of his people?
As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.
Report is changeable.
Tis time to look about.
The powers of the kingdom approach apace.
The arbitrament is like to be bloody.
Fare you well, sir.
My point and period will be throughly wrought, Or well or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought.
