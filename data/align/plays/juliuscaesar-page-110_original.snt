How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust!
So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called “The men that gave their country liberty.” What, shall we forth?
Ay, every man away.
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Soft!
Who comes here?
A friend of Antony’s.
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest.
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.
Say I love Brutus, and I honor him.
Say I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him.
