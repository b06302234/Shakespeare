That’s just how I want him to behave toward the drunkard, speaking in a low, soft voice and in humble, courteous tones and saying fancy stuff like, “What does your Honor wish to command your lady, your humble wife, to do to show her devotion and demonstrate her love?” Tell him to give the drunkard fond embraces and alluring kisses, and lay his head on the other man’s breast, weeping like a woman overjoyed to see a husband restored to health who for the last seven years has imagined he was no better than a poor, pathetic beggar.
The boy may lack a woman’s gift for weeping at will, so it might be good to have an onion handy, hidden in a handkerchief.
That’ll make his eyes stream.
Get this done as quickly as you can.
I’ll give you more instructions later.
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman, taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures.
I can’t wait to hear him call the drunkard “husband,” and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant.
I’ll go and coach them.
My presence may put a damper on their high spirits, which might otherwise get out of control.
