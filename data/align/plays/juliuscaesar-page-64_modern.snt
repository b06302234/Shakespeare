But I’m still afraid of him, because the deep-rooted love he has for Caesar— Alas, good Cassius, don’t think about him.
If he loves Caesar, then he can only hurt himself—by grieving and dying for Caesar.
And I’d be surprised if he even did that, for he prefers sports, fun, and friends.
There’s nothing to fear in him.
Let’s not kill him.
He’ll live and laugh at this afterward.
Quiet!
Count how many times the clock chimes.
The clock struck three.
It’s time to leave.
But we still don’t know whether Caesar will go out in public today or not, because he’s become superstitious lately, a complete turnaround from when he used to have such a bad opinion of fortune-tellers, dream interpreters, and ritual mumbo-jumbo.
It might happen that these strange signs, the unusual terror of this night, and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today.
Don’t worry about that.
If he’s reluctant, I can convince him.
He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers, just like unicorns can be captured in trees, elephants in holes, and lions with nets.
When I tell him he hates flatterers, he agrees, just at the moment when I’m flattering him the most.
Let me work on him.
I can put him in the right mood, and I’ll bring him to the Capitol.
