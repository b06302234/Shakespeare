And there I stood amazèd for a while As on a pillory, looking through the lute, While she did call me “rascal fiddler” And “twangling Jack”; with twenty such vile terms, As had she studied to misuse me so.
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench.
I love her ten times more than e'er I did.
Oh, how I long to have some chat with her!
to HORTENSIO as LITIO) Well, go with me and be not so discomfited.
Proceed in practice with my younger daughter.
She’s apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us, Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
I pray you do.
I’ll attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she rail; why then I’ll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
Say that she frown; I’ll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew.
Say she be mute and will not speak a word; Then I’ll commend her volubility, And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.
If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks, As though she bid me stay by her a week.
If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be marrièd.
But here she comes—and now, Petruchio, speak.
