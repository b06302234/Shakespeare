No, monster, not me.
Don’t be scared.
This island is full of noises, strange sounds and sweet melodies that make you feel good and don’t hurt anyone.
Sometimes I hear a thousand twanging instruments hum at my ears, and sometimes voices that send me back to sleep even if I had just woken up—and then I dreamed of clouds opening up and dropping such riches on me that when I woke up, I cried because I wanted to dream again.
This’ll be a wonderful kingdom to live in, where they play music for free.
As soon as you kill Prospero.
That’ll happen soon enough.
I remember the plan.
The sound is going away.
But let’s follow it, and then do our dirty work afterward.
Lead us, monster; we’ll follow.
I wish I could see this invisible drummer.
He really plays well.
I’m right behind you, Stephano.
Are you coming monster?
