I am tired.
Leave me alone for a minute.
Oh my, my bones ache so much.
I’ve been running all over the place.
I wish you had my bones, and I had your news.
Come on now, I beg you, speak, good Nurse, speak.
Sweet Jesus, you’re in such a hurry!
Can’t you wait for a moment?
Don’t you see that I’m out of breath?
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you’re out of breath?
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself.
Is the news good or bad?
Answer that question.
Tell me if it’s good or bad, and I’ll wait for the details.
Tell me so I can be satisfied.
Is it good or bad?
Well, you have made a foolish choice.
You don’t know how to pick a man.
Romeo?
No, not him, though his face is more handsome than any man’s, and his legs are prettier, and as for his hands and feet and body, they’re not much to speak of, and yet they’re beyond compare.
He’s not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he’s gentle as a lamb.
Well, do what you want.
Be good.
Have you had lunch yet?
No, I haven’t had lunch.
Everything you told me I already knew.
What does he say about our marriage?
What about that?
Lord, what a headache I’ve got!
My head is pounding.
It feels like it’ll break into twenty pieces.
My back aches too—
