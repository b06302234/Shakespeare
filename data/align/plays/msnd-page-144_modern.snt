And he would have deserved it too.
Pyramus is worth  Where are my guys?
Where are my good fellows?
Bottom!
Oh, how wonderful to see you!
Oh, what a relief!
My friends, I’ve got some amazing things to tell you—but don’t ask me to tell you what.
I swear by my Athenian citizenship that I won’t tell you anything.
I’ll tell you everything exactly as it happened.
Tell us, Bottom.
No, you won’t get a word out of me.
All I’ll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already.
Now it’s time to get your costumes together.
Find some good strings for tying on your false beards, and grab new ribbons to decorate your shoes.
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible.
Look over your lines again.
Our play’s going to be performed for the duke!
So make sure Thisbe’s wearing clean underwear, and make sure whoever’s playing the lion doesn’t cut his nails, because he needs them long to look like lion’s claws.
And no one eat any onions or garlic.
If we have sweet-smelling breath, I’m sure they’ll say “it’s a sweet play.” Now no more talking.
Get busy, go!
