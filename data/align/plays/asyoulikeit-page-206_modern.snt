Twenty-five, sir.
A mature age.
Is your name William?
Yes, it’s William, sir.
A good name.
Were you born here in the forest?
Yes sir, thank God.
Thank God”—that’s a good answer.
Are you rich?
Well, so-so.
So-so” is good, very good, an excellent answer.
And then again, it’s not so good, but only so-so.
Are you wise?
Yes sir, I’m fairly witty.
Well, that’s a fine answer.
I seem to remember a saying: “Only a fool thinks he’s wise; the  I do, sir.
Give me your hand.
Are you educated?
No, sir.
