All thy tediousness on me, ah?
Yea, an ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis, for I hear as good exclamation on your Worship as of any man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.
And so am I. I would fain know what you have to say.
Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your Worship’s presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina.
A good old man, sir.
He will be talking.
As they say, “When the age is in, the wit is out.” God help us, it is a world to see!
Well said, i' faith, neighbor Verges.—Well, God’s a good man.
An two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind.
An honest soul, i' faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever broke bread, but God is to be worshipped, all men are not alike, alas, good neighbor!
Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.
Gifts that God gives.
I must leave you.
One word, sir.
Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before your worship.
