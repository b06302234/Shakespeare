Did it really work?
Like medicine for a sick man.
If you want to really have some fun, watch him next time he’s near Lady Olivia.
He’ll show up in yellow stockings—she hates yellow—and with laces crisscrossing up his legs—she hates that style of dress—and he’ll smile, which will go completely against her mood, since she’s addicted to sadness now.
She’ll definitely get upset with him.
If you want to watch, follow me.
I’d follow you to the gates of Hell, you sneaky little devil!
I’ll come too.
