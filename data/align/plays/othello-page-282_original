Roderigo killed?
And Cassio killed!
No, Cassio is not killed.
Not Cassio killed!
Then murder’s out of tune, And sweet revenge grows harsh.
Oh, falsely, falsely murdered!
Alas, what cry is that?
That?
What?
Out and alas, that was my lady’s voice.
Help!
Help, ho, help!
O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona!
O sweet mistress, speak!
A guiltless death I die.
Oh, who hath done this deed?
Nobody.
I myself.
Farewell.
Commend me to my kind lord.
Oh, farewell!
Why, how should she be murdered?
Alas, who knows?
You heard her say herself it was not I.
