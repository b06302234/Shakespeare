What says Lord Stanley?
Will he bring his power?
My lord, he doth deny to come.
Off with his son Georgeâ€™s head!
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh.
After the battle let George Stanley die.
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom.
Advance our standards.
Set upon our foes.
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George, Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons.
Upon them!
Victory sits on our helms.
