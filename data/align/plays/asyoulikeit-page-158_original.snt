But, mistress, know yourself.
Down on your knees And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love, For I must tell you friendly in your ear, Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer.
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
So take her to thee, shepherd.
Fare you well.
Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together.
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
He’s fall'n in love with your foulness.
For no ill will I bear you.
I pray you, do not fall in love with me, For I am falser than vows made in wine.
Besides, I like you not.
If you will know my house, 'Tis at the tuft of olives, here hard by.
Will you go, sister?—Shepherd, ply her hard.
Come, sister.—Shepherdess, look on him better, And be not proud.
Though all the world could see, None could be so abused in sight as he.
Come, to our flock.
Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might: “Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”
