I’ll send her out to you now.
I’ll think of a plan to get the Moor out of the way, so you can speak more openly.
I humbly thank you.
Even for a  Good morning, lieutenant.
I’m sorry about what happened, but I’m sure everything will turn out all right.
The general and his wife are talking about it now, and she’s defending you strongly.
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus, and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you.
But he says he still loves and respects you, and based on his own feelings alone he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back.
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if you think that’s all right.
Please come in.
I’ll take you to a place where you can speak freely.
Thank you very much.
