Here’s a sick man who wants to speak with you.
It’s Caius Ligarius, whom Metellus spoke of.
Boy, stand aside.
Caius Ligarius!
How are you?
Please accept my feeble “good morning.” Oh, what a time you’ve chosen to be sick, brave Caius!
How I wish you felt better!
I’m not sick if you’ve prepared some honorable exploit for me.
Indeed, I would have such an exploit for you, Ligarius, if you were healthy enough to hear it.
A deed that will make sick men healthy.
But aren’t there some healthy men whom we have to make sick?
That too.
My dear Caius, I’ll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to.
