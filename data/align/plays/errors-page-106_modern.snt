She’s the devil.
No, she’s worse: she’s the devil’s mother, and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench.
And that’s why some women say, “God damn me,” which is the same thing as saying, “God make me an easy wench.” The Bible says the devil looks like an angel of light.
But fire also gives off light, and fire will burn you.
In other words, easy wenches will burn you.
Keep away from this one.
You and your servant are very funny, sir.
Will you come with me?
Can we finish our lunch?
Master, if you eat with her, bring really long silverware.
Why, Dromio?
Because of the old saying: “He who eats with the devil needs a very long spoon.” You need to keep far away from them.
Give me back the ring I gave you at lunch, or give me the necklace you promised in exchange.
Then I’ll be gone, sir, and stop troubling you.
