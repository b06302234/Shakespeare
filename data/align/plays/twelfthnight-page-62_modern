Although many people said she looked like me, she was considered beautiful.
And though I can’t believe everything people said about her beauty, I’ll be so bold as to say she had a beautiful mind.
Even those who were jealous of her would have to admit that.
She’s been drowned in salty sea water, and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again.
I’m sorry I wasn’t a better host for you, sir.
Oh, Antonio, I’m sorry I caused you so much trouble.
I care about you a lot.
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you.
You’ll be killing me if you don’t.
If you don’t want to break my heart, then say goodbye to me right now.
I like you very much.
I’m really about to cry, just like my mother would do.
I’m going to Count Orsino’s court.
Goodbye.
I wish you all the best.
If I didn’t have so many enemies in Orsino’s court, I’d go join you there.
But who cares.
I’m so crazy about you that danger doesn’t bother me.
I’ll go anyway.
