Lie thou there (throwing down a letter), for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.
Tis but fortune, all is fortune.
Maria once told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself come thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion.
Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her.
What should I think on â€™t?
To be Count Malvolio!
