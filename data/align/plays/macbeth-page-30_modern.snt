The witches met me on the day of my victory in battle, and I have since learned that they have supernatural knowledge.
When I tried desperately to question them further, they vanished into thin air.
While I stood spellbound, messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor, which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me ’the future king!
I thought I should tell you this news, my dearest partner in greatness, so that you could rejoice along with me about the greatness that is promised to us.
Keep it secret, and farewell.”
