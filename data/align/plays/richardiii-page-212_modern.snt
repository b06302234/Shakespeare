My lord, what you’ve said makes clear you have a conscience, but your objections are trivial, given the circumstances.
You say that Prince Edward is your brother’s son.
We agree, but not by your brother’s wife.
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy—your mother can vouch for that—and then he was betrothed to Bona, the King of France’s sister-in-law.
But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey, a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed-out widow long past her prime.
Nevertheless, under pretence of asking a favor of him, she attracted his lustful eye and seduced him so thoroughly that he completely debased himself, committing adultery with her.
It resulted in this Edward, whom we’re polite enough to call “Prince.” Out of respect for the living, I’ll restrain myself from telling you everything.
But, my good lord, if you don’t care about this country, at least use your own pure lineage to rescue us from the current corruption of the royal line.
