Here’s a knocking indeed!
If a man were porter of hell-gate, he should have old turning the key.
Knock, knock, knock!
Who’s there, i' th' name of Beelzebub?
Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty.
Come in time, have napkins enough about you, here you’ll sweat for ’t.
Knock, knock!
Who’s there, in th' other devil’s name?
Faith, here’s an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven.
O, come in, equivocator.
Knock, knock, knock!
Who’s there?
Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose.
Come in, tailor.
Here you may roast your goose.
