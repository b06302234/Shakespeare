Oh, how bitter it is that Edward—the real “true, noble prince”—should still be alive!
Cousin, you didn’t used to be so thickheaded.
Shall I put it plainly?
I want the bastards dead.
And I want it done right away.
What do you say?
Speak now and to the point.
Your Grace can do whatever he wants.
Tut, tut, you’ve become rather icy.
Your friendliness toward me seems to be freezing over.
Tell me, do I have your consent to kill them?
Give me a little breathing space, my lord, a little pause to think.
I’ll let you know my answer shortly.
My lord?
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money?
