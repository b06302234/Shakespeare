No, God help me, they didn’t say a word.
Like silent statues or stones that breathed, they just gazed at each other and turned as pale as the dead.
When I saw this, I scolded them and asked the mayor what this stubborn silence meant.
He said that the people weren’t used to being spoken to except by the  What blocks of wood!
They wouldn’t say anything?
Aren’t the mayor and his fellow citizens coming?
The mayor is here at hand.
Pretend you’re afraid, my lord, and don’t speak until you’re pleaded with.
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests, okay?
Then I’ll have the grounds to build a holy sermon about why you should be king.
But don’t be easily won over.
Act like a virgin, always answering “No,” but taking it in the end.
I’m going now.
If you’re as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you, this will definitely come to a happy end.
