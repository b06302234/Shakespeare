And welcome, welcome!
Die where you have lived, in my arms.
Let me revive you with my kisses.
If my lips had the power to give life, I would wear them out like this.
What a sad sight!
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
Give me some wine and let me say a few words.
No, let me talk, and let me scold to the heavens, so that  One thing, dear Queen: request honor, as well as safety, from Caesar.
Oh!
Honor and safety do not go together.
Dear, listen to me: don’t trust any of Caesar’s men besides Proculeius.
I’ll trust my determination and my hands, but none of Caesar’s men.
Don’t mourn over this unhappy reversal of fortune at the end of my life.
Remember my earlier lot, when I lived as the greatest, most noble prince in the world.
I’m not dying shamefully, doffing my helmet to my countryman like a coward, but as a Roman, honorably conquered by another Roman.
Now I feel my soul leaving.
I can’t speak any more.
