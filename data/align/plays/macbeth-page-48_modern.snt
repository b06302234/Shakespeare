How’s the night going, boy?
The moon has set.
The clock hasn’t struck yet.
The moon sets at twelve, right?
I think it’s later than that, sir.
Here, take my sword.
The heavens are being stingy with their light.
Take this, too.
I’m tired and feeling heavy, but I can’t sleep.
Merciful powers, keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest!
Give me my sword.
Who’s there?
A friend.
You’re not asleep yet, sir?
The king’s in bed.
He’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants.
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality.
Because we were unprepared for the king’s visit, we weren’t able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to.
