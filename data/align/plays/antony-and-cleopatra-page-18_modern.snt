Well, give me the worst news.
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it.
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward.
Go on.
As far as I’m concerned, what’s past is done.
It’s like this: as long as a person tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as though he praised me.
The news is disturbing.
While Antony . . .” is what you want to say.
Oh, my lord!
Speak plainly.
Don’t tone down what the people are saying.
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her.
Use Fulvia’s abusive language.
Freely scold me for my faults with as much severity as an enemy with truth on his side.
It’s easy to err when left to our own devices, but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them.
Good-bye for a while.
