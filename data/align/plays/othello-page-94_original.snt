Fore heaven, an excellent song.
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting.
Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander—Drink, ho!—are nothing to your English.
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain.
He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.
To the health of our general!
I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you justice.
Oh, sweet England!
Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
Will you hear ’t again?
No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things.
Well, heaven’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
It’s true, good lieutenant.
