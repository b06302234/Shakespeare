Sir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you.
There’s a feud between Albany and Cornwall, although they’ve been clever enough to hide it thus far.
Like other powerful rulers, they have servants who are actually French spies in disguise.
These spies have noticed something, perhaps in the squabbles between Albany and Cornwall, or in the tough line both of them have taken against the good old king, or perhaps in some deeper matter at the root of both of these problems—The point is that the King of France has sent troops into our divided kingdom.
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war.
Now this is where you come in.
If you trust me enough to hurry to Dover, you’ll earn the gratitude of many people when you fairly report the monstrous and maddening extent of the king’s suffering.
I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you.
Let’s discuss it some more.
