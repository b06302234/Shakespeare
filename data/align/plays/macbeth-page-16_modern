Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
Wait!
You only told me part of what I want to know.
Stay and tell me more.
I already know I am the thane of Glamis because I inherited the position when my father, Sinel, died.
But how can you call me the thane of Cawdor?
The thane of Cawdor is alive, and he’s a rich and powerful man.
And for me to be the king is completely impossible, just as it’s impossible for me to be thane of Cawdor.
Tell me where you learned these strange things, and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting?
Speak, I command you.
The earth has bubbles, just like the water, and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth.
Where did they disappear to?
Into thin air.
Their bodies melted like breath in the wind.
I wish they had stayed!
Were these things we’re talking about really here?
Or are we both on drugs?
Your children will be kings.
You will be the king.
And thane of Cawdor too.
Isn’t that what they said?
That’s exactly what they said.
Who’s this?
