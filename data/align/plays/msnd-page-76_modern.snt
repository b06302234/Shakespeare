Oh, Bottom, you’ve changed!
What have you got on your head?
What do you think I’ve got on my head?
You’re acting like an ass, don’t you think?
God bless you, Bottom, God bless you.
You’ve been changed.
Reborn.
I see what they’re up to.
They want to make an ass of me, to scare me if they can.
But I won’t leave this spot, no matter what they do.
I’ll walk up and down and sing a song, so they’ll know I’m not afraid.
