Please, give me that goblet, if you love me.
Let go of it!
I’ll get it from you, I swear.
Oh God, Horatio, what a damaged reputation I’m leaving behind me, as no one knows the truth.
If you ever loved me, then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile, and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story.
What are these warlike noises?
Young Fortinbras, returning in triumph from Poland, is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors.
Oh, I’m dying, Horatio!
This strong poison’s overpowering me.
I will not live to hear the news from England.
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown.
He’s got my vote as I die.
So tell him that, given the recent events here—oh, the rest is silence.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Now a noble heart is breaking.
Good night, sweet prince.
May hosts of angels sing you to sleep.—Why are those drums approaching?
