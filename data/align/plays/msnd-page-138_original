And I have found Demetrius like a jewel, Mine own, and not mine own.
Are you sure That we are awake?
It seems to me That yet we sleep, we dream.
Do not you think The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
Yea, and my father.
And Hippolyta.
And he did bid us follow to the temple.
Why then, we are awake.
Letâ€™s follow him And by the way let us recount our dreams.
