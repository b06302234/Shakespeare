Consort?
What, dost thou make us minstrels?
An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords.
Here’s my fiddlestick.
Here’s that shall make you dance.
Zounds, “consort”!
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
Either withdraw unto some private place, And reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart.
Here all eyes gaze on us.
Men’s eyes were made to look and let them gaze.
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.
Well, peace be with you, sir.
Here comes my man.
But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower.
Your worship in that sense may call him “man.” Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: thou art a villain.
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting.
Villain am I none.
Therefore, farewell.
I see thou know’st me not.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me.
Therefore turn and draw.
