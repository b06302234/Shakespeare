What is this passion that ties up my tongue?
I can’t speak to her, even though she asked me to.
Oh, poor Orlando, you’ve been overthrown!
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you.
Good sir, as a friend, I advise you to leave this place.
Although you deserve praise, applause, and love, right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done.
The duke is temperamental.
I’m sure you can imagine what I mean without my having to spell it out.
Thank you, sir.
Now please tell me this: which of the two ladies who were at the wrestling match is the duke’s daughter?
Neither one is his daughter, to judge from their good manners.
But really, the smaller one is his daughter.
The other is the daughter of the banished duke.
Duke Frederick keeps her for his daughter’s sake; the love between the two of them is stronger than the bond between sisters.
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece, and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake.
I swear, one day the duke’s malice toward Rosalind will suddenly erupt.
Goodbye, sir.
Later, in a better world than this, I’d love to get to know you.
