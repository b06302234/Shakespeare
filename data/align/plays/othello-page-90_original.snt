Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature.
What an eye she has!
Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.
An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.
And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
She is indeed perfection.
Well, happiness to their sheets!
Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello.
Not tonight, good Iago.
I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking.
I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.
Oh, they are our friends.
But one cup.
I’ll drink for you.
I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here.
I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.
What, man, ’tis a night of revels!
The gallants desire it.
Where are they?
Here at the door.
I pray you call them in.
I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me.
