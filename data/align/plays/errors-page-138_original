Be quiet and depart.
Thou shalt not have him.
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.
Come, go.
I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
By this, I think, the dial points at five.
Anon, Iâ€™m sure, the Duke himself in person Comes this way to the melancholy vale, The place of death and sorry execution Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
Upon what cause?
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant, Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town, Beheaded publicly for his offense.
See where they come.
We will behold his death.
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.
Yet once again proclaim it publicly, If any friend will pay the sum for him, He shall not die; so much we tender him.
