My old bones ache.
Hereâ€™s a maze trod indeed Through forthrights and meanders.
By your patience, I needs must rest me.
Old lord, I cannot blame thee, Who am myself attached with weariness To th' dulling of my spirits.
Sit down and rest.
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it No longer for my flatterer.
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land.
Well, let him go.
Do not for one repulse forego the purpose That you resolved t' effect.
Will we take throughly.
For now they are oppressed with travel.
They Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance As when they are fresh.
