Oh, he’s been betrayed, and I’ve been ruined.
What, you whore, are you crying for him right in front of me?
Send me away, my lord, but don’t kill me!
Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight.
No, if you struggle with me— Just half an hour!
While I’m doing this, I can’t pause for a moment.
Just let me say one prayer!
It’s too late.
What’s that noise?
Aren’t you dead yet?
I know I’m cruel, but I’m merciful too.
I don’t want you to linger in pain.
Who’s there?
