Wait, Petruchio, I should go with you.
My own “wealth” is in Baptista’s keeping.
His youngest daughter, the beautiful Bianca, is the jewel of my life, and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand.
Because he finds it so incredible—owing to those character deficiencies I mentioned before—that any man will ever come courting Katherina, Baptista has therefore issued this edict: that none shall be permitted to court Bianca until that Katherine the shrew finds a husband.
Katherine the shrew!” That’s the worst thing you can call a young woman.
Now my friend Petruchio will help me out, presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well-versed in music.
I’ll disguise myself in somber robes.
In this costume, I’ll be able to spend time with her alone, which will give me plenty of opportunity to court her.
