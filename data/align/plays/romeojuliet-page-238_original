Death is my son-in-law.
Death is my heir.
My daughter he hath wedded.
I will die, And leave him all.
Life, living, all is Death’s.
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face, And doth it give me such a sight as this?
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage.
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catched it from my sight!
O woe!
O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
Most lamentable day, most woeful day That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day, O day, O day, O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this.
O woeful day, O woeful day!
Beguiled, divorcèd, wrongèd, spited, slain!
Most detestable Death, by thee beguiled, By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown!
O love!
O life!
Not life, but love in death.
Despised, distressèd, hated, martyred, killed!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child, O child!
My soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou!
Alack, my child is dead, And with my child my joys are buried.
Peace, ho, for shame!
Confusion’s cure lives not In these confusions.
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid.
Now heaven hath all,
