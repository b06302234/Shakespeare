Oh, what an obstacle that would be!
Imagine being too high on the social ladder, and falling in love with someone beneath you.
Or else they were very different ages— How awful!
Being too old to marry someone young.
Or else their guardians and advisors said no— What hell, to have your love life determined by someone else!
Or, even if the lovers are a good match, their love might be ruined by war, death, or sickness, so that the affair only lasts an instant.
Their time together might be as fleeting as a shadow or as short as a dream, lasting only as long as it takes a lightning bolt to flash across the sky.
Before you can say “look,” it’s gone.
That’s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed.
If true lovers are always thwarted, then it must be a rule of fate.
So let’s try to be patient as we deal with our problem.
It’s as normal a part of love as dreams, sighs, wishes, and tears.
That’s the right attitude.
So, listen, Hermia.
I have an aunt who is a widow, who’s very rich and doesn’t have any children.
She lives about twenty miles from Athens, and she thinks of me as a son.
I could marry you there, gentle Hermia, where the strict laws of Athens can’t touch us.
So here’s the plan.
If you love me, sneak out of your father’s house tomorrow night and meet me in the forest a few miles outside of town.
