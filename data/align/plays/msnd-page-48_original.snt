Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase.
The dove pursues the griffin.
The mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger—bootless speed, When cowardice pursues and valor flies.
I will not stay thy questions.
Let me go.
Or if thou follow me, do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field You do me mischief.
Fie, Demetrius!
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.
We cannot fight for love as men may do.
We should be wooed and were not made to woo.
I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell, To die upon the hand I love so well.
Fare thee well, nymph.
Ere he do leave this grove, Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
Hast thou the flower there?
Welcome, wanderer.
Ay, there it is.
I pray thee, give it me.
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet musk roses and with eglantine.
