Let the king have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death.
I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb, yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter.
These good fellows will bring thee where I am.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England.
Of them I have much to tell thee.
Fare-well.
He that thou knowest thine,       Hamlet.” Come, I will give you way for these your letters, And do ’t the speedier, that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them.
