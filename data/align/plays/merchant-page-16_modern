Oh Nerissa, my poor little body is tired of this great big world.
You’d be tired, madam, if you had bad luck rather than wealth and good luck.
But as far as I can tell, people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing.
The best way to be happy is to be in between.
When you have too much you get old sooner, but having just enough helps you live longer.
Good point, and well said.
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life.
You think it’s that easy?
If doing good deeds were as easy as knowing how to do them, then everyone would be better off.
Small chapels would be big churches, and poor men’s cottages would be princes' palaces.
It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches.
For me, it’s easier to lecture twenty people on how to be good than to be the one person out of twenty who actually does good things.
The brain can tell the heart what to do, but what does it matter?
Cold rules don’t matter when you’ve got a hot temper.
Young people are like frisky young rabbits, and good advice is like a crippled old man trying to catch them.
But thinking like this won’t help me choose a husband.
Oh, the word “choose” is strange!
I can’t choose who I like, or refuse who I dislike.
I’m a living daughter still controlled by the wishes of her dead father.
Isn’t it a pain that I can’t choose or refuse anyone, Nerissa?
