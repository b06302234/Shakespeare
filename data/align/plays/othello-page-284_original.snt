She said so.
I must needs report the truth.
She’s like a liar gone to burning hell.
Twas I that killed her.
Oh, the more angel she, And you the blacker devil!
She turned to folly, and she was a whore.
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
She was false as water.
Thou art rash as fire, To say that she was false.
Oh, she was heavenly true!
Cassio did top her, ask thy husband else.
Oh, I were damned beneath all depth in hell, But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity.
Thy husband knew it all.
My husband!
Thy husband.
That she was false to wedlock?
Ay, with Cassio.
Had she been true, If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect chrysolite, I’d not have sold her for it.
My husband?
