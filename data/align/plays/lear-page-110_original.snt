Good King, that must approve the common saw, Thou out of heaven’s benediction comest To the warm sun.
Approach, thou beacon to this underglobe, That by thy comfortable beams I may Peruse this letter.
Nothing almost sees miracles But misery.
I know ’tis from Cordelia, Who hath most fortunately been informed Of my obscurèd course and  From this enormous state, seeking to give Losses their remedies.” All weary and o'erwatched, Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold This shameful lodging.
Fortune, good night.
Smile once more.
Turn thy wheel.
