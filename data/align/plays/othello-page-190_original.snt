Will you think so?
Think so, Iago?
What, To kiss in private?
An unauthorized kiss!
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
It is hypocrisy against the devil.
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so, The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.
But if I give my wife a handkerchief— What then?
Why then ’tis hers, my lord, and, being hers, She may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.
She is protectress of her honor too.
May she give that?
