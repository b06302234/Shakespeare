Boatswain!
I’m here, sir.
How can I help you?
My good boy, give the other sailors a pep talk—and do it fast, before we’re shipwrecked.
Hurry, hurry!
Come on, men!
That’s the way to do it!
Quickly!
Quickly!
Take in the upper sail.
Listen to the master’s orders.
Blow your heart out, storm!
So long as we have enough room to avoid running aground!
Be careful, good Boatswain!
Where’s the Master?
Make these men work.
Please stay below deck, sir.
Where’s the Master, Boatswain?
