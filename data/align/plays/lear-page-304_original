Fall and cease.
This feather stirs.
She lives.
If it be so, It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt.
O my good master!
Prithee, away.
Tis noble Kent, your friend.
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
I might have saved her.
Now she’s gone for ever.— Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little.
Ha?
What is ’t thou say’st?—Her voice was ever soft, Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman.— I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee.
Tis true, my lords, he did.
Did I not, fellow?
I have seen the day with my good biting falchion I would have made them skip.
I am old now, And these same crosses spoil me.
Mine eyes are not o' th' best, I’ll tell you straight.
If Fortune brag of two she loved and hated, One of them we behold.
This a dull sight.
Are you not Kent?
The same.
Your servant Kent.
Where is your servant Caius?
