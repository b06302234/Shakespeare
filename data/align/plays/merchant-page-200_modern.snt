Find out where the Jew’s house is.
Give him this deed and have him sign it.
We’ll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back.
Lorenzo will be happy with what we’ve done.
I can’t have dinner with him.
Please tell him I accept his ring with thanks.
And could you please take my servant to old Shylock’s house?
I’ll do that.
