Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away.
You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before.
I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death.
Since you both grew up with him and are so familiar with his personality and behavior, I’m asking you to stay a while at court and spend some time with him.
See if you can get Hamlet to have some fun, and find out if there’s anything in particular that’s bothering him, so we can set about trying to fix it.
Gentlemen, Hamlet’s talked a lot about you, and I know there are no two men alive he’s fonder of.
If you’ll be so good as to spend some time with us and help us out, you’ll be thanked on a royal scale.
