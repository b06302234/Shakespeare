The mariners all under hatches stowed, Who, with a charm joined to their suffered labor, I have left asleep.
And for the rest o' th' fleet, Which I dispersed, they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float, Bound sadly home for Naples, Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wracked And his great person perish.
Ariel, thy charge Exactly is performed.
But there’s more work.
What is the time o' th' day?
Past the mid season.
At least two glasses.
The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously.
Is there more toil?
Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet performed me.
How now?
Moody?
What is ’t thou canst demand?
My liberty.
Before the time be out?
No more!
I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service, Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings.
Thou didst promise To bate me a full year.
