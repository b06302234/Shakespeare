Madam, although I speak it in your presence, You have a noble and a true conceit Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
But if you knew to whom you show this honor, How true a gentleman you send relief, How dear a lover of my lord your husband, I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you.
I never did repent for doing good, Nor shall not now; for in companions That do converse and waste the time together Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love, There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit, Which makes me think that this Antonio, Being the bosom lover of my lord, Must needs be like my lord.
If it be so, How little is the cost I have bestowed In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty!
This comes too near the praising of myself.
Therefore no more of it.
Hear other things.
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lordâ€™s return.
