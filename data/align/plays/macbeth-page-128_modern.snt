Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland?
He did, but Macduff told the messenger, “No way.” The messenger scowled and rudely turned his back on Macduff, as if to say, “You’ll regret the day you gave me this answer.” That might well keep Macduff away from Scotland.
Some holy angel should go to the court of England and give Macduff a message.
He should return quickly to free our country, which is suffering under a tyrant!
I’ll send my prayers with him.
