Would I could answer This comfort with the like.
But I have words That would be howled out in the desert air, Where hearing should not latch them.
What concern they?
The general cause, or is it a fee-grief Due to some single breast?
No mind thatâ€™s honest But in it shares some woe, though the main part Pertains to you alone.
If it be mine, Keep it not from me.
Quickly let me have it.
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard.
Hum!
I guess at it.
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered.
To relate the manner, Were, on the quarry of these murdered deer To add the death of you.
Merciful heaven!
What, man!
Ne'er pull your hat upon your brows.
Give sorrow words.
The grief that does not speak Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break.
My children too?
Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.
