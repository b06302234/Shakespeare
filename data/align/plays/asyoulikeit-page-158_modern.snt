But mistress, know yourself.
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man.
I’m telling you, as a friend, that you should sell while the market’s good—you’re not going to have many more buyers.
Ask this man’s forgiveness, love him, and accept his offer.
You’re already ugly, don’t make matters worse by being scornful, too.
So take her, shepherd, and God bless you.
Sweet boy, I’d rather hear you scold me for a whole year than this man woo me for a minute.
He’s fallen in love with your sheer ugliness.
I don’t wish you any harm.
I’m telling you, don’t fall in love with me.
I’m more false than the promises a man makes while drunk.
Besides, I don’t like you.
If you’d like to know where I live, my house is in the olive grove close by.
Come on, sister.
Shepherd, keep working on her.
Come on, sister.
Shepherdess, give him another chance.
And don’t be proud.
The whole world could look at you, and no one would be as blind as he is, thinking you’re beautiful.
Come on, to our sheep.
Dead
