No, no, Octavia, it’s not only that.
That would be excusable—that and a thousand other offenses like it.
But Caesar has gone and waged a new war against Pompey.
Oh, dear husband, don’t believe everything you hear—or if you must believe it, don’t let it all make you angry.
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree.
I’ll be left in the middle, praying for both sides.
The good gods will laugh at me when on the one hand I pray for my husband and on the other for my brother.
Let my husband win!” “Let my brother win!” One prayer cancels out the other.
There’s no middle ground between these two extremes.
Gentle Octavia, support the one that supports you.
If I’m defeated, I lose my reputation.
If I lose my reputation, I lose myself.
It would be better for you to have no husband than a husband who lacks honor.
However, as you requested, you may go and try to negotiate with your brother.
In the meantime, I’ll raise an army that will surpass his.
Go as soon as possible, so your prayers may be answered the sooner.
