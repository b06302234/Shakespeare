Forget about you, you worthless girl!
You disobedient wretch!
I’ll tell you what.
Go to church on Thursday or never look me in the face again.
Don’t say anything.
Don’t reply.
Don’t talk back to me.
I feel like slapping you.
Wife, we never thought ourselves blessed that God only gave us this one child.
But now I see that this one is one too many.
We were cursed when we had her.
She disgusts me, the little hussy!
God in heaven bless her!
My lord, you’re wrong to berate her like that.
And why, wise lady?
You shut up, old woman.
Go blabber with your gossiping friends.
I’ve said nothing wrong.
Oh, for God’s sake.
Can’t I say something?
Be quiet, you mumbling fool!
Say your serious things at lunch with your gossiping friends.
We don’t need to hear it.
You’re getting too angry.
Goddammit!
It makes me mad.
Day and night, hour after hour, all the time, at work, at play, alone, in company, my top priority has always been to find her a husband.
Now I’ve provided a husband from a noble family, who is good-looking, young, well-educated.
He’s full of good qualities.
He’s the man of any girl’s dreams.
But this wretched, whimpering fool, like a whining puppet, she looks at this good fortune and answers, “I won’t get married.
I can’t fall in love.
I’m too young.
Please, excuse me.” Well, if you won’t get married, I’ll excuse you.
Eat wherever you want, but you can no longer live under my roof.
Consider that.
Think about it.
I’m not in the habit of joking.
Thursday is coming.
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice.
If you act like my daughter, I’ll marry you to my friend.
If you don’t act like my daughter, you can beg, starve, and die in the streets.
I swear on my soul, I will never take you back or do anything for you.
Believe me.
Think about it.
I won’t break this promise.
