Romeo!
My baby hawk?
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you?
By nine o'clock.
I won’t fail.
From now until then seems like twenty years.
I have forgotten why I called you back.
Let me stand here until you remember your reason.
I’ll forget it, and you’ll have to stand there forever.
I’ll only remember how much I love your company.
I’ll keep standing here, even if you keep forgetting.
I’ll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here.
It’s almost morning.
I want to make you go, but I’d only let you go as far as a spoiled child lets his pet bird go.
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string.
I wish I was your bird.
My sweet, so do I.
But I would kill you by petting you too much.
Good night, good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I’ll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow.
