Death, traitor!
Nothing could have subdued nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
Judicious punishment!
Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters.
Pillicock sat on Pillicock hill.
Alow, alow, loo, loo!
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
Take heed o' th' foul fiend.
Obey thy parents, keep thy word’s justice, swear not, commit not with man’s sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on proud array.
Tom’s a- cold.
What hast thou been?
A servingman, proud in heart and mind, that curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the lust of my mistress' heart and did the act of darkness with her, swore as many oaths as I spake words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven—one that slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it.
Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman outparamoured the Turk.
False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand—hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman.
Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind, says, “Suum, mun, nonny.” Dauphin my boy, my boy, cessez.
Let him trot by.
