I do but keep the peace.
Put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me.
What, drawn, and talk of peace?
I hate the word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
Have at thee, coward!
Clubs, bills, and partisans!
Strike!
Beat them down!
Down with the Capulets!
Down with the Montagues!
What noise is this?
Give me my long sword, ho!
A crutch, a crutch!
Why call you for a sword?
My sword, I say!
Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
Thou villain Capulet!
Hold me not.
Let me go.
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
