And then he drew a dial from his poke And, looking on it with lackluster eye, Says very wisely, “It is ten o'clock.
Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.
Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.
And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, And then from hour to hour we rot and rot, And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time, My lungs began to crow like chanticleer That fools should be so deep-contemplative, And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial.
O noble fool!
A worthy fool!
Motley’s the only wear.
What fool is this?
O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier And says, “If ladies be but young and fair, They have the gift to know it.” And in his brain, Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed With observation, the which he vents In mangled forms.
Oh, that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
Thou shalt have one.
