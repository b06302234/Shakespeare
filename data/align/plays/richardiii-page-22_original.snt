Lady, you know no rules of charity, Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
Villain, thou know’st not law of God nor man.
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
O, wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman, Of these supposèd crimes to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself.
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man, Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to curse thy cursèd self.
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself.
By such despair I should accuse myself.
And by despairing shalt thou stand excused For doing worthy vengeance on thyself That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
