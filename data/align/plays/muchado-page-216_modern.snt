So that means she’ll come.
I’m really a pitiful singer.
But as a lover, well, that’s another story.
Take  Beatrice, have you come because I called for you?
Yes, sir, and I’ll leave when you ask me to.
Oh, well, stay till then!
There—you said “then.” So I’ll leave now.
But before I go, let me get what I came for.
What happened between you and Claudio?
I spoke angry, foul words to him, and with that I will kiss you.
