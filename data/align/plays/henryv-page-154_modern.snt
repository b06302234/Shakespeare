We shall, my liege.
Shall I accompany your Grace?
No, my good knight.
Go with my brothers to my English peers.
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don’t want any company.
The Lord in heaven bless you, noble Harry!
Bless you, old soul!
Your words cheer my heart.
A friend.
Declare yourself to me.
Are you an officer?
Or are you low, vulgar, and of the common people?
I am a gentleman of a company.
Do you carry a pike?
Exactly.
What about you?
I’m as good a gentleman as the emperor.
