Remember the reward we’re getting when the deed’s done.
Jesus, let’s kill him!
I forgot about the reward.
Where’s your conscience now?
Oh, in the duke of Gloucester’s wallet.
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay, your conscience will fly out?
It won’t matter.
Let it fly out.
No one will listen to it.
And what will you do if it returns to you?
I won’t bother with it.
Conscience makes a man a coward.
If he steals, it accuses him.
If he wants to swear, it restrains him.
If he sleeps with his neighbor’s wife, it exposes him.
It blushes, is easily embarrassed, and stages regular uprisings in a man’s heart.
It’s just too much trouble.
It once made me return a purse full of money that I found—it turns anyone who treats it decently into a beggar.
It has been thrown out of all sorts of towns and cities it visits, and anyone who wants to live well should learn to trust only himself and live without it.
My God, now the thing is at  Stop your conscience and don’t listen to him.
He wants to take over your thoughts and make you sad.
I’m strong-willed.
He won’t get the better of me.
