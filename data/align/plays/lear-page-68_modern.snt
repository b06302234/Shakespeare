Ingratitude is always hideous, but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster!
Please, sir, be patient.
My lord, I have no idea whatâ€™s upset you, but whatever it is, I had nothing to do with it.
That may be true, my lord.
Ah, dear Nature, my goddess, listen to me!
Change your plans if you ever intended for this woman to have children.
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her.
If she must give birth, make her child a bad seed who will torment her, give her a forehead wrinkled with worry, make her cry until her cheeks are sunken.
