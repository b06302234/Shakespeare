Oh God, whose side I think I’m fighting on, look kindly on my forces.
Fuel them with dangerous fury, so they can crush the enemy.
Make us your agents of revenge, so we can praise you when we’re victorious!
Before I fall asleep, I entrust my soul to you.
Defend me, God, both when I’m asleep and when I’m awake.
