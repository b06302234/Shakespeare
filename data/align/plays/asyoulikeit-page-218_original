And so am I for no woman.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
Why do you speak, too, “Why blame you me to love you?”?
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
Pray you, no more of this.
Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon.
I’ll not fail, if I live.
Nor I.
Nor I.
