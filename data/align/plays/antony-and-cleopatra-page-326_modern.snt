Listen to me, madam.
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable.
You are responding appropriately to the greatness of that loss.
I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now.
Thank you, sir.
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me?
I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew.
Please, sir— Though he is honorable— He’ll still parade me through Rome as a trophy of war.
I know he will, madam.
Stand aside for Caesar.
Which of these ladies is the Queen of Egypt?
Arise.
You need not kneel to me.
Please rise, Queen.
The gods have ordained it to be like this, sir.
You are my lord and master.
I must obey.
