What, with my tongue in your tail?
Nay, come again, Good Kate.
I am a gentleman.
That I’ll try.
I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again.
So may you lose your arms.
If you strike me, you are no gentleman; And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
A herald, Kate?
Oh, put me in thy books!
What is your crest?
A coxcomb?
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
No cock of mine.
You crow too like a craven.
Nay, come, Kate, come.
You must not look so sour.
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
Why, here’s no crab, and therefore look not sour.
There is, there is.
