I wish the sun would hurry up and set and night would come immediately.
When the night comes and everyone goes to sleep, Romeo will leap into my arms, and no one will know.
Beauty makes it possible for lovers to see how to make love in the dark.
Or else love is blind, and its best time is the night.
I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity.
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed.
In the darkness, let me, a shy virgin, learn the strange act of sex so that it seems innocent, modest, and true.
Come, night.
Come, Romeo.
You’re like a day that comes during the night.
You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven.
Come, gentle night.
Come, loving, dark night.
Give me my Romeo.
And when I die, turn him into stars and form a constellation in his image.
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun.
Oh, I have bought love’s mansion, but I haven’t moved in yet.I belong to Romeo now, but he hasn’t taken possession of me yet.
This day is so boring that I feel like a child on the night before a holiday, waiting to put on my fancy new clothes.
