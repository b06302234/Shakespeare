He was kind to me and took my side in the fight.
But then he said strange things to me.
He might be insane.
I don’t know what else it could be.
But you’re a famous pirate!
A master thief of the seas!
What made you stupid and careless enough to come visit the people you robbed and slaughtered?
Orsino, sir, please don’t call me those names.
I was never a thief or a pirate, though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons.
I came here because someone put a spell on me.
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning.
He was a wreck, almost past hope.
I saved his life and gave him my love, without reservation.
I dedicated myself to him.
For his sake I ran the risk of revisiting this unfriendly town, and I drew my sword to defend him when he was in trouble.
But when the police caught us, he was clever and treacherous enough to pretend he’d never met me before.
He acted like someone who barely knew me.
He refused to give me my own wallet, which I had lent him only half an hour before.
How is that possible?
