I’m more upset about not being able to help you than I am about what’s going to happen to me.
You look so confused.
Don’t worry about me.
Come on, sir, let’s go.
What money, sir?
I feel sorry for you in this situation, and I want to thank you for the kindness you’ve shown me here, so I’ll lend you some of my money, though I don’t have much.
I’ll give you half of everything I have right now.
Take this.
It’s half of all my money.
Are you really going to pretend you don’t know me now?
After everything I’ve done for you, you’re refusing to help me?
Don’t make me more miserable than I am.
I might do something really weak and unmanly, like listing the kind things I’ve done for you.
I don’t know any kind things you’ve done for me, and I don’t recognize your voice or your face.
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying, vanity, babbling, drunkenness, or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to.— Oh, my God!
Come on, sir, please.
Let’s go.
