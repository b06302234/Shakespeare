The thrice three Muses mourning for the death  Of learning, late deceased in beggary.” That is some satire, keen and critical, Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus  And his love Thisbe.
Very tragical mirth.” “Merry” and “tragical”?
Tedious” and “brief”?
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
How shall we find the concord of this discord?
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, Which is as brief as I have known a play.
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long, Which makes it tedious.
For in all the play There is not one word apt, one player fitted.
And tragical, my noble lord, it is.
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess, Made mine eyes water—but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed.
What are they that do play it?
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here, Which never labored in their minds till now, And now have toiled their unbreathed memories With this same play against your nuptial.
And we will hear it.
No, my noble lord.
It is not for you.
I have heard it over, And it is nothing, nothing in the world— Unless you can find sport in their intents, Extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain To do you service.
