Cry “holla” to thy tongue, I prithee.
It curvets unseasonably.
He was furnished like a hunter.
Oh, ominous!
He comes to kill my heart.
I would sing my song without a burden.
Thou bring’st me out of tune.
Do you not know I am a woman?
When I think, I must speak.
Sweet, say on.
You bring me out.
Soft, comes he not here?
Tis he.
Slink by, and note him.
I thank you for your company, but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.
And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.
God be wi' you.
Let’s meet as little as we can.
I do desire we may be better strangers.
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly.
