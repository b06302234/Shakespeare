Amen to that!
I can’t talk about my happiness anymore.
It’s too much.
I hope these kisses I’m about to give you are the closest we ever come to fighting.
Let’s go up to the castle.
Good news, friends.
The war’s over and the Turks are drowned.
How are my old friends from this island doing?—Honey, they’ll love you here in Cyprus.
They’ve been very good to me here.
Oh, my dear, I’m blabbing on and on because I’m so happy.—Iago, would you be good enough to go get my trunks from the ships?
And bring the ship’s captain to the castle.
He’s a good man.—Let’s go, Desdemona.
I’ll say it again: I’m so happy to see you here in Cyprus!
Meet me down at the harbor.—Come here.
They say love makes cowards brave.
So if you’re brave, listen to me.
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight.
But first, I have to tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with him.
