If we should fail?
We fail?
But screw your courage to the sticking-place, And we’ll not fail.
When Duncan is asleep— Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey Soundly invite him—his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory, the warder of the brain, Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep Their drenchèd natures lie as in a death, What cannot you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan?
What not put upon His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell?
Bring forth men-children only, For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males.
Will it not be received, When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers, That they have done ’t?
