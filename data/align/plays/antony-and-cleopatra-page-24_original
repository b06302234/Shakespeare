Fulvia is dead.
Sir?
Fulvia is dead.
Fulvia?
Dead.
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.
When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth, comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new.
If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented.
This grief is crowned with consolation.
Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence.
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode.
No more light answers.
Let our officers Have notice what we purpose.
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part.
For not alone The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home.
Sextus Pompeius Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands The empire of the sea.
Our slippery people, Whose love is never linked to the deserver Till his deserts are past, begin to throw Pompey the Great and all his dignities Upon his son, who—high in name and power, Higher than both in blood and life—stands up For the main soldier, whose quality, going on, The sides o’ th’ world may danger.
Much is breeding  Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life, And not a serpent’s poison.
Say our pleasure, To such whose place is under us, requires Our quick remove from hence.
