Nice vow, but what if she breaks it?
Madam, how are you liking this play?
The lady’s overdoing it, I think.
Oh, but she’ll keep her word.
Do you know the plot?
Is there anything offensive in it?
No, no, it’s just a joke, a little jibe but all in good fun.
Not offensive at all.
What’s the play called?
