Who’s the ruler here?
A duke who is noble in name and character.
What’s his name?
Orsino.
Orsino.
I’ve heard my father mention him.
When I first heard about him, he was still a bachelor.
He’s still a bachelor, or at least he was a month ago, when I left.
But there was a rumor—you know, people always gossip about royalty—that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia.
Who’s she?
A virtuous young woman, the daughter of a count who died last year.
Her brother had custody of her for a while, but then he died too.
They say she’s totally sworn off men now, in memory of her brother.
I wish I could work for that lady!
It’d be a good way to hide from the world until the time was right to identify myself.
That would be hard to do.
She won’t allow anyone in to see her, not even the duke’s messengers.
