I would not by my will have troubled you, But, since you make your pleasure of your pains, I will no further chide you.
I could not stay behind you.
My desire, More sharp than filèd steel, did spur me forth.
And not all love to see you, though so much As might have drawn one to a longer voyage, But jealousy what might befall your travel, Being skilless in these parts, which to a stranger, Unguided and unfriended, often prove Rough and unhospitable.
My willing love, The rather by these arguments of fear, Set forth in your pursuit.
My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks, and ever thanks.
And oft good turns Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.
But were my worth as is my conscience, firm, You should find better dealing.
What’s to do?
Shall we go see the relics of this town?
Tomorrow, sir.
Best first go see your lodging.
I am not weary, and ’tis long to night: I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes With the memorials and the things of fame That do renown this city.
