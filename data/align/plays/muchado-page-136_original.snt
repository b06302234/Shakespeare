By my troth, ’s but a nightgown in respect of yours—cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves, and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel.
But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on ’t.
God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is exceeding heavy.
Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.
Fie upon thee!
Art not ashamed?
Of what, lady?
Of speaking honorably?
Is not marriage honorable in a beggar?
Is not your lord honorable without marriage?
I think you would have me say, “Saving your reverence, a husband.” An bad thinking do not wrest true speaking, I’ll offend nobody.
Is there any harm in “the heavier for a husband”?
None, I think, an it be the right husband and the right wife.
Otherwise, ’tis light and not heavy.
Ask my Lady Beatrice else.
Here she comes.
Good morrow, coz.
Good morrow, sweet Hero.
