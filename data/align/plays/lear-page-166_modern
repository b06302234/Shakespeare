You’d be better off dead than facing the storm as naked as you are.
Is this all a human being is?
Look at him.
The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor, naked, two-legged animal like you.
Off with these clothes borrowed from animals!
Let me unbutton this.
Please calm down, uncle.
This is a nasty night to go swimming.
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man—a tiny spark in a cold body.
Look, here comes a walking fire.
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet.
He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn.
He can make your eyes squint and film over and give you a harelip.
He rots ripened wheat and hurts the poor creatures of the earth.
Saint Withold crossed the field three times, He met a she-demon and her nine kids, He told her to promise To stop doing harm.
And go away, witch, go away.
How are you, your highness?
Who are you?
What do you want?
