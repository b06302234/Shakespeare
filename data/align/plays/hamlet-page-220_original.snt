I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
He’s loved of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes.
And where ’tis so, th' offender’s scourge is weighed, But never the offense.
To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause.
Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved, Or not at all.
How now, what hath befall'n?
Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord, We cannot get from him.
But where is he?
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
Bring him before us.
Ho, Guildenstern!
Bring in my lord.
Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?
