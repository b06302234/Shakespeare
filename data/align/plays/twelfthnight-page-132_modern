Would it be better if I were that, instead of what I am?
I wish I were something better, because right now I’m a big fool.
And I swear by my youth and innocence that I’ve only got one heart and one love to give, and that I’ve never given them to a woman and never will.
So goodbye, my lady.
I won’t ever come to complain about my lord’s love for you again.
Then come again for another reason.
You might still be able to make yourself fall in love with me, the person he loves, even though you hate me now.
