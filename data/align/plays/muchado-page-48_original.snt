To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man.
Here’s his dry hand up and down.
You are he, you are he.

Graces will appear, and there’s an end.
Will you not tell me who told you so?
No, you shall pardon me.
Nor will you not tell me who you are?
Not now.

Well this was Signor Benedick that said so.
What’s he?
I am sure you know him well enough.
Not I, believe me.
Did he never make you laugh?
