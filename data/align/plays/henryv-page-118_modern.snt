Now that’s a mission worthy of great men!
I’m only sorry that his numbers are so few and those men he has sick and starving on the march.
When he sees our army, I’m sure his heart will sink with fear and he’ll offer us a large sum in exchange for avoiding battleof.
Have Montjoy hurry, then, Lord Constable, and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war.
Prince Dauphin, you’ll stay with me in Rouen.
No, please, I beg your Majesty.
Be patient, because you’re staying with me.
Go now, Lord Constable and all you princes, and quickly bring us news of England’s defeat.
