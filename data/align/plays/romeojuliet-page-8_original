How?
Turn thy back and run?
Fear me not.
No, marry.
I fear thee.
Let us take the law of our sides.
Let them begin.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
Nay, as they dare.
I will bite my thumb at them, which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
I do bite my thumb, sir.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Is the law of our side if I say “ay”?
No.
No, sir.
I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir.
Do you quarrel, sir?
Quarrel, sir?
No, sir.
