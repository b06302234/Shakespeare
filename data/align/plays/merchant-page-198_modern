There’s more to this ring than its cash value.
I’ll give you the most expensive ring in Venice, and I’ll make a public announcement to help me find it.
But as for this ring, please excuse me.
I see you like to make big offers, sir.
First you taught me how to beg, and now I think you’re teaching me how a beggar should be answered.
Good sir, this ring was given to me by my wife.
When she put it on my finger, she made me swear never to sell it, give it away, or lose it.
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts.
If your wife’s not a madwoman, and you tell her how much I deserve this ring, she won’t stay angry at you forever if you give it to me.
Well, anyway, goodbye.
Bassanio, let him have the ring.
Consider how much he deserves it, and weigh that, along with my friendship, against your wife’s order.
Come on, you and I will go soon.
Early in the morning we’ll both rush to Belmont.
Come on, Antonio.
