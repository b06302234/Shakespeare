Let’s put Goneril on trial first.
There she is.
I hereby swear before this honored assembly that she kicked her father when he was down.
Come here, ma'am.
Is your name Goneril?
She can’t deny it.
I’m so sorry, ma'am, I thought you were a good person, a well-made chair instead of a crude stool.
And here’s Regan, whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart.
Stop her!
Guards, guards, use your weapons.
Fire!
The courtroom is in chaos.
You corrupt judge, why did you let her escape?
Bless your heart.
Look at the three little dogs, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart—all barking at me.
Tom will chase them off.—Go away, you mongrels!
Whether you bite to kill, Mastiff, greyhound, or ugly mutt,
