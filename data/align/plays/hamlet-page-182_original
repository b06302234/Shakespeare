God bless you, sir.
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?
By th' mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
It is backed like a weasel.
Or like a whale.
Very like a whale.
Then I will come to my mother by and by.
I will say so.
By and by” is easily said.
Leave me, friends.
Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world.
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the bitter day Would quake to look on.
Soft, now to my mother.— O heart, lose not thy nature, let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
Let me be cruel, not unnatural.
