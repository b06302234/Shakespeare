But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you’re whining about your bad luck and your love.
Listen, listen, people who act like that die miserable.
Go be with your love, as it was decided at your wedding.
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her.
But get out of there before the night watchmen take their positions.
Then you will escape to the city of Mantua, where you’ll live until we can make your marriage public and make peace between your families.
We’ll ask the Prince to pardon you.
Then we’ll welcome you back with twenty thousand times more joy than you’ll have when you leave this town crying.
Go ahead, Nurse.
Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed.
I’m sure they’re all so sad that they’ll be ready to sleep.
Romeo is coming.
O Lord, I could stay here all night listening to such good advice.
Educated men are so impressive!
Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me.
Here, sir, this is a ring she asked me to give you.
Hurry up, it’s getting late.
This makes me feel so much better!
