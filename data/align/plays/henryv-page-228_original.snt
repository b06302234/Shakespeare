My Lord of Warwick, here is, praised be God for it, a most contagious treason come to light, look you, as you shall desire in a summer’s day.
Here is his Majesty.
How now, what’s the matter?
My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that, look your Grace, has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alençon.
My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow of it.
And he that I gave it to in change promised to wear it in his cap.
I promised to strike him if he did.
I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have been as good as my word.
Your Majesty, hear now, saving your Majesty’s manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy knave it is.
I hope your Majesty is pear me testimony and witness, and will avouchment that this is the glove of Alençon that your Majesty is give me, in your conscience now.
Give me thy glove, soldier.
Look, here is the fellow of it.
Twas I indeed thou promised’st to strike, And thou hast given me most bitter terms.
