May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction Plant neighborhood and Christian-like accord In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance His bleeding sword ’twixt England and fair France.
Amen.
Now welcome, Kate, and bear me witness all That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
God, the best maker of all marriages, Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one.
As man and wife, being two, are one in love, So be there ’twixt your kingdoms such a spousal That never may ill office or fell jealousy, Which troubles oft the bed of blessèd marriage, Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms To make divorce of their incorporate league, That English may as French, French Englishmen, Receive each other.
God speak this “amen”!
Amen.
Prepare we for our marriage; on which day, My Lord of Burgundy, we’ll take your oath, And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.
Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me, And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be.
