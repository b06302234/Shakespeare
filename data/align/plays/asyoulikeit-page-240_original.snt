And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage Is but for two months victualled.—So to your pleasures.
I am for other than for dancing measures.
Stay, Jaques, stay.
To see no pastime I.
What you would have I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.
Proceed, proceed.
We’ll so begin these rites As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.
