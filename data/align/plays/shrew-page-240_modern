Yes, and a nice one at that.
Pray God your wife doesn’t send you a worse one.
I’m hoping for better.
You there, Biondello, go and request that my wife come to me straight away.
Oh-ho, he  I rather think, sir, that yours will not grant a request in any case.
So, where’s my wife?
She says she thinks this is a prank.
She will not come.
She says that you should come to her.
Worse and worse!
She  I can guess her answer.
What?
She will not.
