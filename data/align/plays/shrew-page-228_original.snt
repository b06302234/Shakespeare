My cake is dough, but I’ll in among the rest, Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.
Husband, let’s follow to see the end of this ado.
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
What, in the midst of the street?
What, art thou ashamed of me?
No, sir, God forbid, but ashamed to kiss.
Why, then let’s home again.
Nay, I will give thee a kiss.
Is not this well?
Come, my sweet Kate.
Better once than never, for never too late.
