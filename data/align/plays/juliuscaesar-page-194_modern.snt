What!
Who goes there?
I think it’s my bad eyesight that’s making me see this horrible vision.
It’s coming toward me.
Are you real?
Are you a god, an angel, or a devil, that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up?
Tell me what you are.
I’m your evil spirit, Brutus.
Why do you come here?
To tell you that you’ll see me at Philippi.
Then I’ll see you again?
Yes, at Philippi.
Alright, then I’ll see you at Philippi.
Just as you go, I find the courage to talk to you.
Evil spirit, I want to talk some more.
Boy, Lucius!
Varrus!
Claudio!
Sirs, awake!
Claudio!
My lord, the strings are out of tune.
