Alack, poor gentleman!
Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?
Tis so.
They are afoot.
Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him.
Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.
When I am known aright you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance.
I pray you, go Along with me.
