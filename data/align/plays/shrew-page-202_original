Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome!
One mess is like to be your cheer.
Come, sir, we will better it in Pisa.
I follow you.
Cambio.
What sayest thou, Biondello?
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
Biondello, what of that?
Faith, nothing; but 'has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
I pray thee, moralize them.
Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.
And what of him?
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
And then?
The old priest at Saint Lukeâ€™s Church is at your command at all hours.
And what of all this?
