Is that the naked guy?
Yes, my lord.
But sir, he’s crazy.
It’s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind.
Do as I asked you.
Or rather, do what you feel like doing.
But above all, get out of here.
I’ll bring the crazy beggar the best clothes I have, no matter what happens.
Hey, naked guy— Poor Tom’s chilly.
Come here, man.
Do you know the way to Dover?
