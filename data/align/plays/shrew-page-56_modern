Petruchio, since the conversation’s gone this far, I may as well carry on with what I mentioned purely as a joke.
I can help you find a wife who’s rich, young, beautiful, and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman.
Her only flaw—and it’s a big one—is that she’s unbearable, a total witch, so much so that I wouldn’t think of marrying her myself, not even if I were in a worse fix than I am, not for a whole goldmine.
Hush, Hortensio.
You don’t know what money can buy.
Tell me her father’s name—that’s all I need.
I will go after her even if her scolding is as deafening as thunder in an autumn rainstorm.
Her father is Baptista Minola, a pleasant and courteous gentleman.
Her name is Katherina Minola, famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue.
I don’t know her, but I know her father and he knew mine well.
I won’t sleep until I see her, Hortensio.
So I hope you’ll forgive my cutting short this first conversation of ours—unless you want to come with me.
