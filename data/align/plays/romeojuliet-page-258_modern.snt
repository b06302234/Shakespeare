Brother, I’ll go and bring it to you.
Now I must go to the tomb alone.
Within three hours Juliet will wake up.
She’ll be very angry with me that Romeo doesn’t know what happened.
But I’ll write again to Mantua, and I’ll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes.
That poor living corpse.
She’s shut inside a dead man’s tomb!
