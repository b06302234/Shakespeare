Fear me not, man.
I will not break away: I’ll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money, To warrant thee, as I am ’rested for.
My wife is in a wayward mood today And will not lightly trust the messenger That I should be attached in Ephesus.
I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears.
Here comes my man.
I think he brings the money.
How now, sir?
Have you that I sent you for?
Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
But where’s the money?
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
I’ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
To a rope’s end, sir, and to that end am I returned.
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
