I will too.
You’re made of air, so if even you feel sorry for them, imagine the pity that I’ll feel, being one of their own human race.
I suffer pain just as much as they do, so I’ll sympathize far more than you.
Though I’m indignant about their evil deeds, I’ll go with my nobler instincts, which tell me to feel some compassion for them.
It’s better to act virtuously rather than vengefully.
Now that they’re sorry, I don’t want anything more.
Go release them, Ariel.
I’ll break my spells and bring them back to their senses, and they’ll feel like themselves again.
I’ll go get them, sir.
