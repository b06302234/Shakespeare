But the country was more frightened than hurt, my liege.
Take this example: when all its knights have been in France and all its noblemen absent, England has not only defended itself well, but actually seized the Scottish king and penned him up like a stray dog.
Then he was sent off to France.
He enhanced King Edward’s fame, adding royalty to his captives and thus making England’s own history as rich with glory as the muddy floor of the sea is rich with sunken ships and innumerable treasures.
But here’s an old, true saying: “If you want to win France, start with Scotland.” For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey, the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and, like the mouse when the cat’s away, destroy more than she can actually eat.
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home.
But that is a false conclusion, since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves.
While the armed hand fights in foreign lands, the wise head defends itself at home.
For though the state is divided into different levels and functions, it all works in agreement for a unified purpose, a natural and perfect end such as we find in music.
