We’ve driven him all the way back to his camp.
One of you run to the Queen with the news.
Before sunrise tomorrow, we’ll kill anyone who escaped today.
I want to thank all of you.
You’re formidable.
You fought not as if you served the cause but as though it were as much your personal fight as mine.
You are all    Lord of lords!
Your courage is infinite.
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world?
