Such duty to the drunkard let him do With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy, And say, “What is ’t your Honor will command, Wherein your lady and your humble wife May show her duty and make known her love?” And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses, And with declining head into his bosom, Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed To see her noble lord restored to health, Who for this seven years hath esteemed him No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
And if the boy have not a woman’s gift To rain a shower of commanded tears, An onion will do well for such a shift, Which in a napkin being close conveyed Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst: Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.
I know the boy will well usurp the grace, Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.
I long to hear him call the drunkard “husband,” And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant.
I’ll in to counsel them.
Haply my presence May well abate the over-merry spleen Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
