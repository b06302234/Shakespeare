Where is he?
I did not see him since.
I did not send you.
If you find him sad, Say I am dancing.
If in mirth, report That I am sudden sick.
Quick, and return.
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly, You do not hold the method to enforce The like from him.
What should I do I do not?
In each thing give him way.
Cross him in nothing.
Thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him.
Tempt him not so too far.
I wish, forbear.
In time we hate that which we often fear.
But here comes Antony.
I am sick and sullen.
I am sorry to give breathing to my purposeâ€” Help me away, dear Charmian!
I shall fall.
It cannot be thus long.
The sides of nature Will not sustain it.
