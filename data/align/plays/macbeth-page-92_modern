My lord, I’ve been so kicked around by the world, and I’m so angry, that I don’t even care what I do.
I’m the same.
I’m so sick of bad luck and trouble that I’d risk my life on any bet, as long as it would either fix my life or end it once and for all.
You both know Banquo was your enemy.
It’s true, my lord.
He’s my enemy too, and I hate him so much that every minute he’s alive it eats away at my heart.
Since I’m king, I could simply use my power to get rid of him.
But I can’t do that, because he and I have friends in common whom I need, so I have to be able to moan and cry over his death in public even though I’ll be the one who had him killed.
That’s why I need your help right now.
I have to hide my real plans from the public eye for many important reasons.
