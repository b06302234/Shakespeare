He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves—wait a minute there, Morocco, and consider your own value with a level head.
If your reputation is trustworthy, you deserve a lot—though maybe not enough to include this lady.
But fearing I don’t deserve her is a way of underestimating myself.
As much as I deserve—I deserve Portia!
By birth I deserve her.
In terms of wealth, talents, and upbringing, and especially love, I deserve her.
What if I went no further and chose this one?
But let’s see once more what the gold one says: “He who chooses me will get what many men want.” That’s Portia!
The whole world wants her.
They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living, breathing saint.
Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia.
The wide ocean doesn’t prevent them from coming to see her—they travel across it as if it were a little stream.
One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture.

Oh, what a sinful thought!
Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold.
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel, but that’s just engraved on the surface.
