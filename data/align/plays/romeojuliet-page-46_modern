Madam, the guests are here, dinner is served, people are calling for you, people have asked for Juliet, and in the pantry, people are cursing the Nurse.
Everything’s out of control.
I must go and serve the guests.
Please, follow straight after me.
We’ll follow you.
Juliet, the count is waiting for you.
Go, girl, look for a man who’ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days.
