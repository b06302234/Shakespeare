Signor Bassanio!
Gratiano!
I have a suit to you.
You have obtained it.
You must not deny me.
I must go with you to Belmont.
Why, then you must.
But hear thee, Gratiano.
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice— Parts that become thee happily enough And in such eyes as ours appear not faults.
But where thou art not known, why, there they show Something too liberal.
Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior I be misconst’red in the place I go to, And lose my hopes.
Signor Bassanio, hear me.
If I do not put on a sober habit, Talk with respect and swear but now and then, Wear prayer books in my pocket, look demurely— Nay more.
While grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh and say, “Amen”— Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam, never trust me more.
Well, we shall see your bearing.
Nay, but I bar tonight.
You shall not gauge me By what we do tonight.
