What do we have here, a man or a fish?
Whew, he stinks like a fish—an old salted fish, not a fresh-caught one.
A strange fish.
If I were in England now, like I was once, and I had even a painted picture of this fish, every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it.
In England this strange monster would be just like a man.
Any strange beast there can be considered a man.
The men there won’t give a penny to a lame beggar, but they’ll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit.
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms!
And he’s still warm, by God.
I guess this is not a fish, but a native who got struck by lightning just now.
Oh, here comes the storm again.
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak.
There’s no other shelter around here.
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks.
I’ll just stay here till the storm passes.
This is a rotten song to sing at a man’s funeral.
At least I’ve got some booze to comfort me.
