Troth, no, no more than reason.
Why then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.
They swore that you were almost sick for me.
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
Tis no such matter.
Then you do not love me?
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
And I’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her, For here’s a paper written in his hand, A halting sonnet of his own pure brain, Fashioned to Beatrice.
And here’s another, Writ in my cousin’s hand, stol'n from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick.
A miracle!
Here’s our own hands against our hearts.
Come, I will have thee, but, by this light, I take thee for pity.
I would not deny you, but, by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption.
Peace!
I will stop your mouth.
