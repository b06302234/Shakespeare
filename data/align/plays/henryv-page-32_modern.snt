such glory that I’ll dazzle all the eyes of France.
I’ll shine so brightly that even the Dauphin will be struck blind.
And tell the laughing prince that this joke of his has transformed his tennis balls into cannon balls, and the destructive vengeance they bring with them will be his responsibility.
His mocking will mock many thousands of widows out of their husbands.
It will mock mothers out of their sons, and mock castles down.
There are people yet unborn and unconceived who will have reason to curse the Dauphin’s scorn.
But all this lies with God, to whom I do appeal.
In God’s name, inform the Dauphin I am coming, to avenge myself and to put forth my rightful hand in a sanctified cause.
So go in peace.
And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it.
That was a humorous message.
