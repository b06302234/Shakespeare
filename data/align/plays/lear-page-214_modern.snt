What news do you bring?
Oh my lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead.
He was killed by his servant as he about to gouge out Glouces-ter’s other eye.
Gloucester’s eyes?
A servant Gloucester had raised in his house, full of compunction, opposed the blinding and turned his sword on the Duke of Cornwall.
Enraged, Cornwall attacked and killed the servant, but not without receiving his own wound, of which he later died.
There’s justice in heaven after all!
That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof.
But oh, poor Glou-cester!
Did he lose his other eye?
He lost both, my lord.—Ma'am, this letter is from your sister, and needs an immediate answer.
