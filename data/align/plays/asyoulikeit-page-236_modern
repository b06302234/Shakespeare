My niece, you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter.
Let me have your attention for a moment.
I’m Sir Rowland’s middle son, and I bring you news.
When Duke Frederick heard that great, worthy men were coming to this forest every day, he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother.
But just at the edge of the forest, he met an old religious man.
He spoke with him for a while and decided not only to abandon his pursuit of his brother but even to retreat from the world.
He’s giving the throne to his banished brother and restoring all the men he’d exiled to their rightful lands.
I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth.
