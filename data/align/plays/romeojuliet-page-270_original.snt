Saint Francis be my speed!
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves!—Who’s there?
Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Bliss be upon you!
Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls?
As I discern, It burneth in the Capels' monument.
It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master, One that you love.
Who is it?
Romeo.
How long hath he been there?
Full half an hour.
Go with me to the vault.
I dare not, sir.
My master knows not but I am gone hence, And fearfully did menace me with death If I did stay to look on his intents.
Stay, then.
I’ll go alone.
Fear comes upon me.
Oh, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
