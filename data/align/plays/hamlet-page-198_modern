You low-life, nosy, busybody fool, goodbye.
I thought you were somebody more important.
You’ve gotten what you deserve.
I guess you found out it’s dangerous to be a busybody.
What have I done that you dare to talk to me so rudely?
A deed that destroys modesty, turns virtue into hypocrisy, replaces the blossom on the face of true love with a nasty blemish, makes marriage vows as false as a gambler’s oath—oh, you’ve done a deed that plucks the soul out of marriage and turns religion into meaningless blather.
Heaven looks down on this earth, as angry as if Judgment Day were here, and is sick at the thought of what you’ve done.
C’mon, what’s this deed that sounds so awful even before I know what it is?
Look at this picture here, and that one there,  A figure and a combination of good qualities that seemed like every god had set his stamp on this man.
