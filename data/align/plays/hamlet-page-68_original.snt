It is “Adieu, adieu.
Remember me.” I have sworn ’t.
My lord, my lord!
Lord Hamlet— Heaven secure him!
So be it.
Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
Hillo, ho, ho, boy.
Come, bird, come.
How is ’t, my noble lord?
What news, my lord?
Oh, wonderful!
Good my lord, tell it.
No.
You’ll reveal it.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Nor I, my lord.
How say you, then?
Would heart of man once think it?
But you’ll be secret?
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
