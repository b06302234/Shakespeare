I never saw my father in my life.
You know that we parted only seven years ago, in Syracuse.
Maybe you’re ashamed to admit that you know me because I’m a prisoner now.
The duke and everyone who knows me in this city can confirm that’s not true.
I’ve never been to Syracuse in my life.
I tell you, Syracusian.
I’ve been looking after Antipholus for twenty years, and during that time he’s never been to Syracuse.
Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things.
Mighty duke, look here and see a man who’s been treated most terribly!
Either my eyes deceive me, or I see two husbands.
I, sir, am Dromio.
Command this man to leave.
