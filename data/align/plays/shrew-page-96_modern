Show me.
I would, if I had a mirror.
What, you mean my face looks like a crab-apple?
What a clever child he is!
You know, you’re right.
I probably am too young for you.
Maybe, but you’re wrinkled all the same.
Oh, that’s with worry.
Well, that doesn’t worry me.
Listen, Kate!
You won’t get away like that.
Let me go.
I’ll make you angry if I stay.
No, not a bit.
I find you quite gentle.
I was told that you were violent, proud, and sullen.
But now I see that people have been lying about you, for you are funny, playful, and beautifully behaved, not sharp-tongued, but as sweet as flowers in springtime.
You haven’t got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do.
You don’t take pleasure in bitter conversation.
No, you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation, quiet and pleasant.
Why does the world report that Kate is lame?
