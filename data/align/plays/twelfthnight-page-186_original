Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o'er the house.
Nay, let him alone.
I’ll go another way to work with him.
I’ll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria.
Though I struck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.
Come, sir, I will not let you go.
Come, my young soldier, put up your iron.
You are well fleshed.
Come on.
I will be free from thee.
