Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men?
As Caesar loved me, I weep for him.
As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it.
As he was valiant, I honor him.
But, as he was ambitious, I slew him.
There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition.
Who is here so base that would be a bondman?
If any, speak—for him have I offended.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman?
If any, speak—for him have I offended.
Who is here so vile that will not love his country?
If any, speak—for him have I offended.
I pause for a reply.
None, Brutus, none.
Then none have I offended.
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol.
His glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not?
With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death.
Live, Brutus!
Live, live!
Bring him with triumph home unto his house!
