Service.
Who wouldst thou serve?
You.
Dost thou know me, fellow?
No, sir.
But you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master.
What’s that?
Authority.
What services canst thou do?
I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly.
That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in.
And the best of me is diligence.
How old art thou?
Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything.
I have years on my back forty- eight.
Follow me.
Thou shalt serve me.
If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.—Dinner, ho, dinner!
Where’s my knave, my fool?—Go you, and call my fool hither.
