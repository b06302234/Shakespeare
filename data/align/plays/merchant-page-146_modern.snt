Madam, I hope you don’t mind my saying that I admire your noble respect for friendship, which you show in letting your husband go off to help his friend like this.
If you only knew the man you’re helping out, and what a faithful gentleman he is and how much he loves your husband, I know you’d be even prouder of your kindness than you normally might be.
I’ve never regretted doing good, and I don’t now.
Friends who spend a lot of time together and really care equally for each other must have many traits in common.
Since Antonio’s my husband’s best friend, they must be very similar men.
In that case, the money I’ve sent is a small price to pay to rescue someone who resembles my Bassanio, who’s like my own soul.—Anyway, let’s change the subject, since I feel like I’m starting to flatter myself.
I have a favor to ask of you.
Lorenzo, please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back.
