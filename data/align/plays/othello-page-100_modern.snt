Damn you, you villain, you rascal!
What’s the matter, lieutenant?
To think that fool had the nerve to try to teach me manners!
I’ll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave!
You’ll beat me?
Are you talking, you villain?
No, don’t hit him, lieutenant!
Please, sir, restrain yourself.
Let me go, or I’ll knock you on the head.
Come on, you’re drunk.
Drunk?
No, lieutenant—God, gentlemen—Help—Lieutenant—sir, Montano—Help, men!—The night guard is coming!
