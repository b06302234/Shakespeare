For use almost can change the stamp of nature, And either rein the devil or throw him out With wondrous potency.
Once more, good night, And when you are desirous to be blessed, I’ll blessing beg of you.
For this same lord, I do repent.
But heaven hath pleased it so, To punish me with this and this with me, That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him and will answer well The death I gave him.
So, again, good night.
I must be cruel only to be kind.
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
One word more, good lady— What shall I do?
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do— Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed, Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse, And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses Or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers, Make you to ravel all this matter out: That I essentially am not in madness But mad in craft.
Twere good you let him know, For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide?
Who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house’s top.
Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape, To try conclusions, in the basket creep And break your own neck down.
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath And breath of life, I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me.
