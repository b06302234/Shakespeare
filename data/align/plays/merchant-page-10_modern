All right, we’ll see you at dinnertime.
I must be one of these silent so-called wise men Gratiano’s talking about, because he never lets me get a word in.
If you hang around me for two more years, you’ll forget the sound of your own voice.
I won’t ever let you speak.
Goodbye.
After that lecture of yours, I’ll start talking a lot.
Thank you.
The only tongues that should be silent are ox-tongues on a dinner plate and those that belong to old maids.
Is he right?
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice.
His point is always like a needle in a haystack—you look for it all day, and when you find it you realize it wasn’t worth the trouble.
So, who’s this girl, the one you said you were going to take a special trip for?
You promised to tell me.
Antonio, you know how bad my finances have been lately.
I’ve been living way beyond my means.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not complaining about having to cut back.
