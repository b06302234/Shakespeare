Proceed, Moon.
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thornbush, my thornbush; and this dog, my dog.
Why, all these should be in the lanthorn, for all these are in the moon.—But silence!
Here comes Thisbe.
This is old Ninny’s tomb.
Where is my love?
Well roared, Lion!
Well run, Thisbe!
Well shone, Moon!—Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.
Well moused, Lion!
