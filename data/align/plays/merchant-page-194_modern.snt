He must do this, or I’ll recant the pardon I just delivered.
Are you satisfied, Jew?
What do you say?
I’m satisfied.
Please let me go.
I’m not well.
Send the deed after me and I’ll sign it.
Go, but sign the deed.
I’m very sorry, sir, but I have to go to Padua tonight.
I should really leave right away.
I’m sorry you don’t have time.—Antonio, give this gentleman a reward.
In my opinion, you owe him a lot.
