Come hither, fellow.
Which way hast thou been?
At mine own house, good lady.
What is ’t o'clock?
About the ninth hour, lady.
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
Madam, not yet.
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol.
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
That I have, lady.
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me, I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
Why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?
None that I know will be; much that I fear may chance.
Good morrow to you.
Here the street is narrow.
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, Of senators, of praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I’ll get me to a place more void, and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
