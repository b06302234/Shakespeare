Please go, sir.
My new master is expecting your approach.
And I’m expecting his reproach.
And they’ve been plotting things together.
I’m not saying you’ll get a masquerade party, but if you do, I predicted it.
I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday, at six in the morning, four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday, in the afternoon.
What, there’s going to be a masquerade?
Listen to me, Jessica, lock my doors up, and when you hear the drum and the nasty squealing of the flute, don’t climb up to the windows.
Don’t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces.
Block up my house’s ears—I mean the windows.
Don’t let the noise of shallow fools enter my serious house.
I swear, I’m in no mood to go out to dinner tonight, but I’ll go anyway.—Launcelot, go tell them I’ll come.
I’ll go ahead of you, sir.
