Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?
News have I that my Nell is dead i' th' spital Of a malady of France, And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
Old I do wax, and from my weary limbs Honor is cudgeled.
Well, bawd I’ll turn, And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.
To England will I steal, and there I’ll steal.
And patches will I get unto these cudgeled scars, And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.
