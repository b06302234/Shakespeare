Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
He shift a  trencher?
He scrape a trencher!
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwashed too, ’tis a foul thing.
Away with the joint-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate.
Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.—Antony and Potpan!
Ay, boy, ready.
You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.
We cannot be here and there too.
Cheerly, boys.
Be brisk 0awhile, and the longer liver take all.
Welcome, gentlemen!
Ladies that have their toes Ah, my mistresses!
Which of you all Unplagued with corns will walk a bout with you.— Will now deny to dance?
She that makes dainty, She, I’ll swear, hath corns.
Am I come near ye now?— Welcome, gentlemen!
I have seen the day That I have worn a visor and could tell A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear Such as would please.
Tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone.— You are welcome, gentlemen.—Come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall, give room!—And foot it, girls.— More light, you knaves!
And turn the tables up, And quench the fire.
The room is grown too hot.— Ah, sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes well.— Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet, For you and I are past our dancing days.
How long is ’t now since last yourself and I Were in a mask?
