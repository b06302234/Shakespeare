What, up and down, carved like an apple tart?
Here’s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash, Like to a censer in a barber’s shop.
Why, what i' devil’s name, tailor, call’st thou this?
You bid me make it orderly and well, According to the fashion and the time.
Marry, and did.
But if you be remembered, I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home, For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
I’ll none of it.
Hence, make your best of it.
I never saw a better-fashioned gown, More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable.
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
Why, true, he means to make a puppet of thee.
She says your Worship means to make a puppet of her.
O monstrous arrogance!
Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble, Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter cricket thou!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant, Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv’st!
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marred her gown.
