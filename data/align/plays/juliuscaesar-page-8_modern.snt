Calphurnia!
Quiet!
Caesar’s talking.
Calphurnia!
I’m here, my lord.
Stand right in Antonius’s path when he runs the race.
Antonius!
Yes, Caesar?
Antonius, after you take off, don’t forget to touch Calphurnia, because our wise elders say that if you touch an infertile woman during this holy race, she’ll be freed from the curse of sterility.
I’ll remember.
When Caesar says “do this,” it is done.
Continue, then, and don’t forget to perform all of the rituals.
Caesar!
