Who could think it happened any other way?
We’ll be grieving loudly when we hear that Duncan has died.
Now I’m decided, and I will exert every muscle in my body to commit this crime.
Go now, and pretend to be a friendly hostess.
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false, evil heart.
