Nay, that’s not next—Hark!
Who is ’t that knocks?
It’s the wind.
If I court more women you’ll couch with more men— So, get thee gone, good night.
Mine eyes do itch, Doth that bode weeping?
Tis neither here nor there.
I have heard it said so.
Oh, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think—tell me, Emilia— That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind?
There be some such, no question.
