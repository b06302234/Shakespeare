More, more, I prithee, more.
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
I thank it.
More, I prithee, more.
I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs.
More, I prithee, more.
My voice is ragged.
I know I cannot please you.
I do not desire you to please me.
I do desire you to sing.
Come, more, another stanzo.
Call you 'em “stanzos”?
What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
Nay, I care not for their names.
They owe me nothing.
Will you sing?
