A case study in madness, to connect memory and thought.
Sadness and torment, suffering, hell itself—she makes them almost pretty.
And on the souls of all good Christians, I hope.
Goodbye, God be with you.
Do you see this, oh, God?
Laertes, I have a right to share your grief.
Go choose your wisest friends, and have them listen to both of us and decide which of us is right.
If directly or indirectly they find me implicated in your father’s murder, I’ll give up my kingdom, my crown, my life, and everything I call my own to you as restitution.
But if they find me innocent, then be patient and I’ll work to satisfy to the fullest extent your deepest need for revenge.
