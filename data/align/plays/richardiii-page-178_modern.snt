Now, noble lords, the reason we’re meeting is to determine the day the prince will be crowned.
In God’s name, speak.
When should the royal day be?
Is everything ready for that event?
It is.
All we have to do is name the day.
Tomorrow’s a good day.
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks?
Who’s closest to him?
You, I think, would best know what he’s thinking.
We know each other’s faces, but as for our thoughts, he doesn’t know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his—or you do about mine.
Lord Hastings, you and he are close.
Thank you.
I know he holds me dear, but I haven’t asked him about the coronation, and he hasn’t told me.
But you, my noble lords, may name a time, and I’ll second it on the duke’s behalf, which I don’t think he’ll mind.
