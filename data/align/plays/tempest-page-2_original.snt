Boatswain!
Here, master.
What cheer?
Good, speak to th' mariners.
Fall to ’t yarely, or we run ourselves aground.
Bestir, bestir.
Heigh, my hearts!
Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
Yare!
Yare!
Take in the topsail.—Tend to th' master’s whistle.—Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!
Good Boatswain, have care.
Where’s the Master?
Play the men.
I pray now, keep below.
Where is the Master, Boatswain?
