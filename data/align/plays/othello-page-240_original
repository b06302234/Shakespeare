Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before.
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
It hath not appeared.
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment.
But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever—I mean purpose, courage and valor—this night show it.
If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.
Well, what is it?
Is it within reason and compass?
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.
Is that true?
Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
Oh, no, he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident—wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
How do you mean, removing of him?
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.
And that you would have me to do!
