Abhorrèd slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill!
I pitied thee, Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour One thing or other.
When thou didst not, savage, Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes With words that made them known.
But thy vile race, Though thou didst learn, had that in ’t which good natures Could not abide to be with.
Therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock, Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
You taught me language, and my profit on ’t Is I know how to curse.
The red plague rid you For learning me your language!
Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel.
And be quick, thou 'rt best, To answer other business.
Shrug’st thou, malice?
If thou neglect’st or dost unwillingly What I command, I’ll rack thee with old cramps, Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
No, pray thee.
It would control my dam’s god, Setebos, And make a vassal of him.
So, slave, hence!
