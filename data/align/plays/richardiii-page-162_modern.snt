A messenger from Lord Stanley.
Four o'clock in the morning.
Can’t Lord Stanley sleep?
I guess not—for good reason, as you’ll soon hear.
First, he sends his regards.
And then?
And then he said to tell you that tonight he dreamed the duke of Gloucester cut off his helmet—that is, his head.
Besides that, he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow, and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him, who are at the other, sorry.
He wants to know if instead of going to the meeting, you’ll get on your horse and ride north with him to get out of harm’s way.
