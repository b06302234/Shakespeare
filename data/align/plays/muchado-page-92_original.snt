sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady.
It seems her affections have their full bent.
Love me?
Why, it must be requited!
I hear how I am censured.
They sy I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her.
They say, too, that she will rather die than give any sign of affection.
I did never think to marry.
I must not seem proud.
Happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending.
They say the lady is fair; ’tis a truth, I can bear them witness.
And virtuous; ’tis so, I cannot reprove it.
And wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her!
I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage, but doth not the appetite alter?
A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor?
No!
The world must be peopled.
When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married.
Here comes Beatrice.
By this day, she’s a fair lady.
I do spy some marks of love in her.
Against my will, I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
