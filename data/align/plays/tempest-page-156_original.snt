This is a most majestic vision, and Harmonious charmingly.
May I be bold To think these spirits?
Spirits, which by mine art I have from their confines called to enact My present fancies.
Let me live here ever.
So rare a wondered father and a wife Makes this place paradise.
Sweet now, silence.
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously.
Thereâ€™s something else to do.
Hush and be mute, Or else our spell is marred.
You nymphs, called naiads of the windring brooks, With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks, Leave your crisp channels and on this green land Answer your summons, Juno does command.
