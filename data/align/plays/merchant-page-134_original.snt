So do I, my lord.
They are entirely welcome.
My purpose was not to have seen you here.
But meeting with Salerio by the way, He did entreat me, past all saying nay, To come with him along.
I did, my lord.
And I have reason for it.
Signor Antonio Commends him to you.
Ere I ope his letter, I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind, Nor well, unless in mind.
His letter there Will show you his estate.
Nerissa, cheer yond stranger.
Bid her welcome.— Your hand, Salerio.
What’s the news from Venice?
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
I know he will be glad of our success.
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
