I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love.
I think so too.
But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them.
Octavia has a pious, chaste, meek disposition.
Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that?
Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition, meaning Mark Antony.
He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish.
Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that brought them together will part them.
Antony will go where his passion is.
He only married out of political necessity.
Then that’s the way it may turn out.
Come on, sir, will you come aboard?
I want to drink your health.
I’ll join you, sir.
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt.
Let’s go.
