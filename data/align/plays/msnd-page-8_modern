I’d rather wither away than give up my virginity to someone I don’t love.
Take some time to think about this.
By the time of the next new moon—the day when Hippolyta and I will be married—be ready either to be executed for disobeying your father, to marry Demetrius as your father wishes, or to take a vow to spend the rest of your life as a virgin priestess of the moon goddess.
Please give in, sweet Hermia.—And Lysander, stop acting like she’s yours.
I’ve got more of a right to her than you do.
Her father loves you, Demetrius.
So why don’t you marry him and let me have Hermia?
It’s true, rude Lysander, I do love him.
That’s why I’m giving him my daughter.
She’s mine, and I’m giving her to Demetrius.
