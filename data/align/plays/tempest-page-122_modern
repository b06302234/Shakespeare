Monster sweetie, be a good monster and just speak once.
How is your Highness?
Let me lick your shoe.
Lord,” he calls you?
What an idiot that monster is!
Trinculo, speak politely.
If you mutiny against me, I’ll hang you from the next tree.
This poor monster is my subject, and I will not allow him to be insulted.
Thank you, my noble lord.
Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier?
Indeed, I will.
Kneel and tell me again.
I’ll stand, and so will Trinculo.
