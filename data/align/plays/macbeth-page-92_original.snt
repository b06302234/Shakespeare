I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.
And I another So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune, That I would set my life on any chance, To mend it or be rid on ’t.
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy.
True, my lord.
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near’st of life.
And though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not, For certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall Who I myself struck down.
And thence it is, That I to your assistance do make love, Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons.
