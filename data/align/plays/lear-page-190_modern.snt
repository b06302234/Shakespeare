Tie him up harder.—You filthy traitor!
I’m not a traitor, unfair lady.
Tie him to this chair.—You’ll see, criminal— By the gods, it’s disgraceful for you to pull my beard.
As old and white-haired as you are, and you’re such a traitor?

What do you think you’re doing?
Tell us about the letters that you got from France.
Get to the point, since we already know the truth.
And what’s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently?
The ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to.
Tell us.
I got a letter that made some guesses about what was going on, without any proof.
It came from a neutral party, not from someone opposed to you.
How clever of you.
