Good to see you, Signior Hortensio.
Do you know where I’m going?
To Baptista Minola’s house.
I promised to look into schoolmasters for Miss Bianca, and luck has led me to this young man, perfectly suited in learning and fine manners, well read in poetry and other books—all of them good, I assure you.
That’s great.
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love.
I wouldn’t want to fall behind in my devotion to my beloved Bianca.
Gremio, this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca.
Be nice and listen to me a moment, and I’ll give you a piece of news that’s equally good for both of us.
