Gentlemen, stand up.
His highness is not well.
Sit down, worthy friends.
My husband is often like this, and he has been since he was a child.
Please stay seated.
This is just a brief fit.
In a moment he’ll be well again.
If you pay too much attention to him you’ll make him angry, and that will make his convulsions go on longer.
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him.
Yes, and a brave one, who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil.
Oh, that’s nonsense!
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid.
This is like that floating dagger you said was leading you toward Duncan.
These outbursts of yours don’t even look like real fear.
They’re more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother.
Shame on you!
Why are you making these faces?
When the vision passes, you’ll see that you’re just looking at a stool.
Please, just look over there.
Look!
Look!
See!
What, has your foolishness paralyzed you completely?
