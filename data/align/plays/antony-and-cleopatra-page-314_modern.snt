I will, Caesar.
Gallus, you go with him.
Where’s Dolabella?
He’s supposed to support Proculeius.
Dolabella!
Never mind.
I remember he’s already occupied.
He’ll be done in time.
Come with me.
In my tent I’ll show you how unwillingly I was drawn into this war.
You’ll see how calm and gentle my letters to Antony always were.
Come and see the proof.
