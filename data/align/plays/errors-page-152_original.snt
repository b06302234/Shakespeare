Why look you strange on me?
you know me well.
I never saw you in my life till now.
O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last, And careful hours with time’s deformèd hand Have written strange defeatures in my face.
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
Neither.
Dromio, nor thou?
No, trust me, sir, nor I. I am sure thou dost.
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
Not know my voice!
O time’s extremity, Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Though now this grainèd face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow, And all the conduits of my blood froze up, Yet hath my night of life some memory, My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, My dull deaf ears a little use to hear.
All these old witnesses—I cannot err— Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
