What, that’s all?
Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt.
I’d pay twelve thousand before I’d let a friend like that suffer in the slightest because of you.
First come with me to church to get married.
Then you can leave for Venice to see your friend.
You have to go, because you’ll never sleep next to me peacefully without settling this.
I’ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over.
When it’s paid, bring your friend back.
Until you get back, Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows.
Come on, let’s go, because you’re going to leave me the same day we get married.
Put on a happy face, and welcome your friends.
Since it’s costing me a lot to marry you, I’ll think of you as even more precious.
But let me hear the letter from your friend.
Dear Bassanio, my ships have all been wrecked.
My creditors are getting mean.
My money’s almost run out.
I couldn’t pay my debt to the Jew on the due date.
Since I’ll certainly die when he takes his collateral out of my flesh, all debts are cleared between you and me if I can just see you again before I die.
In any case, do what you want.
If your affection for me doesn’t convince you to come, don’t let my letter do so.” Oh, my darling, make your arrangements and go!
Since you’re letting me leave, I’ll hurry.
But I won’t sleep till I get back.
