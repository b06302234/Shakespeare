My lord!
Good or bad news, that thou com’st in so bluntly?
Bad news, my lord.
Morton is fled to Richmond, And Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen, Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.
Come, I have learned that fearful commenting Is leaden servitor to dull delay; Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary; Then fiery expedition be my wing, Jove’s Mercury, and herald for a king.
Go, muster men.
My counsel is my shield.
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
