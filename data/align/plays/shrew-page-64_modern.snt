That’s good, if he’ll really do it.
Have you told him all her faults, Hortensio?
I know she is a hateful, brawling scold.
If that’s all, gentlemen, I see no problem.
No?
Tell me, friend.
Where are you from?
Born in Verona.
I’m old Antonio’s son.
My father’s dead, and his fortune is mine now.
I hope to see good days—and many of them.
Sir, such a life with such a wife is unlikely!
But if you have the stomach for it, you’ll have all the help from me you need.
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat?
Do I mean to go on breathing?
He’ll woo her or I’ll hang her.
Why did I come here if not for that?
Do you think a little burst of noise can intimidate me—I, who have heard lions roar?
I, who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals?
I, who have heard the rumble of guns in battle—and thunder in the sky (heaven’s version of artillery).
