Please stand up!
I’m sure you aren’t Launcelot, my boy.
Come on, quit fooling around.
Give me your blessing.
I’m Launcelot, who was your boy, is your son, and will be your child.
I can’t believe you’re my son.
I don’t know what to say to that, but the fact is I’m Launcelot, the Jew’s servant, and Margery, your wife, is my mother.
Yes, you’re right, her name is Margery.
If you’re Launcelot, then you’re my own flesh and blood.
Then Dobbin’s tail must be growing backward.
I’m sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.
Lord, how you’ve changed!
How are you and your master getting along?
I’ve brought him a present.
How are you?
I’m all right.
But I’ve decided to run away, and I can’t wait to get going.
My master’s a total Jew.
You’re giving him a present?
Give him a noose to hang himself.
He’s starving me to death.
You can see my ribs so well you can count them.
I’m glad you’ve come, father.
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio.
He gives his servants beautiful new uniforms.
