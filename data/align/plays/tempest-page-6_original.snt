Down with the topmast!
Yare, lower, lower!
Bring her to try wi' th' main course.
A plague upon this howling!
They are louder than the weather or our office.
Yet again?
What do you here?
Shall we give o'er and drown?
Have you a mind to sink?
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!
Work you, then.
Hang, cur!
Hang, you whoreson insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
Iâ€™ll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
Lay her a-hold, a-hold!
Set her two courses off to sea again.
Lay her off!
All lost!
To prayers, to prayers, all lost!
