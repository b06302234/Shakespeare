Nurse, where’s my daughter?
Call her forth to me.
Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come.
What, lamb!
What, ladybird!
God forbid!
Where’s this girl?
What, Juliet!
How now, who calls?
Your mother.
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?
This is the matter.—Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret.—Nurse, come back again.
I have remembered me.
Thou’s hear our counsel.
Thou know’st my daughter’s of a pretty age.
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
She’s not fourteen.
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth—and yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four—she is not fourteen.
How long is it now to Lammastide?
A fortnight and odd days.
