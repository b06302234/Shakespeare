He who chooses me will get what many men want.” What many men want—that “many” could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy.
They don’t go beyond what their eyes see.
They don’t bother to find out what’s on the inside.
Just like those birds called martins who build their nests on the outside of walls, people pay too much attention to what’s on the outside.
So I won’t choose what many men desire, because I won’t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population.
So I guess it’s you, you silver treasure house.
Tell me once more what you say.
He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” That’s nicely put—because who’s going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves?
No one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve.
Oh, wouldn’t it be great if property, rank, official positions, and other honors were earned only by merit, not by corruption?
There wouldn’t be too many important men then.
How many people who are humble now would be great then?
How many people who give orders now would have to take orders?
How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants?
And how many common people would suddenly shine with nobility?
Well, let me get back to my choice.
He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” I’ll assume I deserve the very best.—Give me a key for this one.
I’ll unlock my fate here in a second.
You thought about it too long, considering what you found there.
