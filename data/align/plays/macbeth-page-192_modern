Seyton!—I’m sick at heart when I see—Seyton, come here!—This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne.
I have lived long enough.
The course of my life is beginning to wither and fall away, like a yellowing leaf in autumn.
The things that should go along with old age, like honor, love, obedience, and loyal friends, I cannot hope to have.
Instead, I have passionate but quietly whispered curses, people who honor me with their words but not in their hearts, and lingering life, which my heart would gladly end, though I can’t bring myself to do it.
Seyton!
What do you want?
Is there more news?
All the rumors have been confirmed.
I’ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones.
Give me my armor.
You don’t need it yet.
I’ll put it on anyway.
Send out more cavalry.
Scour the whole country and hang anyone spreading fear.
Give me my armor.
She is not sick, my lord, but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping.
