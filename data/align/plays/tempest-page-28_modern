You look sleepy.
It’s a nice hazy feeling, so give in to it.
I know you have no choice.
Come on, servant, come.
I’m ready now.
Come here, Ariel.
Humble greetings, great master!
Worthy sir, greetings!
Your wish is my command, whatever you want.
If you want me to fly, to swim, to jump into fire, to ride the clouds in the sky, Ariel will get right to the task.
Spirit, did you carry out the storm just as I ordered?
Down to the last detail.
I boarded the king’s ship, and in every corner of it, from the deck to the cabins, I made everyone astonished and terrified.
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once.
On the top sail and main mast I flamed in different spots, then I came together into a single flame.
I flashed about faster than lightning.
The fire and deafening cracks seemed to overwhelm even the god of the sea himself, making him tremble underwater.
Good spirit!
Who could ever be so steady and strong that a disturbance like that wouldn’t make him crazy?
