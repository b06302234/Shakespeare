I’m not kidding when I say this, I’m not joking around like usual.
You should be serious too when you listen to what I’m saying.
You can become a great man if you listen to me.
I’m hanging on every word you say.
You need to do more than hang around—you have to act.
I’ll show you how.
You need to.
I’m lazy by nature.
Oh, if you only knew how close to success you are, even while you make fun of what I’m telling you!
The more you joke about it, the more clearly I feel how serious it is!
Lazy people end up at the bottom, and you deserve to be at the top.
Please, tell me more.
There’s something in your expression that tells me you have something serious to say, and you’re having a lot of difficulty saying it.
This is what I’m saying.
