I swear—      By nothing, for this is no oath.
Thy George, profaned, hath lost his lordly honor; Thy garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue; Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.
If something thou wouldst swear to be believed, Swear then by something that thou hast not wronged.
Then, by myself—      Thyself is self-misused.
Now, by the world—      'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
My father’s death—      Thy life hath it dishonored.
Why then, by God.
God’s wrong is most of all.
If thou didst fear to break an oath by Him, The unity the king my husband made Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.
If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him, Th' imperial metal circling now thy head Had graced the tender temples of my child, And both the princes had been breathing here, Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust, Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.
What canst thou swear by now?
