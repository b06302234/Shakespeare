I’ll pheeze you, in faith.
A pair of stocks, you rogue!
Y'are a baggage, the Slys are no rogues.
Look in the chronicles—we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore  You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
No, not a denier.
Go by, Saint Jeronimy.
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.
I know my remedy.
I must go fetch the thirdborough.
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I’ll answer him by law.
I’ll not budge an inch, boy.
Let him come, and kindly.
