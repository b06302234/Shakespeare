At last, a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being.
That done, he lets me go, And, with his head over his shoulder turned, He seemed to find his way without his eyes, For out o' doors he went without their helps, And to the last bended their light on me.
Come, go with me.
I will go seek the king.
This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures.
I am sorry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
No, my good lord.
But as you did command I did repel his fetters and denied His access to me.
That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him.
I feared he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee.
But beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion.
Come, go we to the king.
This must be known, which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
Come.
