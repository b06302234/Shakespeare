This was the noblest Roman of them all.
All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar.
He only in a general honest thought And common good to all, made one of them.
His life was gentle, and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world, “This was a man.” According to his virtue let us use him, With all respect and rites of burial.
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.
So call the field to rest, and let’s away To part the glories of this happy day.
