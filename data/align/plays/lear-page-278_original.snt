Some officers take them away.
Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them.
We are not the first Who with best meaning have incurred the worst.
For thee, oppressèd King, I am cast down.
Myself could else outfrown false fortune’s frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
No, no, no, no!
Come, let’s away to prison.
We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.
When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness.
So we’ll live, And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues Talk of court news, and we’ll talk with them too— Who loses and who wins, who’s in, who’s out— And take upon ’s the mystery of things As if we were God’s spies.
And we’ll wear out In a walled prison packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by the moon.
Take them away.
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, The gods themselves throw incense.
Have I caught thee?
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven And fire us hence like foxes.
Wipe thine eyes.
