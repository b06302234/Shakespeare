Sir Christopher, relay this message to Richmond: My son George Stanley is penned up in the bloody boar’s sty.
If I revolt, off goes young George’s head.
My fear of that prevents me from helping Richmond at this time.
But, tell me, where is the noble Richmond now?
At Pembroke, or at Harfordwest in Wales.
Which noblemen have joined him?
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier; Sir Gilbert Talbot; Sir William Stanley; Oxford; the highly feared Pembroke; Sir James Blunt; Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew; and many other famous and powerful noblemen.
They plan to head straight to London, assuming they don’t encounter any resistance on the way.
