That’s right, uncle, talk to your heart, like the  Good morning to you both.
Hail to your majesty.
I’m glad to see your highness.
I believe you are, Regan.
You know why I think so?
Because if you weren’t glad, I’d divorce your dead mother, because I’d know she cheated on me.
Any true daughter of mine would definitely be glad to see me.
My dear Regan, your sister’s not worth anything.
Oh, Regan, she’s torn me apart with unkindness, like a vulture, right here.
