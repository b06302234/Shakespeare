Hardly, Kate.
By the same token you are worth no less for your simple clothes and lack of finery.

It shall be seven o'clock before I get on my horse.
Whatever I say, or think, or do, you’re continually contradicting it.
Sirs, never mind.
We won’t go today—or any day until it’s clear that it shall be whatever time I say it is.
