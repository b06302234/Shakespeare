Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
What, jealous Oberon?—Fairies, skip hence.
I have forsworn his bed and company.
Tarry, rash wanton.
Am not I thy lord?
Then I must be thy lady.
But I know When thou hast stolen away from Fairyland, And in the shape of Corin sat all day, Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida.
Why art thou here, Come from the farthest step of India?
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, Your buskined mistress and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded, and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity.
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna, whom he ravishèd?
And make him with fair Ægles break his faith, With Ariadne and Antiopa?
