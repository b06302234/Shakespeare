No, not until Thursday.
There’s plenty of time.
Go, Nurse, go with her.
We’ll have the wedding at the church tomorrow.
Our supplies will be short for the party.
It’s already almost night.
Don’t worry, I will set things in motion.
And everything will be alright, I promise you, wife.
You should go to Juliet and dress her up.
I’m not going to bed tonight.
Leave me alone.
I’ll pretend to be the housewife for once.
Hey!
What?
They’re all gone?
Well, I will walk by myself to Count Paris to get him ready for tomorrow.
My heart is wonderfully happy because this troubled girl has been taken back and now will be married.
