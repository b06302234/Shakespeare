And even then we’re still indebted to you.
We owe you love and service forever.
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough.
In saving you I consider myself well paid.
My thoughts were never on money.
I hope you’ll recognize me when we meet again.
I wish you well.
Now, I’ve got to go.
Sir, I really feel the need to give you something.
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude, not as a fee.
Please do two favors for me.
First, don’t refuse me, and second, excuse me for insisting.
Since you keep insisting, I’ll do as you say.
This ring, sir—oh no, it’s nothing.
I’d be ashamed to give you this.
I don’t want anything but that.
Now that I think about it, I really want it.
