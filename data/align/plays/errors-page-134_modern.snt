I was as harsh as I could be while still being a lady.
You scolded him in private?
And in public too.
Fine, but not enough.
It was all we talked about.
I kept him awake at night talking about it.
He couldn’t eat without me talking about it.
When we were alone, it was the only thing I talked about, and when we were with other people, I often found a way to mention it.
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was.
And that’s why he went crazy.
A jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog.
You disturbed his sleep with your complaining, which is why he’s disoriented.
You seasoned his food with screams.
Stress during mealtime ruins the digestion, and that gave him a raging fever.
Fever, as we know, is a kind of madness.
You spoiled his fun by fighting with him, and when people can’t enjoy themselves, they grow moody and dull with melancholy—they come very close to being grim and cheerlessly depressed.
Next thing you know, all kinds of terrible illnesses break out.
Ruining his meals, his enjoyment, and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad.
What I’m saying is, your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity.
