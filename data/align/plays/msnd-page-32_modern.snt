Hello, spirit!
Where are you going?
I go over hills and valleys, through bushes and thorns, over parks and fenced-in spaces, through water and fire.
I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth.
I work for Titania, the Fairy Queen, and organize fairy dances for her in the grass.
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards.
You’ll see that their petals have spots on them—those are rubies, fairy gifts.
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles.
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower.
Goodbye, you dumb old spirit.
I’ve got to go.
The queen and her elves will be here soon.
The king’s having a party here tonight.
Just make sure the queen doesn’t come anywhere near him, because King Oberon is extremely angry.
He’s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king.
She’s never kidnapped such a darling human child before, and Oberon’s jealous.
He wants the child for himself, to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests.
But the queen refuses to hand the boy over to Oberon.
Instead, she puts flowers in the boy’s hair and makes a fuss over him.
