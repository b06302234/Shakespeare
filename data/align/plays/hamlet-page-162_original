Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
We shall know by this fellow.
The players cannot keep counsel.
They’ll tell all.
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Ay, or any show that you will show him.
Be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.
You are naught, you are naught.
I’ll mark the play.
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?
Tis brief, my lord.
As woman’s love.
