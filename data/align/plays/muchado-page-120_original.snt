you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s name.
How if he will not stand?
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave.
If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects.
True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s subjects.—You shall also make no noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
We will rather sleep than talk.
We know what belongs to a watch.
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend.
Only have a care that your bills be not stolen.
Well, you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
How if they will not?
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober.
If they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.
Well, sir.
