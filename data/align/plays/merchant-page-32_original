I do never use it.
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban’s sheep— This Jacob from our holy Abram was, As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, The third possessor, ay, he was the third— And what of him?
Did he take interest?
No, not take interest—not as you would say Directly interest.
Mark what Jacob did: When Laban and himself were compromised That all the eanlings which were streaked and pied Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes, being rank, In the end of autumn turnèd to the rams.
And when the work of generation was Between these woolly breeders in the act, The skillful shepherd peeled me certain wands.
And in the doing of the deed of kind He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes, Who then conceiving did in eaning time Fall parti-colored lambs—and those were Jacob’s.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blessed.
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for— A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
I cannot tell: I make it breed as fast.
But note me, signor—
