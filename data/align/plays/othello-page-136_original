Emilia, come.—Be as your fancies teach you.
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
Excellent wretch!
Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee!
And when I love thee not Chaos is come again.
My noble lord— What dost thou say, Iago?
Did Michael Cassio, when you wooed my lady, Know of your love?
He did, from first to last.
Why dost thou ask?
But for a satisfaction of my thought, No further harm.
Why of thy thought, Iago?
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
Oh, yes, and went between us very oft.
Indeed?
Indeed?
Ay, indeed!
Discern’st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?
Honest, my lord?
