Cassio shall have my place.
And, sir, tonight I do entreat that we may sup together.
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.
Goats and monkeys!
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient?
Is this the nature Whom passion could not shake?
Whose solid virtue The shot of accident nor dart of chance Could neither graze nor pierce?
He is much changed.
Are his wits safe?
Is he not light of brain?
Heâ€™s that he is.
I may not breathe my censure What he might be.
If what he might he is not, I would to heaven he were!
What?
Strike his wife?
Faith, that was not so well.
Yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst!
Is it his use?
Or did the letters work upon his blood And new-create his fault?
