That’s what she was expecting, and you let her down.
You wasted a golden opportunity, and now my lady thinks badly of you.
You can only raise her opinion of you with some impressive act of courage or complicated intrigue.
I’ll have to do something courageous then, because I hate intrigue.
I’d rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots.
Well then, improve your situation with a show of courage.
Challenge the count’s young servant to a fight.
Hurt him in eleven different places.
My niece Olivia will notice, and let me tell you, no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage.
It’s really the only way, Sir Andrew.
Will either of you give him the message that I’m challenging him to a duel?
Go ahead and write it down.
Make your handwriting look like a soldier’s.
Be pointed and brief.
It doesn’t need to be witty as long as it’s eloquent and imaginative.
Taunt him as much as you want, since you’re only doing it in writing.
It’s fine if you refer to him as “thou” instead of  Where will I find you when I’ve finished it?
