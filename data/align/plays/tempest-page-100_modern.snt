You haven’t hurt me much yet, but you will soon, I can tell by your trembling.
Prospero sent you here.
I almost recognize that voice.
It’s—But he’s drowned, and these guys are devils.
Oh, God help me!
Four legs and two voices—a very special monster.
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend.
The other voice is harsh and abusive.
I can charge even more for this.
If it takes all the wine in my bottle, I’ll cure him.
Come on.
CALIBAN  Stephano!
Is your other mouth calling my name?
Mercy, mercy!
This isn’t a monster, it’s a devil.
I’ll leave him alone.
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil.
Stephano!
If you’re Stephano, touch me and speak to me.
I’m Trinculo—don’t be scared—your good friend Trinculo.
If you’re Trinculo, then come out.
I’ll pull on these smaller legs.
If any legs here are Trinculo’s, these are.
