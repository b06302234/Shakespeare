Yes, yes, that was Bassanio.
I think that was his name.
Yes, madam, that’s the one.
He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I’ve ever seen.
I remember him well, and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise.
Hello, do you have any news?
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye, madam.
And there’s a messenger representing a fifth one, the prince of Morocco, who says the prince will be here tonight.
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I’ll say goodbye to the first four, I’d be very happy he’s coming.
If he’s as good as a saint but is black like a devil, I’d rather he hear my confession than marry me.
Let’s go, Nerissa.—
