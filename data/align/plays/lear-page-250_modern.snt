The queen is here on special business, and her army has moved on.
Thank you, sir.
Gentle gods in heaven, please let me die.
Don’t tempt me to suicide again.
Pray well, father.
And who are you, good sir?
I’m a poor man who’s been humbled by many misfortunes.
I’ve had enough sorrow in my life to feel compassion for others.
Give me your hand.
I’ll lead you to some shelter.
Thank you very much.
May heaven bless you.
What good luck!
I’ll get the promised reward.
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich.
You old traitor, repent all your sins.
Prepare to die.
Death is exactly what I want.
I hope you’re strong enough to do it.
