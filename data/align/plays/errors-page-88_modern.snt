You gave me nothing, and you wrong me by saying you did.
You wrong me even more, sir, by denying it.
Consider how poorly this reflects on me.
Well, officer, I charge you to arrest him.
I will.
This harms my reputation.
Either pay this sum, Antipholus, or I’ll have this officer arrest you.
Pay for something I never got?
Go ahead, you fool.
Arrest me if you dare.
Officer, here’s your fee—arrest him.
I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly.
You’re under arrest, sir.
You hear the charges.
I’ll obey you until I can make bail.
But Angelo, you’ll pay for this, even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop.
Sir, the laws of Ephesus will be on my side, and you’ll be embarrassed.
I’m certain of it.
