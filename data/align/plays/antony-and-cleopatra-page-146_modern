Good-bye, my dearest sister, good-bye.
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease.
Farewell.
My noble brother!
Her eyes are like April: full of showers.
But they’ll flower into love.
What is it, Octavia?
I’ll tell you privately.
She won’t say what she’s feeling, and she can’t understand her feelings.
She’s balanced uneasily, like a feather on the swell of a great wave—she won’t move, even though her situation is about to change.
