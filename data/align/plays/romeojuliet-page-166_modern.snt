Romeo, come out.
Come out, you frightened man.
Trouble likes you, and you’re married to disaster.
Father, what’s the news?
What punishment did the Prince announce?
What suffering lies in store for me that I don’t know about yet?
You know too much about suffering.
I have news for you about the Prince’s punishment.
Is the Prince’s punishment any less awful than doomsday?
He made a gentler decision.
You won’t die, but you’ll be banished from the city.
Ha, banishment?
Be merciful and say “death.” Exile is much worse than death.
Don’t say “banishment.” From now on, you are banished from Verona.
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide.
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona, except purgatory, torture, and hell itself.
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world, and being banished from the world is death.
