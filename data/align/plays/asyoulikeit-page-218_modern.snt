And I for no woman.
Since you know all this is true, why do you blame me for loving you?
And why do you blame me for loving you?
And why do you blame me for loving you?
Who are you talking to?
I’m saying it to the girl who isn’t here and doesn’t hear me.
All right, stop this.
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon.
As long as I’m alive, I’ll be here.
Me too.
Me too.
