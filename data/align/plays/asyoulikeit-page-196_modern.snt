When young Orlando left you last, he promised to return within an hour.
He was pacing through the forest, thinking bittersweet thoughts of love, and listen what happened!
He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then: under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back.
A green and gold snake had wound itself around this man’s neck and was slowly making its way toward the man’s mouth.
However, when it saw Orlando, it unwound itself and slunk away into a bush.
But there happened to be a lioness crouching under that bush.
Her cubs had nursed from her until she was dry, so she was ravenously hungry, and she was lying with her head on the ground, watching the man as cats do and waiting to see if he would wake up—a lion won’t prey on anything that seems dead.
Seeing the lioness, Orlando approached the sleeping man.
He discovered that the man was his older brother.
Oh, I’ve heard him talk about that brother, and he described him as the most inhumane man alive.
And he was right.
I know exactly how inhumane he was.
But, back to Orlando, did he leave his brother there, to be food for the hungry mother-lioness?
