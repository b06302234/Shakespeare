I must indeed.
That’s why I came here.
Good and noble young man, don’t mess with someone who’s desperate.
Get away from here and leave me.
Think about the ones who have died.
Let them put fear in your heart.
Please, young man, don’t make me angry.
I don’t want to commit another crime.
Oh, go away!
I swear, I love you more than I love myself.
For I’ve come here with weapons to use against myself.
Don’t stay here, go away.
Live, and from now on, say a madman mercifully told you to run away.
