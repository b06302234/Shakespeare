I have to go to England, don’t you know that?
Ah, I’d forgotten all about that!
It’s been decided.
Yes, it’s a done deal, the documents are ready, and my two schoolmates, whom I trust about as much as rattlesnakes, are in charge.
They’re the ones who’ll lead me on my march to mischief.
Let it happen.
It’s fun to watch the engineer get blown up by his own explosives, and with any luck I’ll dig a few feet below their bombs and blow them to the moon.
Oh, it’s nice to kill two birds with one stone.
