Isn’t that him on the ground?
He doesn’t seem to be alive.

Isn’t that him?
No, it  Yes, he killed himself because he thought we’d lost the whole battle.

Pindarus!
Where are you, Pindarus?
Look for him, Titinius, while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news.
I say “force” because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this.
