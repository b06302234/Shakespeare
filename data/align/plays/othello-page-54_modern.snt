I’ve never been more useful to you than I will be now.
Here’s what you’ll do.
Sell all your assets and your land, and turn it into cash.
Desdemona can’t continue loving the Moor any more than he can continue loving her.
She fell in love with him very suddenly, and they’ll break up just as suddenly.
Moors are moody people.—So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash.
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter.
She’ll dump Othello for a younger man.
When she’s had enough of the Moor’s body, she’ll realize her mistake.
She’ll need to have a new lover.
She’ll have to have it.
So have your money ready.
If you want to go to hell, there are better ways to do it than killing yourself.
Raise all the money you can.
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl.
You’ll get to sleep with her—just put together some money.
And to hell with drowning yourself!
That’s completely beside the point.
If you’re ready to die, you can risk death by committing crimes in an attempt to get the woman you want.
Don’t just give up on her and drown yourself.
Can I count on you if I wait to see what happens?
You can trust me.
Go now and get cash.
I told you before, and I’ll tell you again and again: I hate the Moor.
I’m devoted to my cause of hating him, just as devoted as you are to yours.
So let’s join forces and get revenge.
If you seduce Desdemona and make a fool out of him, it’ll be fun for both of us.
Many things may happen.
Go get money.
We’ll speak again tomorrow.
Goodbye.
Where will we meet in the morning?
