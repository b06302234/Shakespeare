And pour our treasures into foreign laps, Or else break out in peevish jealousies, Throwing restraint upon us.
Or say they strike us, Or scant our former having in despite.
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge.
Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them.
They see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour, As husbands have.
What is it that they do When they change us for others?
Is it sport?
I think it is.
And doth affection breed it?
I think it doth.
Is â€™t frailty that thus errs?
It is so too.
And have not we affections, Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well, else let them know, The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
Good night, good night.
Heaven me such uses send, Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
