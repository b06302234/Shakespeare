story of how we fell in love, and what drugs, charms, spells, and powerful magic—because that’s what I’m being accused of—I used to win his daughter.
She’s a good girl, quiet and obedient.
She blushes at the slightest thing.
And you want me to believe that despite her young age and proper upbringing she fell in love with a man she’d be afraid to look at?
The very thought of it is ridiculous.
You’d have to be stupid to think that someone so perfect could make such an unnatural mistake as that.
The devil must be behind this.
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her.
Your saying this isn’t proof.
There has to be clear evidence that he’s done this, not just these accusations.
Tell us, Othello.
Did you trick or deceive this lady in some way?
Or did you agree to this as equals?
Please, send for Desdemona to come here from the Sagittarius Inn and ask her to speak about me in front
