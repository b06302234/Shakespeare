Indeed, he’s not right for this.
But should we only go after Caesar?
No one else?
Good point, Decius.
I don’t think it would be wise to let Mark Antony, whom Caesar is so fond of, outlive Caesar.
We’d find that he was a dangerous plotter.
And as you know, his connections, if he put them to good use, might be enough to hurt us all.
To prevent this, Mark Antony should die along with Caesar.
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar’s head and then hack at his arms and legs too, Caius Cassius—because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar’s arms.
It’ll look like we killed Caesar out of anger and Mark Antony out of envy.
Let’s be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.
We’re all against what Caesar stands for, and there’s no blood in that.
Oh, how I wish we could oppose Caesar’s spirit—his overblown ambition—and not hack up Caesar himself!
But, unfortunately, Caesar has to bleed if we’re going to stop him.
Noble friends, let’s kill him boldly but not with anger.
Let’s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods, not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs.
Let’s be angry only long enough to do the deed, and then let’s act like we’re disgusted by what we had to do.
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful.
If we appear calm to the people, they’ll call us surgeons rather than murderers.
As for Mark Antony—forget him.
He’ll be as useless as Caesar’s arm after Caesar’s head is cut off.
