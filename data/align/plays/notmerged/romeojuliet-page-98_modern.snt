When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer.
Good morning, father.
God bless you.
Who greets me so early in the morning?
Young man, something’s wrong if you’re getting out of bed this early.
Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world.
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep.
Therefore, the fact that you’re awake this early tells me you’ve been upset with some anxiety.
If that’s not the case, then this must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight.
Your last guess is right.
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep.
May God forgive you if you’ve sinned!—Were you with Rosaline?
With Rosaline, father?
No, I have forgotten that girl and all the sadness she brought me.
That’s good, my boy.
But where have you been?
I’ll tell you before you have to ask me again.
I have been feasting with my enemy.
Suddenly someone wounded me with love and was wounded with love by me.
You have the sacred power to cure both of us.
I carry no hatred, holy man, because my request will benefit my enemy.
