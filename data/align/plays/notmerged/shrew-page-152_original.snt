Why, a horse.
Tell thou the tale!
But hadst thou not crossed me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse.
Thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed that never prayed before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienced to thy grave.
By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home.
But what talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest.
Let their heads be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their garters of an indifferent knit.
Let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my masterâ€™s horse-tail till they kiss their hands.
Are they all ready?
They are.
Call them forth.
