When we’re properly dressed for the cold, let’s meet and discuss this bloody crime to see if we can figure anything out.
Right now we’re shaken up by fears and doubts.
I’m putting myself in God’s hands, and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder.
So will I.
So will we all.
Let’s get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall.
Agreed.
What are you going to do?
Let’s not stay here with them.
It’s easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none.
I’m going to England.
I’ll go to Ireland.
We’ll both be safer if we go separate ways.
Wherever we go, men will smile at us while hiding daggers.
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us.
We haven’t yet encountered that danger, and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely.
With that in mind, let’s get on our horses.
We’d better not worry about saying polite good-byes; we should just get away quickly.
There’s good reason to escape when there’s no mercy to be found anymore.
