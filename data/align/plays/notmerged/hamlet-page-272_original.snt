Alas, then she is drowned.
Drowned, drowned.
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears.
But yet It is our trick.
Nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will.
When these are gone, The woman will be out.—Adieu, my lord.
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze, But that this folly doubts it.
Let’s follow, Gertrude.
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Now fear I this will give it start again.
Therefore let’s follow.
