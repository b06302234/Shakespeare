This was the noblest Roman of them all.
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar.
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good.
His life was gentle, and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world, “This was a man.” Let’s treat him according to his virtue, with all the respect and rituals of burial.
His body will lie in my tent tonight, with the honorable observance that suits a soldier.
So order the armies to rest, and let’s go home to share the glories of this happy day.
