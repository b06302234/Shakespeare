Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
I fly, Biondello.
But they may chance to need thee at home.
Therefore leave us.
Nay, faith, I’ll see the church a' your back, and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can.
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
Sir, here’s the door.
This is Lucentio’s house.
My father’s bears more toward the marketplace.
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
You shall not choose but drink before you go.
I think I shall command your welcome here, And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
They’re busy within.
You were best knock louder.
