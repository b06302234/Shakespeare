Oh, the poor bird.
Now he’ll hide himself in the bushes.
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time.
The Prince’s fool”!
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful.
Yes, but I am insulting myself by thinking this way.
I don’t have that kind of reputation!
Beatrice’s mean, sarcastic nature makes her believe that the entire world shares her opinions; that’s why she describes me this way.
Well, I’ll get my revenge.
Now, sir, where is Claudio?
Did you see him?
Yes, my lord, I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news.
I found him here,  Beating?
Why, what did he do?
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird’s nest and happily shows it to his friend, who then steals it from him.
What, is trusting a friend such a crime?
The criminal is the one who stole the nest.
