On, on, on, on, on!
To the breach, to the breach!
Pray thee, corporal, stay.
The knocks are too hot, and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives.
The humor of it is too hot; that is the very plainsong of it.
The plainsong‚Äù is most just, for humors do abound.
Would I were in an alehouse in London!
I would give all my fame for a pot of ale, and safety.
And I.
Up to the breach, you dogs!
Avaunt, you cullions!
