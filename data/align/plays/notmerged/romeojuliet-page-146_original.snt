Help me into some house, Benvolio, Or I shall faint.
A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me.
I have it, And soundly too.
Your houses!
This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally, My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt In my behalf.
My reputation stained With Tybalt’s slander.—Tybalt, that an hour Hath been my kinsman!
O sweet Juliet, Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper softened valor’s steel!
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds, Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
This day’s black fate on more days doth depend.
This but begins the woe others must end.
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Alive in triumph—and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity, And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.
Now, Tybalt, take the “villain” back again That late thou gavest me, for Mercutio’s soul Is but a little way above our heads, Staying for thine to keep him company.
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
