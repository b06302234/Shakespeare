Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
Now must I to the monument alone.
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents.
But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man’s tomb!
