Can I go away while my heart stays here?
I have to go back to where my heart is.
He’s a smart boy.
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed.
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall.
Call to him, Mercutio.
I’ll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit.
Romeo!
Madman!
Passion!
Lover!
Show yourself in the form of a sigh.
Speak one rhyme, and I’ll be satisfied.
Just cry out, “Ah me!” Just say “love” and “dove.” Say just one lovely word to my good friend
