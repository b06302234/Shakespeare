Sweet flowers for a sweet girl.
Goodbye!
Oh, damn three times, damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind.
Hold off burying her until I’ve caught her in my arms once more.
Now pile the dirt onto the living and the dead alike, till you’ve made a mountain higher than   To hell with your soul!
That’s no way to pray.
Pull them apart.
