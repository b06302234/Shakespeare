Why, this was modeled on a porridge bowl!
It’s a velvet dish!
No, definitely not!
It’s cheap and nasty!
It’s like a cockleshell or a walnut shell, a joke, a prank, a doll’s cap.
Take it away.
Bring me a bigger one.
I won’t have one any bigger.
This is the fashion.
Gentlewomen are wearing caps like this right now.
When you are gentle, you shall have one, too, and not till then.
Sir, I think I have the right to speak, and speak I certainly will.
I am not a child or an infant.
Better men than you have heard me speak my mind, and if you can’t take it, then you’d better plug your ears.
I’ll express my anger or die concealing it.
And rather than have that happen, I’ll give myself permission to speak as freely as I like, whatever I may have to say.
You know, you’re right.
It’s a measly little cap, a dessert crust, a plaything, a silk pie.
I love you all the more for not liking it.
I don’t care if you love me or not, I like the cap and I’ll have it or I won’t have any.
Now, your gown?
Yes, yes.
Come, tailor, show it to us.
Merciful God!
What sort of costume do we have here?
What do you call this?
A sleeve?
It’s like a cannon.
