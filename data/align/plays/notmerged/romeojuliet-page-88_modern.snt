Only to be generous and give it to you once more.
But I’m wishing for something I already have.
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea, and my love is as deep.
The more love I give you, the more I have.
Both loves are infinite.
I hear a noise inside.
Dear love, goodbye—Just a minute, good Nurse.
Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay here for a moment.
I’ll come back.
Oh, blessed, blessed night!
Because it’s dark out, I’m afraid all this is just a dream, too sweet to be real.
Three words, dear Romeo, and then it’s good night for real.
If your intentions as a lover are truly honorable and you want to marry me, send me word tomorrow.
I’ll send a messenger to you, and you can pass on a message telling me where and when we’ll be married.
I’ll lay all my fortunes at your feet and follow you, my lord, all over the world.
