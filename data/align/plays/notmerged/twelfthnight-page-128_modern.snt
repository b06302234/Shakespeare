Cesario is my name—your servant’s name—fair princess.
My servant!
The world’s gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments.
You’re not my servant, young man.
You’re Count Orsino’s servant.
But he’s your servant, so everything that’s his must be yours too.
Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.
As for him, I never think about him.
As for his thoughts, I wish he’d think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time.
Madam, I’ve come here to try to make you like him.
Oh, please, I’m begging you, don’t mention him again.
But if you want to tell me that someone else loves me, I’d enjoy hearing that more than I’d enjoy listening to angels sing.
My dear lady— Please let me say something, I’m begging you.
After you cast your magic spell on me last time, I sent you a ring.
I fear it was a mistake, since I tricked my servant, myself, and you too.
You probably think poorly of me after I forced that ring on you with such outrageous trickery.
What else could you possibly think of me?
