great princes of France and Burgundy, vying for the hand of my youngest Cordelia, have been at my court a long time and will soon have their answers.—My daughters, since I’m about to give up my throne and the worries that go along with it, tell me which one of you loves me most, so that I can give my largest gift to the one who deserves it most.—Goneril, my oldest daughter, you speak first.
Sir, I love you more than words can say.
I love you more than eyesight, space, and freedom, beyond wealth or anything of value.
I love you as much as life itself, and as much as status, health, beauty, or honor.
I love you as much as any child has ever loved her father, with a love too deep to be spoken of.
I love you more than any answer to the question “How much?”   I give you all this land, from this line to that one—dense forests, fertile fields, rivers rich with fish, wide meadows.
This land will belong to your and Albany’s children forever.—And now what does my second daughter Regan, the wife of Cornwall, have to say?
