So is Lysander.
You’re right, Lysander’s admirable too.
But since your father doesn’t want him to marry you, you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man.
I wish my father could see them with my eyes.
No, you must see them as your father sees them.
Your grace, please forgive me.
I don’t know what makes me think I can say this, and I don’t know if speaking my mind to such a powerful and noble person as yourself will damage my reputation for modesty.
But please, tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius.
You’ll either be executed or you’ll never see another man again.
So think carefully about what you want, beautiful Hermia.
Consider how young you are, and question your feelings.
Then decide whether you could stand to be a nun, wearing a priestess’s habit and caged up in a cloister forever, living your entire life without a husband or children, weakly chanting hymns to the cold and virginal goddess of the moon.
People who can restrain their passions and stay virgins forever are holy.
But although a virgin priestess might be rewarded in heaven, a married woman is happier on Earth.
A married woman is like a rose who is picked and made into a beautiful perfume, while a priestess just withers away on the stem.
