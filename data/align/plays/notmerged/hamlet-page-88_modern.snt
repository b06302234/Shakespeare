Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command, instead of asking us so politely.
But we’ll obey.
Our services are entirely at your command.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz.
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son, who’s changed too much.
Servants, take these gentlemen to see Hamlet.
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good!
Amen to that!
The ambassadors are back from Norway, sir.
Once again you bring good news.
Do I, sir?
I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty both to my God and my good king.
