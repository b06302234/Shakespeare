Thou, nature, art my goddess.
To thy law My services are bound.
Wherefore should I Stand in the plague of custom and permit The curiosity of nations to deprive me For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines Lag of a brother?
Why “bastard”?
Wherefore “base”?
When my dimensions are as well compact, My mind as generous, and my shape as true As honest madam’s issue?
Why brand they us With “base,” with “baseness,” “bastardy,” “base,” “base”— Who in the lusty stealth of nature take More composition and fierce quality Than doth within a dull, stale, tirèd bed Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops Got ’tween a sleep and wake?
Well then, Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.
Our father’s love is to the bastard Edmund As to the legitimate.—Fine word, “legitimate”!— Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed And my invention thrive, Edmund the base Shall top th' legitimate.
I grow, I prosper.
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
Kent banished thus?
And France in choler parted?
And the king gone tonight, prescribed his power Confined to exhibition?
All this done Upon the gad?—Edmund, how now?
What news?
