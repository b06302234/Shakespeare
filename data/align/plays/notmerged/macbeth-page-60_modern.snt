Where is that knocking coming from?
What’s happening to me, that I’m frightened of every noise?
My hands are as red as yours, but I would be ashamed if my heart were as pale and weak.
I hear someone knocking at the south entry.
Let’s go back to our bedroom.
A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt.
It’s so simple!
You’ve lost your resolve.
Listen!
There’s more knocking.
Put on your nightgown, in case someone comes and sees that we’re awake.
Snap out of your daze.
Rather than have to think about my crime, I’d prefer to be completely unconscious.
Wake Duncan with your knocking.
I wish you could!
