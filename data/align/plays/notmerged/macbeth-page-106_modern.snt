You know your own ranks, so you know where to sit.
Sit down.
From the highest to the lowest of you, I bid you a hearty welcome.
Thanks to your majesty.
I will walk around and mingle with all of you, playing the humble host.
My wife will stay in her royal chair, but at the appropriate time I will have her welcome you all.
Say welcome to all of our friends for me, sir, for in my heart they are all welcome.
And they respond to you with their hearts as well.
The table is full on both sides.
I will sit here in the middle.
Be free and happy.
Soon we will toast around the table.
Then it must be Banquo’s.
I’d rather see his blood splattered on your face than flowing through his veins.
Did you finish him off?
