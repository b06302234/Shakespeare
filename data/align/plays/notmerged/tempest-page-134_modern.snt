I swear, I can’t go any further, sir.
My old bones are tired.
We’re wandering in a maze.
If you don’t mind, I need to rest a bit.
I can’t blame you, old lord.
I’m so tired myself that it’s bringing me down.
Sit down and rest.
I’m losing hope.
The one we’re looking for is dead.
We’re searching on land, but he’s lost in the sea.
We have to give up and let him go.
