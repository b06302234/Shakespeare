What, is Antonio here?
Ready, so please your grace.
I am sorry for thee.
Thou art come to answer A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity, void and empty From any dram of mercy.
I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course.
But since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envyâ€™s reach, I do oppose My patience to his fury, and am armed To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his.
Go, one, and call the Jew into the court.
He is ready at the door.
He comes, my lord.
