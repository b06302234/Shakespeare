Tut, I have the best armor of the world.
Would it were day!
You have an excellent armor, but let my horse have his due.
It is the best horse of Europe.
Will it never be morning?
My lord of Orléans, and my Lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armor?
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
What a long night is this!
I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
Çà ha!
He bounds from the earth, as if his entrails were hairs, le cheval volant, the Pegasus, qui a les narines de feu.
When I bestride him, I soar; I am a hawk; he trots the air.
The earth sings when he touches it.
The basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.
He’s of the color of the nutmeg.
And of the heat of the ginger.
It is a beast for Perseus.
He is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him.
He is indeed a horse, and all other jades you may call beasts.
