Well, thank God I’m cured!
Amen.
I thank you all.
You won’t regret this.
How is my noble lord?
Not bad, actually.
This is all quite pleasant.
Where is my wife?
Here, noble lord.
What is your wish with regard to her?
You call yourself my wife, yet you don’t call me “husband”?
It’s my men who should call me “lord.” I’m your man, your fellow.
My husband  Yes, I see.— “Madam.” “ Just “madam.” That’s how noblemen address their wives.
