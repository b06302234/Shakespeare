I pray you, let it stand.
The poorest service is repaid with thanks, And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
I thank you, sir.
Signior Petruchio, fie, you are to blame.

And now, my honey love, Will we return unto thy father’s house And revel it as bravely as the best, With silken coats and caps and golden rings, With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things, With scarves and fans and double change of brav'ry, With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry.

The tailor stays thy leisure To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments.
Lay forth the gown.
What news with you, sir?
Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak.
