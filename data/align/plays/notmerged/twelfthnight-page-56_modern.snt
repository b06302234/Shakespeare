I’m not a paid messenger, my lady.
Keep your money.
It’s my master who’s not getting the reward he deserves, not me.
I hope you fall in love with a man whose heart is hard as a rock and who treats your love like a big joke, just like you’ve done.
Goodbye, you beautiful, cruel woman.
Who are your parents?” “I was born to a higher position than I’ve got now.
But I’m still fairly high-ranking.
I’m a gentleman.” Yes, I’m sure you are.
Your way of talking, your face, your body, your behavior, and your sensitive soul all prove you’re a gentleman.
Ah, no.
Calm down, calm down.
If only his lord were more like him.
How strange I’m feeling!
Can someone fall in love this quickly?
I can feel this young man’s perfection creeping in through my eyes like some kind of disease, slowly and invisibly.
Oh, well.—Malvolio!
Come here!
At your service, madam.
Run after that obnoxious messenger, the duke’s servant.
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not.
Tell him I want nothing to do with it.
