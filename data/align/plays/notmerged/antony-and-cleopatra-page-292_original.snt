How!
Not dead?
Not dead?
The guard, ho!
Oh, dispatch me!
What’s the noise?
I have done my work ill, friends.
Oh, make an end Of what I have begun!
The star is fall’n.
And time is at his period.
Alas, and woe!
Let him that loves me strike me dead.
Not I.
Nor I.
Nor anyone.
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings, Shall enter me with him.
Where’s Antony?
There, Diomed, there.
Lives he?
Wilt thou not answer, man?
