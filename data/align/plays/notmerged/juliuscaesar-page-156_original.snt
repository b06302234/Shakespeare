So you thought him.
And took his voice who should be pricked to die In our black sentence and proscription.
Octavius, I have seen more days than you.
And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads, He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, To groan and sweat under the business, Either led or driven, as we point the way.
And having brought our treasure where we will, Then take we down his load and turn him off, Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears And graze in commons.
You may do your will, But heâ€™s a tried and valiant soldier.
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that I do appoint him store of provender.
It is a creature that I teach to fight, To wind, to stop, to run directly on, His corporal motion governed by my spirit, And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so.
He must be taught and trained and bid go forth, A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds On objects, arts, and imitations, Which, out of use and staled by other men, Begin his fashion.
Do not talk of him But as a property.
And now, Octavius, Listen great things.
Brutus and Cassius Are levying powers.
We must straight make head.
Therefore let our alliance be combined, Our best friends made, our means stretched.
