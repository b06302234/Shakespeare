I’ll be straight with you.
Do not doubt it.
But why, why, why?
You opposed my taking part in the war.
You said it wasn’t proper.
Well, is it?
Is it?
Isn’t this war against me?
Why shouldn’t I be there in person?
Well, I could answer that if we went to war on male and female horses alike—the male horses would be totally distracted and useless.
The mares would be ridden by their riders and the male horses.
What do you mean?
Antony will necessarily be distracted by your presence.
You will affect his heart and his head.
You’ll take up time he can’t afford to lose.
He’s already criticized for frivolous behavior.
In Rome they say that your eunuch Photinus and your maids run the war.
Let Rome fall!
May the tongues of our critics rot!
I have responsibilities in this war, and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man.
Don’t argue against it.
I won’t stay behind.
