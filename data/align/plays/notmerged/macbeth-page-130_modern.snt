The tawny cat has meowed three times.
Three times.
And the hedgehog has whined once.
My spirit friend, Harpier, is yelling, “It’s time, it’s time!” Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
