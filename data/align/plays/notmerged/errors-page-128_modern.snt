I’m sorry that I delayed you, sir.
But even though he denies it, I swear he got the necklace from me.
What’s this man’s reputation like here in the city?
People think very highly of him.
The merchants give him unlimited credit.
He’s well beloved, second to none in the city.
I’d trust him with everything I own.
Speak more quietly: I think he’s coming this way.
You’re right.
And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn’t have!
Good sir, stay close to me.
I’ll speak to him.
Signior Antipholus, I can’t believe you’d put me to this kind of shame and trouble—not to mention the scandal you’ve brought on yourself.
You swore I never gave you the necklace, but now you’re wearing it openly.
Not only has your lie cost you money, shame, and imprisonment, but you’ve also mistreated this honest friend of mine.
If it hadn’t been for this dispute, he would have already hoisted sail and left for sea.
You got that necklace from me: can you deny that?
