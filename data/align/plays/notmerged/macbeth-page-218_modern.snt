Hail, King of Scotland!
It won’t be long before I reward each of you as he deserves.
My thanes and kinsmen, I name you all earls, the first earls that Scotland has ever had.
We have a lot to do at the dawn of this new era.
We must call home all of our exiled friends who fled from the grip of Macbeth’s tyranny, and we must bring to justice all the evil ministers of this dead butcher and his demon-like queen, who, rumor has it, committed suicide.
This, and whatever else we are called to do by God, we will do at the right time and in the right place.
So I thank you all, and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone.
