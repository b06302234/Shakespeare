Oh, no—what’s that noise?
Listen!
Where are my bodyguards?
Let them guard the door.
What is it?
You must save yourself, my lord.
The young Laertes, like the ocean when it floods the shore and devours the lowlands, is leading a rebellion against your government.
The crowd calls him “lord” and shouts, “We want Laertes to be king!” It’s as if they were starting the world from scratch right now, throwing out the traditions and ancient customs that are the support of every word we utter.
They throw their caps in the air and yell, “Laertes will be king!
Laertes king!” They sound so cheerful as they hunt down the wrong prey!
Oh, you’re on the wrong track, you disloyal Danish dogs!
The doors have been smashed open.
