You are too senseless obstinate, my lord, Too ceremonious and traditional.
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
The benefit thereof is always granted To those whose dealings have deserved the place And those who have the wit to claim the place.
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.
Then taking him from thence that is not there, You break no privilege nor charter there.
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men, But sanctuary children, ne'er till now.
My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.— Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
I go, my lord.
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come, Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
If I may counsel you, some day or two Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower; Then where you please and shall be thought most fit For your best health and recreation.
I do not like the Tower, of any place.— Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
