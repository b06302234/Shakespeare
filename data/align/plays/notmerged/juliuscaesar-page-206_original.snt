A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor, Joined with a masker and a reveler!
Old Cassius still.
Come, Antony, away.â€” Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
If you dare fight today, come to the field.
If not, when you have stomachs.
Why, now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!
The storm is up and all is on the hazard.
Ho, Lucillius, hark, a word with you.
My lord?
Messala!
What says my general?
Messala, This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born.
Give me thy hand, Messala.
Be thou my witness that against my will, As Pompey was, am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties.
