By and by, I come.— To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
Tomorrow will I send.
So thrive my soul— A thousand times good night!
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Hist!
Romeo, hist!—Oh, for a falconer’s voice, To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, With repetition of “My Romeo!” It is my soul that calls upon my name.
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!
