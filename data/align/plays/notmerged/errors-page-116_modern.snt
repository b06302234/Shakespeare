Oh, husband, God himself knows you ate at home.
I wish you had stayed there, avoiding these scandals and this public embarrassment!
Ate at home?
You there, rogue, what do you have to say about that?
I swear, sir, you did not eat at home.
My doors were locked and I was shut out, right?
By God, your doors were locked and you were shut out.
And she screamed at me, right?
No lieâ€”she screamed at you.
And her cook yelled, mocked, and teased me, right?
She sure did.
The kitchen girl mocked you.
And I departed in a rage, right?
You truly did.
My body can prove it because it felt the power of your anger.
Good idea.
His servant here has figured out that agreeing is a good way to cope with his anger.
