No, just listen to me.
If you forgive my mistake, I swear I’ll never break an oath with you again.
I lent my body once to make him rich.
If it hadn’t been for the gentleman who now owns your husband’s ring, my body would’ve been lost.
I’d be the guarantee again, promising my soul this time as penalty, if your husband ever breaks a vow again knowingly.
My God, it’s the same one I gave the judge!
I got it from him.
I’m sorry, Bassanio, but the legal expert slept with me in exchange for this ring.      This is like fixing roads in the summer when they don’t need to be fixed!
What, did you cheat on us before we deserved it?
