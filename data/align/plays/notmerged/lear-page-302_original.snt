Run, run, O, run!
To who, my lord?—Who hath the office?
Send Thy token of reprieve.
Well thought on.
Take my sword.
The captain— Give it the captain.
Haste thee for thy life.
He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison and To lay the blame upon her own despair, That she fordid herself.
The gods defend her!—hear him hence awhile.
Howl, howl, howl, howl!
Oh, you are men of stones.
Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so That heaven’s vault should crack.
She’s gone forever.
I know when one is dead and when one lives.
She’s dead as earth.
Lend me a looking-glass.
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone, Why then, she lives.
Is this the promised end?
Or image of that horror?
