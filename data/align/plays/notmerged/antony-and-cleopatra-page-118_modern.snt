Let me shake your hand.
I’ve never been your enemy.
I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill.
Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave.
Enjoy your frankness; it suits you.
I invite you all aboard my ship.
After you, my lords?
Show us the way, sir.
Come with me.
I think it was at sea.
That it was, sir.
You’ve done well at sea.
And you’ve done well on land.
I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished on land cannot be denied.
Neither can my accomplishments at sea.
