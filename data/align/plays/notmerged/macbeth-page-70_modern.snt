Go into the bedroom and see for yourself.
What’s in there will make you freeze with horror.
Don’t ask me to talk about it.
Go look and then do the talking yourselves.
Wake up, wake up!
Ring the alarm bell.
Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain, Malcolm!
Wake up!
Shake off sleep, which looks like death, and look at death itself!
Get up, get up, and look at this image of doomsday!
Malcolm!
Banquo!
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves, and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror.
Ring the bell.
What’s going on?
Why is that terrifying trumpet calling together everyone who’s sleeping in the house?
Speak up and tell me!
Oh gentle lady, my news isn’t fit for your ears.
If I repeated it to you, it would kill you as soon as you heard it.
Oh Banquo, Banquo, the king has been murdered!
How horrible!
What, in our own house?
