Oh, Charmian, I will never leave this tomb!
Be calm, dear lady.
No, I won’t.
Strange and terrible events are all welcome, but I despise comforts.
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source.
What’s the news!
Is he dead?
He is close to death, but not dead yet.
Look out the other window; his guard has brought him here.
Oh, sun, burn up the orbit in which you move, so that the world may be dark forever!
Oh, Antony, Antony, Antony!
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Help, friends below; lift him up here.
Be calm!
It was not Caesar’s bravery that conquered Antony but Antony’s that has triumphed over himself.
That’s the way it should be—only Antony should conquer Antony.
But how terrible that it has happened!
