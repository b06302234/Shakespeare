No, sir, not I. I came from Syracuse.
Stay, stand apart.
I know not which is which.
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
And I with him.
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior Duke Menaphon, your most renown√®d uncle.
Which of you two did dine with me today?
I, gentle mistress.
And are not you my husband?
No, I say nay to that.
And so do I, yet did she call me so, And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here, Did call me brother.
I hope I shall have leisure to make good, If this be not a dream I see and hear.
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
I think it be, sir.
I deny it not.
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
I think I did, sir.
I deny it not.
