Lucius, awake.
My lord?
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
Yes, that thou didst.
Didst thou see any thing?
Nothing, my lord.

My lord?
My lord?
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
Did we, my lord?
Ay.
Saw you anything?
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
Nor I, my lord.
