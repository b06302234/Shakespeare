As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair, And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy!
O love, be moderate.
Allay thy ecstasy.
In measure rein thy joy.
Scant this excess.
I feel too much thy blessing.
Make it less, For fear I surfeit.
What find I here?
Fair Portia’s counterfeit!
What demigod Hath come so near creation?
Move these eyes?
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine, Seem they in motion?
Here are severed lips, Parted with sugar breath.
So sweet a bar Should sunder such sweet friends.
Here in her hairs, The painter plays the spider and hath woven A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs.
But her eyes— How could he see to do them?
Having made one, Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnished.
Yet look how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it, so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance.
Here’s the scroll, The continent and summary of my fortune.
You that choose not by the view, Chance as fair and choose as true.
Since this fortune falls to you, Be content and seek no new.
If you be well pleased with this And hold your fortune for your bliss, Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss.”
