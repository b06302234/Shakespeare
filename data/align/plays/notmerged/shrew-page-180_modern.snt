Yes, but the mustard is probably too hot.
Well then, the beef without the mustard.

How is my Kate?
Feeling blue, darling?
Mistress, how are you?
Believe me, I’ve been better.
Cheer up.
Give us a smile.
Look, love, see how devoted I am?
I’ve prepared a meal for you myself, and here it is.
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness deserves thanks.
What, not a word?
I guess you don’t want it.
Ah well, all my trouble was for nothing.
Here, take away the dish.
