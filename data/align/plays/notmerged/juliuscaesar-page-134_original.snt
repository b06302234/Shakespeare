Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept.
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse.
Was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And, sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause.
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
O judgment!
Thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason.
Bear with me.
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me.
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong.
Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
Marked ye his words?
He would not take the crown.
Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
Poor soul!
His eyes are red as fire with weeping.
There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
