Hence, away!
Now all is well.
One aloof stand sentinel.
What thou seest when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true love take.
Love and languish for his sake.
Be it ounce or cat or bear, Pard or boar with bristled hair, In thy eye that shall appear, When thou wakest, it is thy dear.
Wake when some vile thing is near.
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood.
And to speak troth, I have forgot our way.
