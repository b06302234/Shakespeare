Wretched boy, you hung out with him here, and you’re going to go to heaven with him.
This fight will decide who dies.
Romeo, get out of here.
The citizens are around, and Tybalt is dead.
Don’t stand there shocked.
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught.
So get out of here!
Oh, I have awful luck.
Why are you waiting?
The man who killed Mercutio, which way did he go?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?
Tybalt is lying over there.
