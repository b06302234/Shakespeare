O most unhappy strumpet!
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
Out on thee, villain!
Wherefore dost thou mad me?
Will you be bound for nothing?
Be mad, good master.
Cry “The devil!” God help poor souls!
How idly do they talk!
Go bear him hence Sister, go you with me.
Say now whose suit is he arrested at.
One Angelo, a goldsmith.
Do you know him?
I know the man.
What is the sum he owes?
Two hundred ducats.
Say, how grows it due?
Due for a chain your husband had of him.
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not.
