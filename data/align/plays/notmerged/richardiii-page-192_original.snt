What, think you we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, against the form of law, Proceed thus rashly in the villain’s death, But that the extreme peril of the case, The peace of England and our persons' safety Enforced us to this execution?
Now fair befall you!
He deserved his death, And your good Graces both have well proceeded To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
Yet had we not determined he should die Until your Lordship came to see his end (Which now the loving haste of these our friends, Something against our meaning, have prevented), Because, my lord, I would have had you heard The traitor speak, and timorously confess The manner and the purpose of his treasons, That you might well have signified the same Unto the citizens, who haply may Misconstrue us in him, and wail his death.
But, my good lord, your Graces' words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak; And do not doubt, right noble princes both, But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case.
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T' avoid the censures of the carping world.
