Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
For certain, sir, he is not.
I have a file Of all the gentry.
There is Siward’s son, And many unrough youths that even now Protest their first of manhood.
What does the tyrant?
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Some say he’s mad, others that lesser hate him Do call it valiant fury.
But, for certain, He cannot buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule.
Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands.
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach.
Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love.
Now does he feel his title Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe Upon a dwarfish thief.
