Here’s more news.
We’ve followed your commands, lord Caesar.
You shall have hourly updates regarding the situation at sea.
Pompey has a strong navy.
All the people who only stayed with you out of fear are gathering at the port to join him, in the opinion he’s been treated unfairly.
I should have known it.
It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized.
People will transfer their support to a strong figure until he becomes their actual leader.
Then they will value their former leader, even though the loss of their support has made him powerless.
The common crowd changes like the tide, to and fro, serving whoever is on the rise.
Their power is worn away by their fickleness.
Caesar, I have news about Menecrates and Menas, notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships.
They’ve made many raids upon Italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them.
The young, energetic men are joining Pompey.
These pirates can capture a ship as soon as it leaves the harbor, since the simple mention of the name “Pompey” carries as much power as a fleet of troops in battle.
