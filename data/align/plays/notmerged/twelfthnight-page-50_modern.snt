If I seemed rude, it’s because of how badly I was treated when I got here.
Who I am and what I want are a secret.
You’re the only one I can share the secret with.
It’s sacred, just for you.
It’s not for anyone else to hear.
Everyone, please leave us alone for a moment.
I’ve got a “sacred” secret to hear.
Now, sir, what’s this holy secret you wanted to tell me?
Most sweet lady— Oh, “sweet”!
It sounds like a nice and gentle kind of faith.
Where’s the passage of holy scripture that you’re basing your sermon on?
In Orsino’s heart.
In his heart?
In what chapter and verse of his heart?
The table of contents says it’s in the first chapter of his heart.
Oh, I’ve read that.
That’s not holy, it’s heresy.
Do you have anything else to say?
Madam, please let me see your face.
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face?
I don’t think so.
You’re overstepping your bounds now.
But I’ll open the curtain and let you see the picture.
Look, sir, this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment.
It’s pretty well done, isn’t it?
