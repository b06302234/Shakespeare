Here comes your father.
Never make denial.
I must and will have Katherine to my wife.
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
How but well, sir?
How but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.
Why, how now, daughter Katherine?
In your dumps?
Call you me daughter?
Now, I promise you You have showed a tender fatherly regard To wish me wed to one half lunatic, A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack, That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
Father, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world That talked of her have talked amiss of her.
If she be curst, it is for policy, For she’s not froward, but modest as the dove.
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn.
For patience she will prove a second Grissel, And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together, That upon Sunday is the wedding day.
I’ll see thee hanged on Sunday first.
Hark, Petruchio: she says she’ll see thee hanged first.
