Caesar, beware of Brutus.
Watch Cassius.
Don’t go near Casca.
Keep an eye on Cinna.
Don’t trust Trebonius.
Pay attention to Metellus Cimber.
Decius Brutus doesn’t love you.
You’ve wronged Caius Ligarius.
These men all have one intention, and it’s directed against Caesar.
If you aren’t immortal, watch those around you.
A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy.
I pray that the mighty gods defend you!
Your friend,      Artemidorus.” I’ll stand here until Caesar passes by, and I’ll give him this as though it’s a petition.
My heart regrets that good men aren’t safe from the bite of jealous rivals.
If you read this, Caesar, you might live.
If not, the Fates are on the side of the traitors.
