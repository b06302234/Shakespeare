The service and the loyalty I owe In doing it pays itself.
Your highness' part Is to receive our duties, and our duties Are to your throne and state children and servants, Which do but what they should, by doing everything Safe toward your love and honor.
Welcome hither.
I have begun to plant thee, and will labor To make thee full of growing.
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known No less to have done so, let me infold thee And hold thee to my heart.
There, if I grow, The harvest is your own.
My plenteous joys, Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow.
Sons, kinsmen, thanes, And you whose places are the nearest, know We will establish our estate upon Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter The prince of Cumberland; which honor must Not unaccompanied invest him only, But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine On all deservers.
And bind us further to you.
The rest is labor which is not used for you: Iâ€™ll be myself the harbinger and make joyful The hearing of my wife with your approach.
So humbly take my leave.
My worthy Cawdor!
