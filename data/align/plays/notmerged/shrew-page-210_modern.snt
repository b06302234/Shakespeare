Why, dear me, Kate!
I hope you haven’t lost your mind.
This is not a maiden, as you say, but an old man—wrinkled, faded, and withered.
Sir, pardon my imperfect eyes, which have been so blinded by the sun that everything I look at appears  Do, good old grandfather, and while you’re at it, tell us which way you’re traveling.
If we’re all headed in the same direction, we’d love your company.
Well, sir, and you, witty lady, who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk, my name is Vincentio, my hometown Pisa, and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I haven’t seen in a long while.
What is his name?
Lucentio, sir.
A fortunate coincidence—more fortunate for your son.
I can now call you “father” in a legal sense, not just out of respect for your age.
The sister of my wife, this lady here, is married to your son.
And there’s no need for wonder or worry.
His bride is well thought of, with a rich dowry and noble birth—a fit wife for any nobleman.
