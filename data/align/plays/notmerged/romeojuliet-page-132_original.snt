So smile the heavens upon this holy act That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.
Amen, amen.
But come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight.
Do thou but close our hands with holy words, Then love-devouring death do what he dare; It is enough I may but call her mine.
These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume.
The sweetest honey Is loathsome in his own deliciousness And in the taste confounds the appetite.
Therefore love moderately.
Long love doth so.
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Here comes the lady.
Oh, so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
A lover may bestride the gossamers That idles in the wanton summer air, And yet not fall.
So light is vanity.
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
