Some villain hath done me wrong.
That’s my fear.
I pray you, have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower.
And as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak.
Pray ye, go.
There’s my key.
If you do stir abroad, go armed.
Armed, brother?
Brother, I advise you to the best.
Go armed.
I am no honest man if there be any good meaning towards you.
I have told you what I have seen and heard—but faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it.
Pray you, away.
Shall I hear from you anon?
I do serve you in this business.
A credulous father, and a brother noble— Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none, on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy.
I see the business.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.
All with me’s meet that I can fashion fit.
