To her, Kate!
To her, widow!
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
That’s my office.
Spoke like an officer!
Ha' to thee, lad!
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
Head and butt!
An hasty-witted body Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
Ay, but not frighted me.
Therefore I’ll sleep again.
Nay, that you shall not.
Since you have begun, Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
Am I your bird?
I mean to shift my bush, And then pursue me as you draw your bow.— You are welcome all.
