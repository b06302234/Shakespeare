Come, high or low; Thyself and office deftly show!
Tell me, thou unknown power—      He knows thy thought.
Hear his speech but say thou nought.
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Beware Macduff.
Beware the thane of Fife.
Dismiss me.
Enough.
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks.
Thou hast harped my fear aright.
But one word more— He will not be commanded.
Here’s another More potent than the first.
Macbeth!
Macbeth!
Macbeth!— Had I three ears, I’d hear thee.
Be bloody, bold, and resolute.
Laugh to scorn The power of man, for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth.
