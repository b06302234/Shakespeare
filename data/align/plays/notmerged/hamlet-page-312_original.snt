I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence, but to know a man well were to know himself.
I mean, sir, for his weapon.
But in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he’s unfellowed.
What’s his weapon?
Rapier and dagger.
That’s two of his weapons.
But well.
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impawned, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns—as girdle, hangers, and so.
Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.
What call you the carriages?
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides.
I would it might be hangers till then.
But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages—that’s the French bet against the Danish.
Why is this “impawned,” as you call it?
The king, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits.
He hath laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
