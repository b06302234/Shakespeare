Which one of you killed the deer?
It was me, sir.
Let’s bring this man to the duke, like a triumphant Roman conqueror.
Put the deer’s horns on his head, like a victory branch.
Do you have a song, forester, for this occasion?
Yes, sir.
Then sing it.
It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough.
