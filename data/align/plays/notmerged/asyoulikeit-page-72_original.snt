And I mine.
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to Jane Smile.
And I remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked.
And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.” We that are true lovers run into strange capers.
But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.
Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.
Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion Is much upon my fashion.
And mine, but it grows something stale with me.
I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he for gold will give us any food.
I faint almost to death.
Peace, fool.
He’s not thy kinsman.
Who calls?
Your betters, sir.
Else are they very wretched.
