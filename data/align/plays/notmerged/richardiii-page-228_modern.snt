Wait.
Look back at the Tower with me.
Please, you ancient building, take pity on those tender babes locked inside your walls by envious rivals!
You are such a rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
You are a rude, ragged nurse and an old, sullen playmate for such tender princes.
Please treat my babies well.
I know I must look foolish saying goodbye to a building, but Iâ€™m aching with sorrow.
