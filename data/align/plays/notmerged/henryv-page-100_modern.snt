This is no time to have a discussion.
Christ!
The day is hot and between the weather and the wars and the king and the dukes, it’s no time for a discussion.
The town is besieged, and the trumpet calls us to the gap, and we talk and do nothing, by Christ.
It’s a disgrace to us all.
God save me, it’s a disgrace, by this hand, when there are throats to be cut and work to be done, and nothing gets done, Christ save me.
I swear by the mass, before I close my eyes to go to sleep, I’ll put in some good fighting, or I’ll lie in the ground dead.
And I’ll kill as valiantly as I can, that’s for sure.
That is the long and the short of it.
But truly, I would love to hear the two of you discuss warfare.
Captain Macmorris, I think, see—correct me if I’m wrong—there are not many of your nation— My nation?
What is my nation?
It’s a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal.
What is my nation?
Who talks of my nation?
Captain Macmorris, if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant, see, I’ll have to think you’re not treating me with the good will you ought to, see, since I am as good a man as yourself, both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects.
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself.
So, by Christ, I’ll cut off your head.
Now, now, both of you gentlemen!
You go out of your way to misunderstand each other.
