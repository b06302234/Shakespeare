You have weapons?
What’s going on here?
Stop it, I order you.
The next person to strike again dies.
What’s going on here?
These are the messengers from my sister and the king.
What are you fighting about?
Tell me.
I’m out of breath, sir.
No wonder, with all your exertions, you cowardly rascal.
You’re not worth being called a man.
The only thing manly about you are your clothes.
A tailor made you.
That’s an odd thing to say.
How can a tailor make a person?
Definitely a tailor, sir.
A sculptor or a painter couldn’t have screwed him up as bad as that, even as an apprentice.
But tell me what you’re fighting about.
This old ruffian here, whom I didn’t kill because he’s so old— You useless bastard—you’re like the letter “z,” a totally unnecessary addition to the alphabet.—My lord, please let me grind this lumpy lowlife into a powder and use it to plaster up the bathroom walls.—You didn’t kill me because I’m so old, you fawning dog?
Calm down.
Don’t you have any manners, you savage?
Yes, sir, but not when I’m enraged.
