Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word Macduff is fled to England.
Fled to England?
Ay, my good lord.
Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits.
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook Unless the deed go with it.
From this moment The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand.
And even now, To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done: The castle of Macduff I will surprise, Seize upon Fife, give to th' edge o' th' sword His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls That trace him in his line.
No boasting like a fool.
This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?
Come, bring me where they are.
