What willingly he did confound he wailed, Believe ’t, till I wept too.
You shall hear from me still.
The time shall not Outgo my thinking on you.
Come, sir, come, I’ll wrestle with you in my strength of love.
Look, here I have you.
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods.
Adieu.
Be happy.
To thy fair way.
Farewell, farewell.
Farewell.
