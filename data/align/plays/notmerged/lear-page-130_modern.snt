What’s that trumpet?
I know it.
It’s my sister’s.
She’ll be here soon, just like her letter said.
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for.—Get out of my sight, scoundrel!
What do you mean, your highness?
Who put my servant in the stocks?
Regan, I hope you didn’t know anything about that.—Ah, who’s this?
Dear gods, if you love old men like me, if you believe in obedience, if you yourselves are old, then please send me down some help!
Why shouldn’t she take my hand, father?
How exactly have I offended you?
Just because a senile man with poor judgment calls something an insult doesn’t necessarily mean it is one.
Oh, how can the sides of my body hold in my grieving heart?—How did my messenger wind up in the stocks?
