But if we fail— We, fail?
If you get your courage up, we can’t fail.
When Duncan is asleep—the day’s hard journey has definitely made him tired—I’ll get his two servants so drunk that their memory will go up in smoke through the chimneys of their brains.
When they lie asleep like pigs, so drunk they’ll be dead to the world, what won’t you and I be able to do to the unguarded Duncan?
And whatever we do, we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants.
May you only give birth to male children, because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn’t masculine.
Once we have covered the two servants with blood, and used their daggers to kill, won’t people believe that they were the culprits?
