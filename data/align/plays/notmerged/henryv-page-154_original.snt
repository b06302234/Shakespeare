We shall, my liege.
Shall I attend your Grace?
No, my good knight.
Go with my brothers to my lords of England.
I and my bosom must debate awhile, And then I would no other company.
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!
God-a-mercy, old heart, thou speak’st cheerfully.
Qui vous là?
A friend.
Discuss unto me: art thou officer or art thou base, common, and popular?
I am a gentleman of a company.
Trail’st thou the puissant pike?
Even so.
What are you?
As good a gentleman as the emperor.
