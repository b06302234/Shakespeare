Quiet, I say.
What does this mean?
It means that  Let’s walk over and see if the other soldiers heard the same thing.
Hello there, good sirs.
Yes.
Isn’t it strange?
Do you hear that, men?
Do you?
Let’s follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops.
Good idea.
It’s very strange.
