Fury, Fury!—There, Tyrant, there.
Hark, hark!
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews With agèd cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them Than pard or cat o' mountain.
Hark, they roar.
Let them be hunted soundly.
At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies.
Shortly shall all my labors end, and thou Shalt have the air at freedom.
For a little Follow, and do me service.
