Monstrous!
No, it was just a dream.

Just tell me this: have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it?
Yes, I gave her one like that.
It was my first gift to her.
I don’t know about that, but I saw a handkerchief like that today.
I’m sure it belongs to your wife, and I saw Cassio use it to wipe his beard.
If it’s the same one— If it’s the same one, or any one that belongs to her, then together with the other evidence it’s pretty strong.
