The best news of all is that we’ve located our king and our men.
The next bit of good news is that our ship—which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago—is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail.
These are unnatural events.
They get stranger all the time.— If I were sure I was wide awake, I’d try to tell you.
We were fast asleep and somehow—we don’t know how—we were stowed below deck, where we heard lots of roaring, shrieking, howling, and jingling chains.
The sounds were so horrible that we woke up liberated, and saw our wonderful ship safe and sound.
The master was dancing with joy to see it.
In an instant we were separated from them, as if in a dream, and brought here in a daze.
