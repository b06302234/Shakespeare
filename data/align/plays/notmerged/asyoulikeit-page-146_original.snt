As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a beggar?
Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is.
This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot.
Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
Come, sweet Audrey.
We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.â€”Farewell, good Master Oliver, not               'Tis no matter.
Ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.
