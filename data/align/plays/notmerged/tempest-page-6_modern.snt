Bring down that top sail!
Fast!
Lower, lower!
Let the ship sail close to the wind.
Damn those men shouting down there!
They’re louder than the storm or us sailors.
Oh, not you again.
What do you want?
Should we all give up and drown?
Do you want to sink?
Oh, go to hell, you loud-mouthed bastard!
Well, get to work, then.
Just die, you lowlife!
Go ahead and die, you nasty, rude bastard!You’re more scared of drowning than we are.
Yes, I guarantee he won’t drown—even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman.
Turn the ship to the wind!
Set the sails and let her go out to sea again!
It’s no use!
Pray for your lives!
We’re done for!
