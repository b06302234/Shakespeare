What is Thisbe?
A wandering knight?
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
Nay, faith, let me not play a woman.
I have a beard coming.
That’s all one.
You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too!
I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice: “Thisne, Thisne!”—“Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear, thy Thisbe dear and lady dear!” No, no.
You must play Pyramus.—And Flute, you Thisbe.
Well, proceed.
Robin Starveling, the tailor?
Here, Peter Quince.
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother.—Tom Snout, the tinker?
Here, Peter Quince.
You, Pyramus' father.—Myself, Thisbe’s father.—Snug the joiner, you, the lion’s part.—And I hope here is a play fitted.
