If this letter move him not, his legs cannot.
I’ll give ’t him.
You may have very fit occasion for ’t.
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart.
Go, Sir Andrew.
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily.
So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou drawest, swear horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him.
Away!
Nay, let me alone for swearing.
Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behavior of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding.
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less.
Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth.
He will find it comes from a clodpole.
But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity.
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.
