I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion.
Antony’s dead wife raised an army against him, as did his brother, though I don’t think Antony instigated it.
Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones.
If it weren’t for the fact that we oppose all three of them together, they’d be fighting each other.
They certainly have enough provocation.
But it’s possible the fear of us may mend their petty differences, though how that will work out, we cannot say.
It will be as the gods see fit.
In any case, our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible.
Let’s go, Menas.
