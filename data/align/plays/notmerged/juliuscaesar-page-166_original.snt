That you have wronged me doth appear in this: You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians, Wherein my letters, praying on his side Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment.
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm, To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers.
I “an itching palm”!
You know that you are Brutus that speak this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
Chastisement!
Remember March, the ides of March remember.
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
