Where’s Peaseblossom?
Here.
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?
Here.
Monsieur Cobweb, sir, get out your weapons and kill me a striped bumblebee on a thistle, and bring me its honey.

Oh, and monsieur, be careful not to break the honey-sac.
I’d hate to see you drowned in honey, sir.
Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed?
Here.
