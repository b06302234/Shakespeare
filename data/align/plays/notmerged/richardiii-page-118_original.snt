If you will live, lament.
If die, be brief, That our swift-wingèd souls may catch the king’s, Or, like obedient subjects, follow him To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow As I had title in thy noble husband.
I have bewept a worthy husband’s death And lived with looking on his images; But now two mirrors of his princely semblance Are cracked in pieces by malignant death, And I, for comfort, have but one false glass That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother, And hast the comfort of thy children left, But death hath snatched my husband from mine arms And plucked two crutches from my feeble hands, Clarence and Edward.
O, what cause have I, Thine being but a moiety of my moan, To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!
father’s death.
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned.
Your widow-dolor likewise be unwept!
Give me no help in lamentation.
I am not barren to bring forth complaints.
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes, That I, being governed by the watery moon, May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world.
Ah, for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
