I sincerely hope it does you good, mangy rascal.
No, don’t throw any of it away.
The skin is good for your cracked head.
When you see leeks in the future, I hope you keep mocking them.
That’s all.
Good.
Yes, leeks are good.
Wait, here’s a penny to heal your head.
Me, a penny?
Yes, and you’ll take it.
If not, I have another leek in my pocket that you can eat.
I’ll take this penny as a token that you’ll pay for this.
If I owe you anything, I’ll pay you in clubbings.
You’ll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me.
God be with you and keep you, and may he heal your head.
There’ll be hell to pay for this.
Go on, get out of here.
You’re a lying, cowardly wretch.
You mock an ancient tradition, born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died, and then have the gall not to stand by your words.
I’ve seen you bait and mock this man more than once.
You thought because he didn’t speak English like a native he couldn’t handle an English club.
You’ve learned otherwise.
Let this be a Welsh lesson to you to behave with English manners in the future.
Farewell.
