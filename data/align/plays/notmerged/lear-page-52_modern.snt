No, you’re just reminding me of something I’ve also noticed.
I’ve felt neglected recently, but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind.
I’ll look into it further.
But where’s my fool?
I haven’t seen him for two days.
Ever since Cordelia left for France, sir, the fool has been depressed.
Let’s not talk about it.
I’ve noticed it myself.
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her.
And you, go call my fool.
You there, sir, come here please.
Who am I, sir?
The father of the lady of the house, sir.
The father of the lady of the house”?
You scoundrel!
You lowlife son-of-a-bitch!
You dog, you peasant!
I’m sorry, sir, but I’m not any of those things.
Are you making faces at me, you scoundrel?
I won’t be hit, my lord.
