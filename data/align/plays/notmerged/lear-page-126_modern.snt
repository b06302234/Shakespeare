Calm down, sir, please.
I hope there’s been a misunderstanding.
It’s more likely that you don’t know how to appreciate her than that she’d ever fail in her duties as a daughter.
How do you mean?
I can’t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way.
If she restrained your rowdy knights, she had such a good reason that you can’t blame her for it.
I curse her.
Sir, you’re old.
Your life is stretched to its limit.
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what’s good for you.
Please go back to Goneril’s house.
Admit you were wrong.
Apologize?
Do you think this kind of thing is appropriate for the royal family?
No more, please.
These are ugly antics.
Go back to my sister’s.
