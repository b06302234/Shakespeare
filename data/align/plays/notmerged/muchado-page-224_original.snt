Now, unto thy bones good night!
Yearly will I do this rite.
Good morrow, masters.
Put your torches out.
The wolves have preyed, and look, the gentle day, Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
Thanks to you all, and leave us.
Fare you well.
Good morrow, masters.
Each his several way.
Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds, And then to Leonato’s we will go.
And Hymen now with luckier issue speed ’s Than this for whom we rendered up this woe.
