creet.
She doesn’t want Orsino’s ring!
Orsino never sent her a ring.
I’m the man she wants.
If that’s true, which it is, she might as well be in love with a dream, the poor lady.
Now I understand why it’s bad to wear disguises.
Disguises help the devil do his work.
It’s so easy for a good-looking but deceitful man to make women fall in love with him.
It’s not our fault—we women are weak.
We can’t help what we’re made of.
Ah, how will this all turn out?
My lord loves her, and.
poor me, I love him just as much.
And she’s deluded enough to be in love with me.
What can possibly fix this situation?
I’m pretending to be a man, so my love for the Duke is hopeless.
And since I’m a woman—too bad I’m a woman—Olivia’s love for me is hopeless as well!
Oh, only time can sort out this mess.
I can’t figure it out by myself!
