He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep.
He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep.
The general should be informed about this.
Maybe he’s never noticed, or he only wants to see Cassio’s good side.
Don’t you think so?
And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command.
We should definitely say something to the Moor.
I wouldn’t say anything, not if you gave me the whole island for doing so.
I respect Cassio and I’d like to help cure his alcoholism— What’s that noise?
