I’ll fight every one of these devils if I have to, one at a time.
I’ll back you up.
All three of them are crazy with despair.
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them, like a slow-acting poison.
Those of you who are young and active, I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do.
Follow them, please.
