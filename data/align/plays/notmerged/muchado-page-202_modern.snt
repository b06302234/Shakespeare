Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina.
The three of you have killed a sweet, innocent woman.
Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel, and good luck to him then.
He’s serious.
Very serious, and I’m sure it’s because of Beatrice.
And he challenged you to a duel?
He did, very sincerely.
What a strange sight—a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home!
A guy like that is bigger than an ape, but the ape could be his doctor, it’s so much smarter.
But wait a minute.
Let me gather my wits and get serious here.
Didn’t he say my brother has run away?
Come on, you.
If they let you off, then we’ll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power.
Since you are a lying hypocrite, we must look after you.
What’s this?
Two of my brother’s men, all tied up!
And Borachio is one of them!
