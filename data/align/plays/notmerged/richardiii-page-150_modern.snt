What, my dear lord?
If I live to be a man, I’ll win    Making good time, here’s the duke of York.
Richard of York, how are you doing, my loving brother?
Very well, my supreme lord—that’s what I have to call you now.
Yes, brother, I feel bad about that, too.
The man who might have kept that title died too soon, and now it isn’t worth nearly as much.
How’s my nephew doing, noble lord of York?
Thank you for asking, uncle.
Oh, my lord, you once said that lazy weeds grow fast.
The prince has far outgrown me.
He has, my lord.
Does that mean he’s lazy?
