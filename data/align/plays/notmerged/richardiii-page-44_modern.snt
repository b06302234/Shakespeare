Here come Lord Buckingham and Lord Derby.
I hope God makes you happy again, like you once were.
My good Lord Derby, the countess Richmond would hardly say  Please don’t believe the false rumors you’ve heard about her feelings toward you, or if they’re true, then forgive her, since she’s only acting that way because she’s sick, not because she hates you.
Did you see the king today, Lord Derby?
Yes, the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him.
What are the chances of his getting better, lords?
Madam, keep up hope.
He seems cheerful.
