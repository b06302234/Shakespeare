When I was relaxing, she’d pull me aside and ask to hear some part of a story she had missed.
Her eyes would fill with tears at the bad things I went through in my younger years.
When my stories were done, she’d sigh and tell me how strangely wonderful and sad my life had been.
She said she wished she hadn’t heard it, but she also wished there was a man like me for her.
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell, she’d fall in love with him.
I took the hint and spoke to her.
She said she loved me for the dangers I’d survived, and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me.
That’s the only witchcraft I ever used.
Here comes my wife now.
She’ll confirm everything.
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over.
Brabantio, I urge you to make the best of this.
Try to accept what’s happened.
