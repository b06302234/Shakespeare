That’s all there is to it.
As soon as the deed is done, you will be in my favor and I will promote you.
I’ll do it right away.
My lord, I have thought over the request you just made of me.
Well, it doesn’t matter anymore.
Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond.
I heard the news, my lord.
Stanley, Richmond is your wife’s son.
Get information from her.
My lord, I’d want to have the gift you promised me on your honor: the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it.
Stanley, pay attention to your wife’s doings.
If she sends any letters to Richmond, you will be accountable to me for it.
What do you say, your Highness, about my just request?
