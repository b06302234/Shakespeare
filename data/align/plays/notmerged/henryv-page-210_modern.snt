It’s expressly against the rules of combat.
It’s as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up.

I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born.
I tell you, Captain, if you look at a map of the world, I’ll bet you will find, comparing Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, see, are very similar.
