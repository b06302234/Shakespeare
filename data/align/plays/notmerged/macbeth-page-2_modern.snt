When should the three of us meet again?
Will it be in thunder, lightning, or rain?
We’ll meet when the noise of the battle is over, when one side has won and the other side has lost.
That will happen before sunset.
Where should we meet?
Let’s do it in the open field.
We’ll meet Macbeth there.
My toad, Paddock, calls me.
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.
Let’s fly away through the fog and filthy air.
