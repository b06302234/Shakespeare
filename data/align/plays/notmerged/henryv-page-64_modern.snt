And now, my lords, off to France.
This invasion will be as glorious to you as it is to me.
I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war, since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot.
I’m now sure that every bump in the road has been removed.
Let’s go forth, dear countrymen.
Our strength is God.
Let’s get going.
We’re off to sea, banners flying.
I’ll be no king of England if I’m not also king of France.
