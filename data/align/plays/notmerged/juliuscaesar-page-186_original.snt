I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so.
Well, to our work alive.
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently?
I do not think it good.
Your reason?
This it is: 'Tis better that the enemy seek us.
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still, Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
Good reasons must of force give place to better.
The people ’twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection, For they have grudged us contribution.
The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged, From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back.
Hear me, good brother— Under your pardon.
You must note beside, That we have tried the utmost of our friends, Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.
The enemy increaseth every day.
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures.
