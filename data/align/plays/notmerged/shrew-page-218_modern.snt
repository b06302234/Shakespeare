I believe I have some choice in the matter, sir.
Come here, you wretch!
What, have you forgotten me?
Forgotten you!
No, sir.
I could not forget you, since I never saw you before in my life.
Despicable brute!
Never seen your masterâ€™s father, Vincentio?
My honorable, reverend master?
Yes, of course.
There he is at the window.
Is that so?
Help, help, help!
This madman will murder me.
