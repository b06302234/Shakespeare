If ever he have wife, let her be made More miserable by the death of him Than I am made by my poor lord and thee.— Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load, Taken from Paul’s to be interrèd there.
And still, as you are weary of this weight, Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry’s corse.
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds?
Villains, set down the corse or, by Saint Paul, I’ll make a corse of him that disobeys.
My lord, stand back and let the coffin pass.
Unmannered dog, stand thou when I command!— Advance thy halberd higher than my breast, Or by Saint Paul I’ll strike thee to my foot And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
