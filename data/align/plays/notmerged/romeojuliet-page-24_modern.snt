You wouldn’t tell a sick man he “seriously” has to make his will—it would just make him worse.
Seriously, cousin, I love a woman.
I guessed that already when I guessed you were in love.
Then you were right on target.
The woman I love is beautiful.
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest.
Well, you’re not on target there.
She refuses to be hit by  So she’s made a vow to be a virgin forever?
Yes she has, and by keeping celibate, she wastes her beauty.
If you starve yourself of sex you can’t ever have children, and so your beauty is lost to future generations.
She’s too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven’s blessing by making me despair.
She’s sworn off love, and that promise has left me alive but dead, living only to talk about it now.
Take my advice.
Don’t think about her.
Teach me to forget to think!
