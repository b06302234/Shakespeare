For I am she, and altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out In sharing that which you have pilled from me!
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
If not, that I am queen, you bow like subjects, Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels.— Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away.
Foul, wrinkled witch, what mak’st thou in my sight?
But repetition of what thou hast marred.
That will I make before I let thee go.
Wert thou not banishèd on pain of death?
I was, but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou ow’st to me;   And thou a kingdom; —all of you, allegiance.
The sorrow that I have by right is yours, And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
The curse my noble father laid on thee When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper, And with thy scorns drew’st rivers from his eyes, And then, to dry them, gav’st the duke a clout Steeped in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland— His curses then, from bitterness of soul Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee, And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
