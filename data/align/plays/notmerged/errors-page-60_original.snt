Here’s too much “out upon thee!” I pray thee, let me in.
Well, I’ll break in.
Go, borrow me a crow.
A crow without feather?
Master, mean you so?
For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a feather.—   Go, get thee gone.
Fetch me an iron crow.
Have patience, sir.
O, let it not be so.
Herein you war against your reputation, And draw within the compass of suspect Th' unviolated honor of your wife.
Once this: your long experience of her wisdom, Her sober virtue, years, and modesty Plead on her part some cause to you unknown.
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Be ruled by me; depart in patience, And let us to the Tiger all to dinner, And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint.
If by strong hand you offer to break in Now in the stirring passage of the day, A vulgar comment will be made of it; And that supposèd by the common rout Against your yet ungallèd estimation That may with foul intrusion enter in And dwell upon your grave when you are dead; For slander lives upon succession, Forever housèd where it gets possession.
