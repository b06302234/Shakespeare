God save the foundation!
Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.
I leave an arrant knave with your Worship, which I beseech your Worship to correct yourself, for the example of others.
God keep your Worship!
I wish your Worship well.
God restore you to health!
I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it!— Come, neighbor.
Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.
Farewell, my lords.
We look for you tomorrow.
We will not fail.
Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.
Bring you these fellows on.—We’ll talk with Margaret, How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.
