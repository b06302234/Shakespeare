You must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
Yonder sure they are coming.
Let us now stay and see it.
Come on.
Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.
Is yonder the man?
Even he, madam.
Alas, he is too young.
Yet he looks successfully.
How now, daughter and cousin?
Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?
Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man.
In pity of the challenger’s youth, I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.
Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
Do so.
I’ll not be by.
