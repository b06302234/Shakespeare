Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signor Benedick?
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence.
Then is courtesy a turncoat.
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted.
And I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.
A dear happiness to women.
They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.
I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humor for that.
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.
God keep your Ladyship still in that mind, so some gentle- man or other shall ’scape a predestinate scratched face.
Scratching could not make it worse an ’twere such a face as yours were.
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer.
But keep your way, i' God’s name.
I have done.
You always end with a jade’s trick.
I know you of old.
That is the sum of all, Leonato.—Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all.
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer.
I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart.
