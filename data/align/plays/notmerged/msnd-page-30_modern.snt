I’ll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard, or a sandy beard, or a red beard, or one of those bright yellow beards that’s the color of a French coin.
Some French people don’t have beards at all, because syphilis has made all their hair fall out, so you might have to play the part clean-shaven.—But gentlemen, here are your scripts, and I beg you to please learn them by tomorrow night.
Meet me in the duke’s forest a mile outside of town.
It’s best to rehearse there, because if we do it here in the city, we’ll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play.
Meanwhile, I’ll make a list of props that we’ll need for the play.
Now make sure you show up, all of you.
Don’t leave me in the lurch.
We’ll be there, and there we’ll rehearse courageously and wonderfully, truly obscenely.
Work hard, know your lines.
Goodbye.
We’ll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke’s forest.
Got it?
Be there, or don’t show your face again.
