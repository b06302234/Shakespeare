And that is Claudio.
I know him by his bearing.
You know me well.
I am he.
Signor, you are very near my brother in his love.
He is enamored on Hero.
I pray you, dissuade him from her.
She is no equal for his birth.
You may do the part of an honest man in it.
How know you he loves her?
I heard him swear his affection.
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.
Come, let us to the banquet.
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
Tis certain so, the Prince woos for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love.
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues.
Let every eye nogetiate for itself And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
This is an accident of hourly proof, Which I mistrusted not.
Farewell, therefore, Hero.
