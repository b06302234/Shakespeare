Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened.
This is now a Rome in mourning, a dangerous Rome.
It’s not safe enough for Octavius yet.
Hurry away and tell him so.
No, wait, stay a minute.
Don’t go back until I’ve carried the corpse into the marketplace.
There I’ll use my speech to test what the people think of these bloody men’s cruel action.
You’ll report back to young Octavius how they respond.
Help me here.
