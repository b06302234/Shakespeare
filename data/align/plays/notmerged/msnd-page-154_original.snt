So please your grace, the Prologue is addressed.
Let him approach.
If we offend, it is with our good will.
That you should think we come not to offend, But with good will.
To show our simple skill, That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then we come but in despite.
We do not come as minding to contest you, Our true intent is.
All for your delight We are not here.
That you should here repent you, The actors are at hand, and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know.
This fellow doth not stand upon points.
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt.
He knows not the stop.
A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.
Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorderâ€”a sound, but not in government.
