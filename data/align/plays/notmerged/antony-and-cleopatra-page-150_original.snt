Where is the fellow?
Half afeard to come.
Go to, go to.—Come hither, sir.
Good majesty, Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased.
That Herod’s head I’ll have!
But how?
When Antony is gone, Through whom I might command it?
Most gracious majesty!
Didst thou behold Octavia?
Ay, dread Queen.
Where?
Madam, in Rome.
I looked her in the face, and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony.
Is she as tall as me?
She is not, madam.
Didst hear her speak?
Is she shrill-tongued or low?
Madam, I heard her speak.
She is low-voiced.
That’s not so good.
He cannot like her long.
