She never reprehended him but mildly When he demeaned himself rough, rude, and wildly.â€”   She did betray me to my own reproof.
Good people, enter and lay hold on him.
No, not a creature enters in my house.
Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
Neither: he took this place for sanctuary, And it shall privilege him from your hands Till I have brought him to his wits again Or lose my labor in assaying it.
I will attend my husband, be his nurse, Diet his sickness, for it is my office And will have no attorney but myself; And therefore let me have him home with me.
Be patient, for I will not let him stir Till I have used the approvd means I have, With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers, To make of him a formal man again.
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath, A charitable duty of my order.
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
I will not hence and leave my husband here; And ill it doth beseem your holiness To separate the husband and the wife.
