Were now the general of our gracious empress, As in good time he may, from Ireland coming, Bringing rebellion broached on his sword, How many would the peaceful city quit To welcome him!
Much more, and much more cause, Did they this Harry.
Now in London place him (As yet the lamentation of the French Invites the king of England’s stay at home; The emperor’s coming in behalf of France To order peace between them) and omit All the occurrences, whatever chanced, Till Harry’s back return again to France.
There must we bring him, and myself have played The interim, by remembering you ’tis past.
Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance After your thoughts, straight back again to France.
