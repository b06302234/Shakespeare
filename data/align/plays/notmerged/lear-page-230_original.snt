I may not, madam.
My lady charged my duty in this business.
Why should she write to Edmund?
Might not you Transport her purposes by word?
Belike Some things—I know not what.
I’ll love thee much.
Let me unseal the letter.
Madam, I had rather— I know your lady does not love her husband.
I am sure of that.
And at her late being here She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks To noble Edmund.
I know you are of her bosom.
I, madam?
I speak in understanding.
Y' are.
I know ’t.
Therefore I do advise you, take this note.
My lord is dead.
Edmund and I have talked, And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady’s.
You may gather more.
If you do find him, pray you give him this.
And when your mistress hears thus much from you, I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.
So fare you well.
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor, Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
Would I could meet him, madam, I should show What party I do follow.
Fare thee well.
