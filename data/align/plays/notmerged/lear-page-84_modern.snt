Hello, Curan.
Hello, sir.
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight.
Why is that?
I don’t know.
Have you heard the latest news?—I mean the whispered rumors, since that’s all they are at this point.
No, I haven’t.
What’s going on?
You haven’t heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
Not a word.
You may hear about it soon.
Goodbye, sir.
The duke will be here tonight?
All the better—in fact it’s the best that could happen.
His arrival fits perfectly into my plan.
My father’s ready to arrest my brother, and I have one risky thing to do.
Fast work and a little luck are all I need.—Brother, could I have a word with you?
Come down, brother.
