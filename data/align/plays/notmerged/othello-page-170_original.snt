Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
Why, man?
He’s a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies, ’tis stabbing.
Go to.
Where lodges he?
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
Can anything be made of this?
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions, and by them answer.
Seek him, bid him come hither.
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
To do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.
