Oh, it’s horrible, horrible.
I thought the clouds were talking to me, the winds were singing to me, and the thunder, like an awful organ pipe, roared Prospero’s name.
It sang about my crimes.
Because of my crimes my son is dead on the ocean floor.
I’ll go join him there, going down deeper than any anchor ever sank, and lie with him dead in the mud.
