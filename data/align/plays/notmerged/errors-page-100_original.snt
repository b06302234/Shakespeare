As if time were in debt.
How fondly dost thou reason!
Time is a very bankrout and owes more than he’s worth to   season.
Nay, he’s a thief too.
Have you not heard men say That time comes stealing on by night and day?
If he be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way, Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
Go, Dromio.
There’s the money.
Bear it straight, And bring thy master home immediately.
Come, sister, I am pressed down with conceit: Conceit, my comfort and my injury.
