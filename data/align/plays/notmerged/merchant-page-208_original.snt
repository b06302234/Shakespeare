None but a holy hermit and her maid.
I pray you, is my master yet returned?
He is not, nor we have not heard from him.— But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica, And ceremoniously let us prepare Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
Sola, sola!
Wo, ha, ho!
Sola, sola!
Who calls?
Sola!
Did you see Master Lorenzo?
Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!
Leave holloaing, man.
Here.
Sola!
Where, where?
Here.
Tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news.
My master will be here ere morning.
Sweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming.
And yet no matter.
Why should we go in?— My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you, Within the house, your mistress is at hand.
And bring your music forth into the air.
