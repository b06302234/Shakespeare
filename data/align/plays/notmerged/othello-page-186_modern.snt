Why are you so far from home?
How are you, my pretty Bianca?
To tell you the truth, I was just going to your house.
And I was just going to yours.
You’ve kept away from me for a week?
Seven days and seven nights?
A hundred and sixty-eight hours?
And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones!
What a tedious wait!
I’m sorry, Bianca.
All this time I’ve been depressed and had problems on my mind.
When I get some free time I’ll make it up to you.
Oh, Cassio, where did you get this?
This is a gift from another woman, a new lover!
Now I know why you’ve been staying away from me.
Has it come to this?
Well, well.
Oh, come on, woman.
Stop jumping to silly conclusions.
Now you’re jealous, thinking that this is from some mistress of mine, but I swear it’s not, Bianca.
Well, whose is it?
I don’t even know.
I found it in my room.
It’s pretty.
Someone is certainly looking for it, and I’ll have to give it back.
So I’d like it copied.
Take it and do that for me, and leave me alone for a while.
Leave you alone!
Why?
