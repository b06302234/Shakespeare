The skies, the fountains, every region near Seemed all one mutual cry.
I never heard So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, So flewed, so sanded, and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew, Crook-kneed, and dew-lapped like Thessalian bulls, Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells, Each under each.
A cry more tunable Was never hollaed to, nor cheered with horn, In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.
Judge when you hear.
But, soft!
What nymphs are these?
My lord, this is my daughter here asleep.
And this, Lysander.
This Demetrius is.
This Helena, old Nedarâ€™s Helena.
I wonder of their being here together.
No doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May, and hearing our intent Came here in grace our solemnity.
But speak, Egeus.
Is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
It is, my lord.
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
Good morrow, friends.
Saint Valentine is past.
