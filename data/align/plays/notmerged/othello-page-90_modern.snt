Yes, she’s young and tender.
And such pretty eyes!
Like an invitation.
Yes, she’s pretty.
But she’s modest and ladylike too.
And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up passion?
She’s a perfect woman, it’s true.
Well, good luck to them tonight in bed!
Come with us, lieutenant.
I’ve got a jug of wine, and these two Cyprus gentlemen want to drink a toast to the black Othello.
Not tonight, Iago.
I’m not much of a drinker.
I wish there was less social pressure to drink.
Oh, but these are our friends.
Just one glass.
I’ll do most of the drinking for you.
I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down, but look how drunk I am.
I’m not a heavy drinker.
I wouldn’t dare drink much more than that.
What are you talking about, man?
Tonight is for celebrating!
The gentlemen are waiting.
Where are they?
By the door.
Please invite them in.
I’ll do it, but I don’t like it.
