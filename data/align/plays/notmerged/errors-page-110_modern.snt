Don’t worry, man, I won’t try to escape.
When it’s time for me to be freed, I’ll pay you the fee you’re entitled to for arresting me.
My wife’s in a perverse mood today.
She’ll be suspicious when the messenger tells her that I was arrested.
I tell you, this will make her angry when she hears about it.
Here’s my servant.
I think he’s got the money.
Hello there, sir!
Do you have what I told you to get?
Yes.
And this rope will take care of everybody, I guarantee it.
But where’s the money?
Why, sir, I spent it on this rope.
You idiot!
Five hundred ducats for a rope?
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price.
Why did I just send you home?
To get a piece of rope.
And here I am, with that piece.
And I’ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with.
