The watchdogs bark.
Hark, hark!
I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry “Cock-a-diddle-dow.” Where should this music be?
I' th' air or th' earth?
It sounds no more, and sure, it waits upon Some god o' th' island.
Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the king my father’s wrack, This music crept by me upon the waters, Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air.
Thence I have followed it, Or it hath drawn me rather.
But ’tis gone.
No, it begins again.
