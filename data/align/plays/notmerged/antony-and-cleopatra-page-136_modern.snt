We’ll have a rematch at your feast on shore.
Yes, we will.
Let’s shake on it.
Oh, Antony, even if you’ve taken my father’s house, what is that to me?
We’re friends!
Come, this way to the rowboat.
Be careful not to fall in.
Menas, I’m not going back on shore.
No, come to my cabin.
We’ll have the musicians play drums, trumpets, flutes.
What do you say?
We’ll make  Hooray, I say.
There’s my hat!
Hooray!
Come on, noble captain.
