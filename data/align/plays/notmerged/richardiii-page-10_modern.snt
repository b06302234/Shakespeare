We know you have a job to do, Brakenbury, and we’ll do what you say.
We are required to serve the queen, and we must obey her.
Farewell, brother.
I will go to the king and do whatever you want me to, even if it’s to call my brother’s wife “sister,” in order to set you free.
But just so you know, I am very angry about how our own brother has treated you, angrier than you can imagine.
It doesn’t make either of us happy, I know.
Well, your imprisonment won’t last long.
I will either get you out, lying if I have to, or stay in prison in your place.
In the meantime, be patient.
I have no choice.
Goodbye.
Go walk the path that you will never return from.
Dumb, honest Clarence.
I love you so much that I’ll send your soul to heaven very soon—if heaven will accept anything from me, that is.
But who’s coming?
The newly released Hastings?
Good afternoon, my dear lord!
The same to you, my lord!
Welcome to the open air again.
How did you tolerate prison?
