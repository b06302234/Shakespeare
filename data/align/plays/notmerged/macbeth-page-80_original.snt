How goes the world, sir, now?
Why, see you not?
Is ’t known who did this more than bloody deed?
Those that Macbeth hath slain.
Alas, the day!
What good could they pretend?
They were suborned.
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king’s two sons, Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed.
Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition, that will raven up Thine own lives' means!
Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested.
Where is Duncan’s body?
Carried to Colmekill, The sacred storehouse of his predecessors, And guardian of their bones.
Will you to Scone?
No, cousin, I’ll to Fife.
Well, I will thither.
