Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe, about what we’ve seen two nights now.
Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us.
Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and I— Quiet, shut up!
It’s come again.
Looking just like the dead king.
Doesn’t he look like the king, Horatio?
Very much so.
It’s terrifying.
It wants us to speak to it.
Ask it something, Horatio.
What are you, that you walk out so late at night, looking like the dead king of Denmark when he dressed for battle?
By God, I order you to speak.
