With who?
Why, with my lord, madam.
Who is thy lord?
He that is yours, sweet lady.
I have none.
Do not talk to me, Emilia.
I cannot weep, nor answers have I none, But what should go by water.
Prithee, tonight Lay on my bed my wedding sheets.
Remember, And call thy husband hither.
Here’s a change indeed!
Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved that he might stick The small’st opinion on my least misuse?
What is your pleasure, madam?
How is ’t with you?
I cannot tell.
Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.
He might have chid me so, for, in good faith, I am a child to chiding.
What is the matter, lady?
