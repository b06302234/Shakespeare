Let’s to bed, knight.
Thou hadst need send for more money.
If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
Send for money, knight.
If thou hast her not i' the end, call me “Cut.”  If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.
Come, come, I’ll go burn some sack.
Tis too late to go to bed now.
Come, knight.
Come, knight.
