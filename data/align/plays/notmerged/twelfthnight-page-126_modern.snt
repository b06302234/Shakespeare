Taste my legs?
My legs stand under me, but I don’t understand what “taste your legs” means.
I mean please go into the house, sir.
I will.
But now we don’t have to!
Oh, beautiful and accomplished lady, may the heavens rain odors upon you!
My message is not for anyone else to hear, my lady.
It’s only for your willing and receptive ear.
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message.
Give me your hand, sir.
I give you my obedience and my humble service, madam.
What’s your name?
