It’s clear, every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death.
The king is not responsible for it.
I don’t expect him to answer for me, and yet I’m determined to fight vigorously for him.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
Sure, he said so to make us fight cheerfully.
But when our throats are cut, he could be ransomed without our being any the wiser.
If I live to see it, I’ll never trust his word again.
Yeah, right, go get him.
That’s a lame threat from a toy gun, a poor individual’s private displeasure with a monarch.
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather.
You’ll “never trust his word again.” Come on, that was a stupid thing to say.
Your scolding is somewhat overblown.
I’d be angry with you if the occasion allowed.
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
