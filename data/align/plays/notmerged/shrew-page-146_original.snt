Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways!
Was ever man so beaten?
Was ever man so 'rayed?
Was ever man so weary?
I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them.
Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me.
But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself.
For, considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.—Holla, ho!
Curtis!
Who is that calls so coldly?
A piece of ice.
If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck.
A fire, good Curtis.
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
Oh, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire.
Cast on no water.
Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?
