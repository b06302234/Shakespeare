If I wake up too early, won’t I go insane with all these horrible, frightening things around me, start playing with my ancestors' bones, and pull Tybalt’s corpse out of his death shroud?
Will I grab one of my dead ancestor’s bones and bash in my own skull?
Oh, look!
I think I see my cousin Tybalt’s ghost.
He’s looking for Romeo because Romeo killed him with his sword.
Wait, Tybalt, wait!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo!
Here’s a drink.
I drink to you.
