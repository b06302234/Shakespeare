No, not a chance.
You’re supposed to be here in Padua studying.
So who would fill in for you—pretend to be Vincentio’s son, live in his house, pore over his books, welcome his friends, and wine and dine his fellow expatriates from Pisa?
Enough!
Don’t worry, I have it all figured out.
No one has seen us yet, and no one knows what we look like—which of us is master and which servant.
It’s obvious:  Here comes Biondello.
Where have you been, boy?
Where have  Come here, boy.
It’s no time for jokes: sober up.
Tranio and I have traded clothes to save my life.
I killed a man in a fight since we came ashore, and I’m worried someone saw me.
While I make my escape, I need you to wait on Tranio as though he were me.
Understand?
Of course, sir.
And you’re not to utter a syllable of Tranio’s name.
Tranio” is now “Lucentio.” Lucky for him.
Wish I could say the same.
I’d second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptista’s youngest daughter.
This is for your master’s sake, not mine.
So watch your step when there are other people around.
When we’re by ourselves you can call me “Tranio.” Everywhere else, address me as your master Lucentio.
