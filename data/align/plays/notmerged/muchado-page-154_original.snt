What do you mean, my lord?
Not to be married, Not to knit my soul to an approvèd wanton.
Dear my lord, if you in your own proof Have vanquished the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity— I know what you would say: if I have known her, You will say she did embrace me as a husband, And so extenuate the forehand sin.
No, Leonato, I never tempted her with word too large But, as a brother to his sister, showed Bashful sincerity and comely love.
And seemed I ever otherwise to you?
Out on thee, seeming!
I will write against it.
You seem to me as Dian in her orb, As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown.
But you are more intemperate in your blood Than Venus, or those pampered animals That rage in savage sensuality.
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
Sweet Prince, why speak not you?
What should I speak?
I stand dishonored, that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale.
Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
