I’m coming.
Lysander, say something!
You coward, did you run away from me?
Say something!
Are you behind some bush?
Where are you hiding?
Are you there?
He’s walking ahead of me, and he keeps daring me to follow him.
When I reach the place he’s calling from, he disappears.
This villain is much quicker than I am.
I ran after him fast, but he ran away from me faster, so that now here I am in some dark part of the forest where the ground is uneven.
