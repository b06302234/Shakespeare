Thou dost me yet but little hurt.
Thou wilt anon, I know it by thy trembling.
Now Prosper works upon thee.
Come on your ways.
Open your mouth.
Here is that which will give language to you, cat.
Open your mouth.
This will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly.
You cannot tell who’s your friend.
Open your chaps again.
I should know that voice.
It should be—But he is drowned, and these are devils.
Oh, defend me!
Four legs and two voices—a most delicate monster.
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend.
His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague.
Come.
CALIBAN  Amen!
I will pour some in thy other mouth.
Stephano!
Doth thy other mouth call me?
Mercy, mercy!
This is a devil, and no monster.
I will leave him.
I have no long spoon.
Stephano!
If thou beest Stephano, touch me and speak to me.
For I am Trinculo—be not afeard—thy good friend Trinculo.
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth.
I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs.
If any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they.
