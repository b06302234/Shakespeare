To be honest, I’ve never known Caesar to let his emotions get the better of his reason.
But everyone knows that an ambitious young man uses humility to advance himself, but when he reaches the top, he turns his back on his supporters and reaches for the skies while scorning those who helped him get where he is.
Caesar might act like that.
Therefore, in case he does, we must hold him back.
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior, not what he does now, I must frame the argument like this: if his position is furthered, his character will fulfill these predictions.
And therefore we should liken him to a serpent’s egg—once it has hatched, it becomes dangerous, like all serpents.
Thus we must kill him while he’s still in the shell.

I don’t know, sir.
