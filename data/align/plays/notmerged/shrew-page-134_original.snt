Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster Doth watch Bianca’s steps so narrowly, 'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage, Which, once performed, let all the world say no, I’ll keep mine own despite of all the world.
That by degrees we mean to look into And watch our vantage in this business.
We’ll overreach the graybeard, Gremio, The narrow-prying father, Minola, The quaint musician, amorous Litio, All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
A bridegroom, say you?
Tis a groom indeed, A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
Why, he’s a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
