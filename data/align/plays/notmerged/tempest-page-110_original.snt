There be some sports are painful, and their labor Delight in them sets off.
Some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone.
And most poor matters Point to rich ends.
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious, but The mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead And makes my labors pleasures.
Oh, she is Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed, And he’s composed of harshness.
I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up, Upon a sore injunction.
My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness Had never like executor.
I forget, But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors, Most busiest when I do it.
Alas now, pray you, Work not so hard.
I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!
Pray, set it down and rest you.
When this burns, 'Twill weep for having wearied you.
My father Is hard at study.
Pray now, rest yourself.
He’s safe for these three hours.
