No, my dearest love, I wouldn’t cheat you for the whole world.
Maybe not the whole world, but you’d cheat for twenty kingdoms.
But even then I’d still lie and say you were playing by the rules.
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up, then I’ll lose my son twice.
A wonderful miracle!
