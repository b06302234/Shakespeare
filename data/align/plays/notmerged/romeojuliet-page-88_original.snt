And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep.
The more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within.
Dear love, adieu.— Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little.
I will come again.
O blessèd, blessèd night!
I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honorable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow By one that I’ll procure to come to thee Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite, And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I come, anon.—But if thou mean’st not well, I do beseech thee—
