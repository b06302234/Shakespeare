I can’t stand her.
Please, my lord, don’t be friendly with her.
Don’t worry about me.—Your sister and the duke are here.
My dear and loving sister-in-law, I’m happy to see you.
Noble words, sir.
Why are we talking about this?
We must join forces against the enemy.
Our domestic squabbles are not the issue here.
Then let’s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next.
I’ll meet you at your tent.
Goneril, are you coming with us?
