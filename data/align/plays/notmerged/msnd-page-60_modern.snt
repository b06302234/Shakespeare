Stay here at your own risk.
I’m going on alone.
Oh, I’m out of breath from this foolish chase.
The more I pray, the less I get out of it.
Hermia is lucky, wherever she is, because she has beautiful eyes.
How did her eyes get so bright?
Not from crying.
If that’s the case, tears wash my eyes more than hers.
No, no, I’m as ugly as a bear, since animals that see me run away in terror.
So it’s no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster.
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia’s starry eyes?
Don’t say that, Lysander.
Don’t say that.
Why do you care that he loves Hermia?
What does it matter?
Hermia still loves you, so be happy.
Happy with Hermia?
No.
I regret all the boring time I wasted with her.
I don’t love Hermia; I love Helena.
Who wouldn’t love a dove more than a crow?
A man’s desires are influenced by his logical mind, and it’s simply logical that you’re more worthy of love than Hermia is.
