Welcome, my lord.
I’m surprised my bland husband didn’t meet me on the way here.
Where’s your master?
He’s inside, ma'am, but he has changed dramatically since you last saw him.
When I told him that the invading army has landed, he just smiled at me.
When I told him you were on your way, he replied, “Too bad.” When I told him about Gloucester’s betrayal and his son Edmund’s loyal service, he called me an idiot and said I had it all wrong.
He was delighted by the bad news and disgusted by the good news.
