There’s no trust, No faith, no honesty in men.
All perjured, All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where’s my man?—Give me some aqua vitae.— These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish!
He was not born to shame.
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit, For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned.
Sole monarch of the universal earth, Oh, what a beast was I to chide at him!
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, When I, thy three hours' wife, have mangled it?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have killed my husband.
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring.
Your tributary drops belong to woe, Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain, And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
All this is comfort.
Wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death, That murdered me.
I would forget it fain, But oh, it presses to my memory, Like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners' minds.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banishèd.”
