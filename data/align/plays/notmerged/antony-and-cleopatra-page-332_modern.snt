Good Queen, let me implore youâ€” Oh, Caesar, I am so ashamed.
You condescended to visit me here, honoring my humble self with your lordly presence.
And one of my own servants increases my disgrace by adding his envy!
Suppose, good Caesar, that I have saved a few feminine trifles, some unimportant trinkets.
These have worth only as gifts to friends.
And suppose I have kept a few more expensive gifts aside for  Leave, Seleucus.
You should also know that as head of state, we are often blamed for the crimes of others.
And though we may fall, we are still responsible for their offenses.
I am therefore to be pitied.
