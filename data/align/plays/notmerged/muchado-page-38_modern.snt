Wasn’t Don John at dinner tonight?
I didn’t see him.
That man always looks so sour!
Just looking at him gives me heartburn.
He has a very gloomy attitude.
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick.
One of them is too much like a painting of a man—he never speaks—and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy, always chattering.
So, the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John— And if he were handsome, agile, and rich, too, he could have any woman in the world—all he’d need was her good will.
Really, niece, you’ll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people.
Honestly, she is too ill-tempered.
