I’ll think it over.
Tomorrow, I’ll let you know what I’ve decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England.
Regarding the Dauphin, you can speak to me.
What’s the message from the English king?
Scorn and defiance, indifference, contempt, and any insult that wouldn’t disgrace the mighty sender—that’s the value he puts on you.
And my king goes on: if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands, Henry’s artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face.
Say this: if my father sends a friendly answer, it is against my will.
I want nothing but conflict with England.
To that end, I presented him with the tennis balls, the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity.
He’ll make your palace tremble for this insult, even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe.
And, make no mistake, you’ll find, as we his subjects have, an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now.
Now he uses his time wisely, as you will see by your own casualties, if he remains in France.
We’ll give you an answer tomorrow.
