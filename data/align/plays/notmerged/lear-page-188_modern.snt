Prepare the horses for your lady.
Goodbye, my sweet lord.—Goodbye, my sister.
Goodbye, Edmund.
Go find the traitor Gloucester.
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me.
I can’t condemn him to death without a formal trial, but I’m powerful enough that I can still do  Ungrateful traitor!
That’s him.
Tie up his withered old arms.
What are you doing?
My friends, remember that you’re my guests here.
Don’t play any nasty tricks on me.
Tie him up, I tell you.
