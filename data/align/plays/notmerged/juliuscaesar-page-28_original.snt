But soft, I pray you.
What, did Caesar swoon?
He fell down in the marketplace, and foamed at mouth, and was speechless.
Tis very like.
He hath the falling sickness.
No, Caesar hath it not.
But you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down.
If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man.
What said he when he came unto himself?
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut.
An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues.
And so he fell.
When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.
Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts.
But there’s no heed to be taken of them.
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less.
And after that he came thus sad away?
Ay.
