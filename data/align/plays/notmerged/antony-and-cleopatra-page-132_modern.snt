This toast is for Lepidus!
Here’s to you, Menas.
I accept with thanks, Enobarbus.
Fill the cups until they run over.
There goes a strong fellow, Menas.
Why do you say that?
He carries a third of the world.
Can’t you see that?
Then a third of the world is drunk.
I wish it were all drunk.
Then everything would go more smoothly.
Drink up.
Liven up the party.
All right, then.
This hasn’t reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet.
It’s getting there.
Clink your cups together in a toast!
Here’s to Caesar.
I could do without another toast.
It’s unnatural.
I keep washing my brain with alcohol, and it keeps getting fouler and more muddled.
Live in the moment.
I’d prefer to seize the day.
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one.
