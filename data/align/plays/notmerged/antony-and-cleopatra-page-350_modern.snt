Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago.
She stood and spoke.
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress.
She stood trembling, then suddenly dropped dead.
Oh, noble weakness!
If they had swallowed poison, it would be evident by external swelling.
But she looks like she’s asleep, as if she would charm another Antony.
Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark.
There’s a similar mark on her arm.
