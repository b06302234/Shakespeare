Now, sir, what make you here?
Nothing.
I am not taught to make anything.
What mar you then, sir?
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
Know you where you are, sir?
O sir, very well: here in your orchard.
Know you before whom, sir?
Ay, better than him I am before knows me.
I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me.
The courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that you are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us.
I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit, I confess, your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.
