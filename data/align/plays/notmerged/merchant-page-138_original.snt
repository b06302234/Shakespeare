When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, That he would rather have Antonioâ€™s flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him.

The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, The best conditioned and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies, and one in whom The ancient Roman honor more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy.
What sum owes he the Jew?
For me, three thousand ducats.
