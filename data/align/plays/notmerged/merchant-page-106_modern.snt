So, what’s the news on the Rialto?
Well, there’s a rumor that Antonio had a ship carrying expensive cargo that shipwrecked in the English Channel on the Goodwin Sands, a very dangerous sandbar.
Many ships have sunk there, according to rumors.
I hope this new rumor is a lie, like the gossiping widow’s claim that she was sorry her third husband died!
But it’s true—I don’t want to get all mushy and go on and on, but the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—oh, if I only had a title good enough to match his!— Come on, get to the point.
What are you saying?
Well, the point is, he’s lost a ship.
I hope that’s all he loses.
Let me say “amen” quickly, before the devil comes in and stops my prayer—because here comes the devil, disguised as a Jew.
