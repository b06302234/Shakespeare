Do not torment me.
Oh!
What’s the matter?
Have we devils here?
Do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind, ha?
I have not ’scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs.
Or it hath been said, “As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground,” and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at' nostrils.
The spirit torments me.
Oh!
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got, as I take it, an ague.
Where the devil should he learn our language?
I will give him some relief if it be but for that.
If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s leather.
Do not torment me, prithee.
I’ll bring my wood home faster.
He’s in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest.
He shall taste of my bottle.
If he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit.
If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him.
He shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly.
