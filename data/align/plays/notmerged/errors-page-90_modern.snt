Master, there’s a ship from Epidamnum that’s going to set sail as soon as its owner gets on board.
I’ve left our luggage on the ship, and I bought the oil, balm, and liquor you wanted.
The ship is ready, the wind is up, and the sailors are only waiting for their owner and for you.
What are you, a madman?
You annoying idiot, what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me?
A ship you sent me to find, to book passage out of here.
You drunken slave, I sent you for a rope, and I told you what to do with it.
Yeah, right—you sent me to get whipped.
You sent me to the port to find a ship.
I’ll debate this with you later, and then I’ll teach you to listen more carefully.
Go to Adriana, you scoundrel, and quickly.
Give her this key, and tell her that there’s money in the desk that’s covered with a Turkish tapestry.
Have her send it to me.
Tell her that I’ve been arrested and the money will be my bail.
Hurry, you slave!
Go!
Officer, take me to prison until the money comes.
