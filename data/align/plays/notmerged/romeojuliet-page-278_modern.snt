What’s this awful thing that everyone’s crying about?
Prince, here lies Count Paris killed.
And Romeo dead.
And Juliet.
She was dead before, but now she’s warm and hasn’t been dead for long.
Investigate how this foul murder came about.
Here is a friar, and dead Romeo’s man.
They’ve got tools on them—tools they could use to open these tombs.
Oh heavens!
Oh wife, look at how our daughter bleeds!
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague’s back, but instead it’s mis-sheathed in my daughter’s breast.
Oh my!
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I’m old and I’ll die soon.
Come, Montague.
You’re up early to see your son down early.
Oh, my liege, my wife died tonight.
Sadness over my son’s exile stopped her breath.
What further pain must I endure in my old age?
Look, and you’ll see.
