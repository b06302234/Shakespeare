In Alexandria he condemned Rome, and that’s not all.
This is what happened: he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace.
He did this in public?
In the public arena, where they perform sporting events.
He proclaimed his sons to be kings of kings.
He gave Media, Parthia, and Armenia to Alexander.
He gave Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia to Ptolemy.
Cleopatra was dressed like the goddess Isis.
They say she often attended her public functions like that.
Let’s send this news to Rome.
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already.
They’ll abandon him completely when they hear this.
