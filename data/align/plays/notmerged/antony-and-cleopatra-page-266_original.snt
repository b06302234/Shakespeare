If we be not relieved within this hour, We must return to th’ court of guard.
The night Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle By th’ second hour i’ th’ morn.
This last day was a shrewd one to ’s.
O bear me witness, night— What man is this?
Stand close and list him.
Be witness to me, O thou blessèd moon, When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent.
Enobarbus?
Peace!
Hark further.
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy, The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me, That life, a very rebel to my will, May hang no longer on me.
Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault, Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder And finish all foul thoughts.
O Antony, Nobler than my revolt is infamous, Forgive me in thine own particular, But let the world rank me in register A master-leaver and a fugitive.
O Antony!
O Antony!
