Is there no pity in the sky that can see my sadness?
Oh, my sweet mother, don’t throw me out!
Delay this marriage for a month, or a week.
Or, if you don’t delay, make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies.
Don’t talk to me, because I won’t say a word.
Do as you please, because I’m done worrying about you.
Oh God!—Oh Nurse, how can this be stopped?
My husband is alive on earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven.
How can I bring those promises back down to earth, unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven?
Give me comfort.
Give me advice.
Oh no!
Oh no!
Why does heaven play tricks on someone as weak as me?
What do you say?
Don’t you have one word of joy?
Give me some comfort, Nurse.
