Look, she’s come home from confession with a happy look on her face.
So, my headstrong daughter, where have you been?
I went somewhere where I learned that being disobedient to my father is a sin.
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness.
Send for the Count.
Go tell him about this.
I’ll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning.
I met the young man at Lawrence’s cell.
I treated him with the proper love, as well as I could, while still being modest.
Well, I’m glad about this.
This is good.
Stand up.
This is the way it should be.
I want to see the count.
Yes, alright, go, I say, and bring him here.
Now, before God, our whole city owes this friar a great debt.
Nurse, will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I’ll need to wear tomorrow?
