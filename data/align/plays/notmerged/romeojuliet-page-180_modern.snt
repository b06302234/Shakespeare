Now get out of here.
Good night.
Everything depends on this: either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions, or leave in disguise after daybreak.
Take a little vacation in Mantua.
I’ll find your servant, and he’ll update you now and then on your case as it stands here.
Give me your hand.
It’s late.
Farewell.
Good night.
I’m off to experience the greatest joy of all, but still it’s sad to leave you in such a rush.
Farewell.
