We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition; For we have now no thought in us but France, Save those to God, that run before our business.
Therefore let our proportions for these wars Be soon collected, and all things thought upon That may with reasonable swiftness add More feathers to our wings.
For, God before, We’ll chide this Dauphin at his father’s door.
Therefore let every man now task his thought, That this fair action may on foot be brought.
