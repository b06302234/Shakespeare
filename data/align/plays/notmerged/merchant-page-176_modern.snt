Antonio and Shylock, both of you come forward.
Is your name Shylock?
Shylock is my name.
Your case is most unusual, though the Venetian law can’t stop you from proceeding.— Yes, so he says.
Do you acknowledge the contract?
Yes, I do.
Then the Jew must show you mercy.
Why do I have to do that?
Tell me.
No one shows mercy because he has to.
It just happens, the way gentle rain drops on the ground.
Mercy is a double blessing.
It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it.
It’s strongest in the strongest people.
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him.
The king’s scepter represents his earthly power, the symbol of majesty, the focus of royal authority.
But mercy is higher than the scepter.
It’s enthroned in the hearts of kings, a quality of God himself.
Kingly power seems most like God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice.
So although justice is your plea, Jew, consider this.
