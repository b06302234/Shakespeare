The sunset was golden and left a bright track in the sky, which indicates that tomorrow will be a good day.
Sir William Brandon, you will carry my flag.
Bring some ink and paper to my tent, and I’ll draw a model of our battle, appoint each leader to his particular command, and carefully divide up our small army.
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon, and you, Sir Walter Herbert, are going to stay with me.
The earl of Pembroke will stick with his regiment.
Good Captain Blunt, tell the earl goodnight from me, and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent.
One more thing before you go, Blunt—where is Lord Stanley lodging, do you know?
Unless I’ve mistaken his battle flags, which I’m sure I haven’t, his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king’s mighty army.
If it’s possible to do this without putting yourself in danger, dear Captain Blunt, say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note.
Upon my life, my lord, I’ll do it.
Have a restful night!
