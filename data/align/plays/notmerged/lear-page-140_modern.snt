Where’s he going?
He has called for his horse, but I don’t know where he’s headed.
It’s best just to let him go.
He won’t listen to anyone’s advice.
Ah, but it’s getting dark, and the winds are strong and stormy.
There’s hardly a bush for miles around.
He’ll have no shelter.
Oh, sir, impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions.
Lock the doors.
His attendants are desperate, violent men.
I’m afraid of what they might encourage him to do, considering the state he’s in.
Lock the doors, my lord.
It’s a wild night.
Regan gives good advice.
Come in out of the storm.
