Why, sir, he’s not coming.
Didn’t you just say he was?
Who?
Petruchio?
Yes, Petruchio.
No, I said his horse is coming, with him on its back.
Well, that’s the same thing.
No, by Saint Jamy, I’ll bet you a penny!
A man and his horse Aren’t the same person— Not that there’s much difference.
Whoa!
Where is everybody?
You are welcome, sir.
I don’t  I don’t notice you limping.
