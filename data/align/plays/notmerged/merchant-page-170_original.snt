Upon my power I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learn√®d doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Come here today.
My lord, here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor, New come from Padua.
Bring us the letter.
Call the messenger.
Good cheer, Antonio!
What, man, courage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all, Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
I am a tainted wether of the flock, Meetest for death.
The weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.
You cannot better be employed, Bassanio, Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
From both, my lord.
Bellario greets your grace.
