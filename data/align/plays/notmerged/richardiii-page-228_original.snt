Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee.
Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee.
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me.
Eighty-odd years of sorrow have I seen, And each hour’s joy wracked with a week of teen.
Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.— Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes Whom envy hath immured within your walls— Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow For tender princes, use my babies well.
So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.
