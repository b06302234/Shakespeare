Boy, I beg you to run to the senate house.
Don’t stay to answer me—get going.
Why are you still standing there?
To find out what you want me to do there, madam.
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there.
Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol and nothing else?
And then return to you and nothing else?
Yes, return and tell me if your master looks well, because he was sick when he left.
And pay attention to what Caesar does and which men are close to him.
Listen, boy!
What’s that noise?
I don’t hear anything, madam.
I beg you, listen well.
I heard a noise like a scuffle.
The wind brings it from the Capitol.
Truly, madam, I don’t hear anything.
