Be quiet, people!
Why have you come here in such a mob?
To get my poor, mad husband out from inside there.
Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover.
How long has he been possessed like this?
This week he was sad, moody, and depressed and very different from his usual self.
But it wasn’t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence.
Did he lose a lot of money in a shipwreck?
Has a close friend of his died?
Has he fallen in love with another woman?
That’s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander.
Which of these bad things happened to him?
None of them, except the last one.
He fell in love, and that made him leave home often.
You should have reprimanded him for that.
I did.
Fine, but you weren’t harsh enough.
