That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
We are two lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible.
And Caesar shall go forth.
Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth today.
Call it my fear That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house, And he shall say you are not well today.
Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor I will stay at home.
Here’s Decius Brutus.
He shall tell them so.
Caesar, all hail!
Good morrow, worthy Caesar.
I come to fetch you to the senate house.
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today.
Cannot” is false, and that I dare not, falser.
I will not come today.
Tell them so, Decius.
Say he is sick.
Shall Caesar send a lie?
Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
