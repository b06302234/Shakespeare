Your  It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, would she say?
O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings.
Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a countryâ€™s fashion.
We are the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find- faults, as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss.
Therefore, patiently and yielding.
God save your Majesty.
My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.
Is she not apt?
Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness.
