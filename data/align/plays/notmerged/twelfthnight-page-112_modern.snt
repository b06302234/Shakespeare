for you.
Argue with a relative like a nobleman, and be rude to servants.
Talk about politics and affairs of state, and act free and independent.
The woman who advises you to do this loves you.
Remember the woman who complimented you on your yellow stockings, and said she always wanted to see you with crisscrossing laces going up your legs—remember her.
Go ahead.
A happy new life is there if you want it.
If you don’t want it, just keep acting like a lowly servant who’s not brave enough to grab the happiness there before him.
Goodbye.
Signed, she who would be your servant,     The Fortunate Unhappy.” This is as clear as sunlight in an open field.
I’ll do it.
I’ll be vain and proud, I’ll read up on politics, I’ll insult Sir Toby, I’ll get rid of my lower-class friends, and I’ll be the perfect man for her.
I know I’m not fooling myself, or letting myself get carried away by my imagination, because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me.
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently, and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs.
That’s her way of saying she loves me.
Oh, I thank my lucky stars, I’m so happy.
For her I’ll be strange and condescending, and I’ll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away.
Thank God and my horoscope!
Here’s a postscript!.
You must have figured out who I am.
If you love me, let me know by smiling at me.
You’re so attractive when you smile.
Please smile whenever you’re near me, my dearest darling.”
