Not me.
Please, come.
I don’t like sports.
I’m not competitive like Antony.
But don’t let me keep you from going, Cassius.
I’ll go my own way.
Brutus, I’ve been watching you lately.
You seem less good-natured and affectionate toward me than usual.
You’ve been stubborn and unfamiliar with me, your friend who loves you.
Cassius, don’t take it badly.
If I seem guarded, it’s only because I’m uneasy with  Brutus, I misunderstood your feelings, and therefore kept to myself certain thoughts I might have shared.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
No, Cassius.
The eye can’t see itself, except by reflection in other surfaces.
