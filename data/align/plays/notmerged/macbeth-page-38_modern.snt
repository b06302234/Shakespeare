Where is Macbeth, the thane of Cawdor?
We followed closely after him.
I hoped to arrive here before him, but he rides swiftly.
And his great love, which is as sharp as his spur, helped him beat us here.
Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight.
We are your servants, your highness, and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal, for after all, we keep it in your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s yours.
Give me your hand.
Bring me to my host, Macbeth.
I love him dearly, and I shall continue to favor him.
Whenever you’re ready, hostess.
