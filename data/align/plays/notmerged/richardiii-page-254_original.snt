Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him Then forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death— That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes, To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood; That excellent grand tyrant of the earth, That reigns in gallèd eyes of weeping souls; That foul defacer of God’s handiwork Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.
O upright, just, and true-disposing God, How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother’s body And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
O Harry’s wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
Bear with me, I am hungry for revenge, And now I cloy me with beholding it.
Thy Edward he is dead, that killed my Edward, Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; Young York, he is but boot, because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss.
Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward, And the beholders of this frantic play, Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, Untimely smothered in their dusky graves.
Richard yet lives, hell’s black intelligencer, Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither.
But at hand, at hand Ensues his piteous and unpitied end.
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray, To have him suddenly conveyed from hence.
Cancel his bond of life, dear God I pray, That I may live to say, “The dog is dead.”
