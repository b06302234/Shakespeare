So Benedick should conceal his emotions.
Like a fire that gets covered up, Benedick should smother his love and waste away.
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked, which is as bad as being killed by tickling.
But you should tell her about this, and hear what she has to say.
No, instead I’ll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions.
I’ll make up some awful things about my cousin and ruin her reputation.
You don’t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word.
Oh, don’t injure your cousin like that!
With the quick, intelligent wit she’s rumored to have, she can’t really be such a bad judge of character that she’d refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick.
He’s the only worthy man in Italy, aside from my dear Claudio.
Don’t be angry with me for speaking my mind, but throughout Italy, Benedick is considered the best man in looks, bearing, intelligence, and bravery.
True, he has an excellent reputation.
And he deserves it, having been excellent before he had a reputation for it.
When are you getting married, madam?
