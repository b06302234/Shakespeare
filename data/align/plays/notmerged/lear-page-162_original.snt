Away!
The foul fiend follows me!
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
Hum!
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.
Didst thou give all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this?
Who gives any thing to Poor Tom, whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlipool, o'er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting- horse over four-inched bridges to course his own shadow for a traitor?
Bless thy five wits.
Tom’s a-cold.
Oh, do-de, do-de, do-de.
Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking!
Do Poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes.
There could I have him now—and there—and there again—and there.
What, has his daughters brought him to this pass?— Couldst thou save nothing?
Wouldst thou give 'em all?
Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o'er men’s faults light on thy daughters!
He hath no daughters, sir.
