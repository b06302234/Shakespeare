I swear I am.
Get me some ink, paper, and a candle.
I’ll write a letter and you’ll take it to my lady.
You’ll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before.
I’ll help you.
But tell me honestly, are you sure you’re not insane?
Or are you just pretending?
Believe me, I’m not.
I’m telling the truth.
I’ll never believe a madman until I can see his brains.
But I’ll get you a candle and paper and ink.
Fool, I’ll repay you for this favor.
Please, hurry.
