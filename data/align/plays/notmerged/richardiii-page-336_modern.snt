What does Lord Stanley say?
Will he bring his army?
My lord, he refuses to come.
Off with his son George’s head!
My lord, the enemy has already passed the marsh.
Let George Stanley die after the battle.
A thousand hearts beat in my chest.
Let’s advance our flags, set upon our enemies, and have our ancient saint of courage, good Saint George, inspire us with the fury of fiery dragons!
Let’s go!
Victory is with us.
