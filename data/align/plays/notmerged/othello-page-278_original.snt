Alas, he is betrayed and I undone.
Out, strumpet!
weep’st thou for him to my face?
Oh, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
Down, strumpet!
Kill me tomorrow—let me live tonight!
Nay, if you strive— But half an hour!
Being done, there is no pause.
But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
What noise is this?—Not dead?
Not yet quite dead?
I that am cruel am yet merciful, I would not have thee linger in thy pain.
So, so.
Who’s there?
