No, don’t press up against me.
Stand further away.
Stand back.
Give him room.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all know this cloak.
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on.
It was a summer’s evening; he was in his tent.
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors.
Look, here’s where Cassius’s dagger pierced it.
See the wound that Casca made.
Through this hole beloved Brutus stabbed.
And when he pulled out his cursed dagger, see how Caesar’s blood came with it, as if rushing out a door to see if it was really Brutus who was knocking so rudely.
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.
The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkind cut of all.
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, he understood his beloved Brutus’s ingratitude; it was stronger than the violence of traitors, and it defeated him, bursting his mighty heart.
And at the base of Pompey’s statue, with his cloak covering his face, which was dripping with blood the whole time, great Caesar fell.
Oh, what a fall it was, my countrymen!
Then you and I and all of us fell down, while bloody treason triumphed.
Oh, now you weep, and I sense that you feel pity.
These are gracious tears.
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar’s wounded cloak, how will you feel, kind men, now?
Look at this, here is the man—scarred, as you can see, by traitors.
