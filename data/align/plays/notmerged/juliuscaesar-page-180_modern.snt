Oh Cassius, I’m tired out by many sorrows.
You’re forgetting your  No one bears sorrow better than me.
Portia is dead.
Portia!
She is dead.
How did you manage not to kill me when we argued just now?
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss!
What sickness did she die of?
She was worried about my absence, and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong—which I found out at the same time as the news of her death.
She became full of despair and, when her attendants were away, swallowed burning coals.
And that’s how she died?
Yes, like that.
Oh, immortal gods!
