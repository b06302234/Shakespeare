Oh, you’re just going to talk about banishment again.
I’ll give you protection from that word.
I’ll give you the antidote for trouble: philosophy.
Philosophy will comfort you even though you’ve been banished.
You’re still talking about “banished?” Forget about philosophy!
Unless philosophy can create a Juliet, or pick up a town and put it somewhere else, or reverse a prince’s punishment, it doesn’t do me any good.
Don’t say anything else.
Oh, so madmen like you are also deaf.
How should madmen hear, if wise men can’t even see?
Let me talk to you about your situation.
You can’t talk about something that you don’t feel.
If you were as young as I am, if you were in love with Juliet, if you had just married her an hour ago, if then you murdered Tybalt, if you were lovesick like me, and if you were banished, then you might talk about it.
You might also tear your hair out of your head and collapse to the ground the way I do right now.
Get up.
Somebody’s knocking.
Hide yourself, good Romeo.
