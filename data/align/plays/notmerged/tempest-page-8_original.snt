What, must our mouths be cold?
The king and prince at prayers.
Let’s assist them, for our case is as theirs.
I’m out of patience.
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.
This wide-chopped rascal—would thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides!
He’ll be hanged yet, though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him.
Let’s all sink wi' th' king.
Let’s take leave of him.
