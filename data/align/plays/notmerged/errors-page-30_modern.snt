The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur, and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me.
I haven’t spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier.
Here he comes.
So, sir.
Are you over your ridiculous mood?
If you like being hit, crack some more jokes.
You never heard of the Centaur?
You weren’t given any gold?
Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner?
The Phoenix is my house?
Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly?
Said what, sir?
When did I say all that?
Just now.
Right here.
Less than half an hour ago.
I haven’t seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
You moron, you denied having any gold, and you told me about a mistress and a lunch.
And I hope you realized I wasn’t very happy about it.
I’m glad to see you in such a merry mood.
But what’s the joke?
Please, master, tell me.
