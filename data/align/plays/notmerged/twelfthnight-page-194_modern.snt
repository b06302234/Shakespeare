The fool’s a good actor.
A good fool.
I’m Sir Topas the priest.
I’ve come to visit Malvolio the lunatic.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, please go find my lady Olivia— Get out, demon!
Why are you bothering this poor man!
Can’t you talk about anything besides ladies?
Sir Topas, nobody’s ever been as badly treated as I’ve been.
Good Sir Topas, don’t believe I’m insane, They’ve shut me up here in horrible darkness.
You should be ashamed of yourself, Satan, you liar!
I’m being gentle with you, because I’m one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself.
You call this house dark?
Dark as hell, Sir Topas.
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls, and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal.
But you’re still complaining of darkness and a bad view?
I’m not insane, Sir Topas.
I’m telling you, this house is dark.
