You’ve owed me this money since the Pentecost holiday.
I haven’t pressed you for it, and I wouldn’t now except that I’m going to Persia and I need money for the trip.
So pay me now, or I’ll have this officer arrest you.
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you.
Just before I ran into you, I gave him a necklace.
At five o'clock he’s going to pay me for it.
Please, come to his house with me.
I’ll pay what I owe you then and say thank you as well.
He saves you the trouble: look, here he comes.
