I can’t promise that love won’t transform me, but I can promise you this: until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool.
A beautiful woman comes along, but I’m unmoved.
A wise woman turns up, but I’m unmoved.
A virtuous woman appears, but I’m unmoved.
I refuse to fall in love until all three qualities unite in a single woman.
She must be rich, certainly, and smart, or I’ll have nothing to do with her.
She has to be virtuous, or I’ll never bid on her; beautiful, or I won’t bother to look at her.
Mild-mannered, or else she should stay away from me.
Noble, or I won’t have her even if she’s an angel.
She must be well spoken, an excellent musician, and her hair should be—well, I suppose the color doesn’t matter.
Ha!
Look, it’s the Prince and Mr. Love.
I’ll hide in the arbor.
Well, should we hear some music?
Yes, my lord.
Listen to how quiet the evening is, as if it’s purposefully setting the stage for a song.
Come on, Balthasar, let’s hear that song again.
