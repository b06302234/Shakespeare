No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born.—Cousins, God give you joy!
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
I cry you mercy, uncle.—By your Grace’s pardon.
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
There’s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord.
She is never sad but when she sleeps, and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
Oh, by no means.
She mocks all her wooers out of suit.
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
Tomorrow, my lord.
Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.
