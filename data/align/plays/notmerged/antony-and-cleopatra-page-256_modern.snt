Retreat!
We’ve advanced too far.
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected.
Oh, my brave Emperor, this is what I call a fight!
If we’d fought like this before, we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads.
You’re bleeding a lot.
I had a scar here that looked like a “T”; now it’s an “H.” They’re retreating.
We’ll chase ’em into their latrines.
I still have room for six more wounds.
They’re retreating, sir, and our superiority indicates a clear victory.
Let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits, from behind.
It’s fair game to mark a coward.
I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage.
Come on.
