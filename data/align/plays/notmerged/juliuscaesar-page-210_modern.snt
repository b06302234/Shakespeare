By the same principle that made me condemn Cato for committing suicide, I plan to be patient and submit to what the gods decide.
I don’t know why, but I find it cowardly and vile to kill oneself early to prevent possible suffering later on.
Then if we lose this battle, you’ll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome?
No, Cassius, no.
Don’t imagine that I’ll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains.
My mind is too great for that.
But today, the work that March 15th began must end, and I don’t know if we’ll meet again.
Therefore, accept my everlasting farewell.
Forever and forever, farewell, Cassius!
If we meet again, then we’ll smile.
If not, then this parting was well done.
Forever and forever, farewell, Brutus!
If we meet again, then we’ll smile indeed.
If not, it’s true, this parting was well done.
Well, lead on.
Oh, I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens!
But it’s enough to know that the day will end, and then the end will be known.
Come!
Let’s go!
