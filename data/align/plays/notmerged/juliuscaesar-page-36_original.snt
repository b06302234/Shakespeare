And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noon-day upon the marketplace, Hooting and shrieking.
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet, let not men say, “These are their reasons.
They are natural.” For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon.

Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
He doth, for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
Good night then, Casca.
This disturbèd sky Is not to walk in.
Farewell, Cicero.
Who’s there?
A Roman.
Casca, by your voice.
Your ear is good.
Cassius, what night is this!
A very pleasing night to honest men.
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
