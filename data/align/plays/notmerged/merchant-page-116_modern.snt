But Antonio’s certainly ruined.
That’s true, that’s very true.
Tubal, go find me a police officer to arrest Antonio.
Get him ready two weeks ahead of time.—I’ll take Antonio’s heart if he can’t pay.
With him out of Venice, I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money.—Go, Tubal.
Meet me at the synagogue.
