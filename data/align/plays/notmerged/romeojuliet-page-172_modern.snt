I won’t hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people’s searching eyes.
Listen, they’re still knocking!— Run and hide in my study.—Just a minute—For the love of God, why are you being so stupid?
I’m coming.
I’m coming.
Why are you knocking so hard?
Where do you come from?
What do you want?
Oh, holy Friar, Oh, tell me, holy Friar, where is my lady’s husband?
Where’s Romeo?
