Oh, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, Environèd with all these hideous fears, And madly play with my forefather’s joints, And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud, And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone, As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
Oh, look!
Methinks I see my cousin’s ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body Upon a rapier’s point.
Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo!
Here’s drink.
I drink to thee.
