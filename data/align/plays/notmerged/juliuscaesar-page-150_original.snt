I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar, And things unlucky charge my fantasy.
I have no will to wander forth of doors, Yet something leads me forth.
What is your name?
Whither are you going?
Where do you dwell?
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Answer every man directly.
Ay, and briefly.
Ay, and wisely.
Ay, and truly, you were best.
What is my name?
Whither am I going?
Where do I dwell?
Am I a married man or a bachelor?
Then, to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly—wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry.
You’ll bear me a bang for that, I fear.
Proceed, directly.
Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.
