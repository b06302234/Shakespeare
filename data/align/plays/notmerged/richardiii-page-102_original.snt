Madam, yourself is not exempt in this,— Nor you, son Dorset, —Buckingham, nor you.
You have been factious one against the other.— Wife, love Lord Hastings.
Let him kiss your hand, And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
There, Hastings, I will never more remember Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine.
Dorset, embrace him.—Hastings, love Lord Marquess.
This interchange of love, I here protest, Upon my part shall be inviolable.
And so swear I.
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league With thy embracements to my wife’s allies And make me happy in your unity.
