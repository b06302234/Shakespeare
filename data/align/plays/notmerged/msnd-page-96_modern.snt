Hermia’s love, and now you’re competing to see which one of you can make fun of me the most.
That’s a great idea, a really manly thing to do—making a poor girl cry!
No respectable person would offend an innocent girl just to have some fun.
Don’t be cruel, Demetrius.
I know you love Hermia, and you know I know it.
Right here, right now, I swear I’m giving up all my claims on her and handing her to you.
In exchange, give up your claim to love Helena, since I love her and will love her until I die.
Nobody’s ever gone to so much trouble just to make fun of someone.
Lysander, keep your Hermia.
I don’t want her.
If I ever loved her, all that love is gone now.
My love for her was temporary.
Now I’ll love Helena forever.
Helena, it’s not true.
Don’t insult a deep love that you don’t understand, or you’ll pay the price.
Look, here comes the woman you love.
It’s hard to see clearly in the dark of night, but it’s easier to hear well.
