That was one hit.
No, it wasn’t.
Referee!
It was obviously a hit.
Well, let’s go on.
Give me a goblet.—Hamlet, this pearl’s yours.
Here’s to your health.
Give him the goblet.
Let me just finish this round.
Set it down awhile.
Let’s play.
Another hit.
What do you say?
You got me, I admit it.
My son will win.
He’s flabby and out of breath.—Here, Hamlet, take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead.
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness, Hamlet.
