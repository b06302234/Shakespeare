Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled.
No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head.
Oh, horrible, oh, horrible, most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damnèd incest.
But howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught.
Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her.
Fare thee well at once.
The glowworm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
Adieu, adieu, adieu.
Remember me.
O all you host of heaven!
O earth!
What else?
And shall I couple hell?
Oh, fie!
Hold, hold, my heart, And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up.
Remember thee!
Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat In this distracted globe.
Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmixed with baser matter.
Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damnèd villain!
My tables!—Meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.
At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark.
So, uncle, there you are.
Now to my word.
