Thank you, madam.
Gertrude, don’t drink that.
Excuse me.
I’ll drink it if I like.
I’d better not drink now.
I’ll drink later.
Come on, let me wipe your face.
I doubt it.
Get ready for the third hit, Laertes.
You’re just playing around.
Come on, give me your best shot.
I sense you’re treating me like a child.
You think so?
Come on.
They’re neck and neck.
Take this!
Separate them.
They’re overdoing it.
