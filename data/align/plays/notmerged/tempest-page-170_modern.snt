Fury, Fury!—Get over there, Tyrant, there.
Listen, listen!
Ariel, go order my goblin servants to make these fellows' bones ache, give them muscle cramps all over, and give them more bruises than leopards have spots.
Listen they’re howling.
Hunt them down.
Now all my enemies are at my mercy.
Soon all my work will be done, and you’ll be free.
Just obey me a little bit longer.
