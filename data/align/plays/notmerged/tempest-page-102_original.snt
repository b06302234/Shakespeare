Thou art very Trinculo indeed!
How camest thou to be the siege of this mooncalf?
Can he vent Trinculos?
I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke.
But art thou not drowned, Stephano?
I hope now thou art not drowned.
Is the storm overblown?
I hid me under the dead mooncalf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm.
And art thou living, Stephano?
O Stephano, two Neapolitans ’scaped!
Prithee, do not turn me about.
My stomach is not constant.
Swum ashore, man, like a duck.
I can swim like a duck, I’ll be sworn.
Here, kiss the book.
Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose.
