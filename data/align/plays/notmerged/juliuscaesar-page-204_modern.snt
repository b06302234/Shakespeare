I took their stings too, wouldn’t you say?
Oh, yes, and you’ve left them silent too, because you stole their buzzing, Antony.
You very wisely warn us before you sting.
Villains, you didn’t do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar’s sides.
You smiled like apes and fawned like dogs and bowed like servants, kissing Caesar’s feet.
And all the while, damned Casca, like a dog, struck Caesar on the neck from behind.
Oh, you flatterers!
Flatterers!
Now, Brutus, you have only yourself to thank.
Antony wouldn’t be here to offend us today if you’d listened to me earlier.
Come, come, let’s remember why we’re here.
If arguing makes us sweat, the real trial will turn that water to blood.
Caesar, you’re not going to be killed by a traitor—unless you kill yourself..
I hope you’re right.
I wasn’t born to die on your sword.
If you were the noblest of your family, young man, you couldn’t die more honorably.
