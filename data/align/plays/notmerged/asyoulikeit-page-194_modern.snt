West of here, in the valley next to us.
Passing by on your right, there is a row of willows.
Follow them straight to the cottage.
But right now, the house is keeping to itself— there’s no one home.
I think I recognize you from a description I was given of your clothing and age: “The boy is pretty and feminine, and carries himself like a blooming young woman.
The woman is short, with a darker complexion than her brother.” Aren’t you the owners of the house I was just asking about?
Since you asked, I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are.
Orlando sends his regards to you both, and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind.” Is that you?
It is.
What does this mean?
It’s a story that involves some shame on my part.
It’s about who I am, and how, why, and where this handkerchief was stained.
Please, tell us.
