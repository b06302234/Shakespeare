sheep nibble, the furrows that April covers with flowers for nymphs to make crowns with.
You must leave the groves where the disappointed bachelor lurks, rejected by his love, and the well-pruned vineyards, and the rocky seashore.
You must leave these places and hurry here to this grassy spot, to entertain Juno.
Greetings to you, rainbow messenger, who never disobeys Juno, wife of Jupiter; with your golden wings you sprinkle dewdrops and refreshing showers on my flowers, and arch your colored bow over my wooded fields and grassy meadows, like a beautiful scarf to decorate my earth.
Why has your queen, Juno, called me here to this grassy spot?
To celebrate a marriage of true love, and give a gift to the lovers.
Tell me, rainbow, do you know if either Venus, the goddess of love, or her son, Cupid, is accompanying Queen Juno?
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year, I swore Iâ€™d never speak to them again.
