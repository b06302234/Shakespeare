If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I’d have thee beaten for being old before thy time.
How’s that?
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.
O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!
I would not be mad.
Keep me in temper.
I would not be mad.
How now?
Are the horses ready?
Ready, my lord.
Come, boy.
She that’s a maid now and laughs at my departure, Shall not be a maid long unless things be cut shorter.
