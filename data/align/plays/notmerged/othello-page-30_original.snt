When we consider Th' importancy of Cyprus to the Turk, And let ourselves again but understand That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes So may he with more facile question bear it, For that it stands not in such warlike brace But altogether lacks th' abilities That Rhodes is dressed in.
If we make thought of this We must not think the Turk is so unskillful To leave that latest which concerns him first, Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain To wake and wage a danger profitless.
Nay, in all confidence, heâ€™s not for Rhodes.
Here is more news.
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious, Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes, Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
Ay, so I thought.
How many, as you guess?
Of thirty sail.
And now they do re-stem Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus.
Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, And prays you to believe him.
