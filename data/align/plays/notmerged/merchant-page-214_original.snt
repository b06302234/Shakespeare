That is the voice, Or I am much deceived, of Portia.
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo— By the bad voice.
Dear lady, welcome home.
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare, Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
Are they returned?
Madam, they are not yet, But there is come a messenger before To signify their coming.
Go in, Nerissa.
Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence.— Nor you, Lorenzo.—Jessica, nor you.
