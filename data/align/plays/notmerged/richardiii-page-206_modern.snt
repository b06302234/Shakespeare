Ah, my lord, this prince is nothing like Edward!
He is not lolling in bed but on his knees in prayer.
He’s not enjoying himself with a couple of prostitutes but studying with two learned priests.
He’s not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body, but praying, to nourish his attentive soul.
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king.
But I’m afraid we’ll never get him to agree to be king.
But God forbid he says no to us!
I’m afraid he will.
Here comes Catesby again.
What’s up, Catesby, what does your master say?
My lord, he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him, since he had no idea they were coming.
My lord, he’s afraid you mean him harm.
I’m sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me.
By God, I’m here because I love him.
Return and tell him so.
When devoutly religious men are praying, it’s hard to draw them out of it, because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation.
