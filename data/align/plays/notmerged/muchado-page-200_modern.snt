Benedick, Beatrice praised your wit the other day.
I said you had a fine wit.
True,” she said, “a fine little one.” “No,” I said, “a huge wit.” “Right,” she said, “a hugely awful one.” “No,” I said, “he has a good wit.” “Exactly,” she said, “it’s good and mild; it doesn’t hurt anyone.” “No,” I said, “Benedick is wise.” “He is certainly,” she said,  She cried a lot at that, and said she didn’t care.
That she did.
And yet for all that, if she didn’t hate him to death, she’d love him to death.
Leonato’s daughter had told us everything.
Absolutely everything.
And, moreover, God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden.
But when exactly will we see Benedick married?
Yes, with the sign underneath him that says: “Here lives Benedick the married man”?
Goodbye, boy.
You know what I intend.
I’ll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman.
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword—it can’t hurt anyone, thank God.—My lord, I thank you for your many kindnesses.
I’m leaving your court now.
