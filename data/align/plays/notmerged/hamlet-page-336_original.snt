Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
But let this same be presently performed, Even while menâ€™s minds are wild, lest more mischance On plots and errors happen.
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage, For he was likely, had he been put on, To have proved most royally.
And, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies.
Such a sight as this Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
