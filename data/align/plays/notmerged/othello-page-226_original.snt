The fixèd figure for the time of scorn To point his slow and moving finger at!
Yet could I bear that too, well, very well.
But there where I have garnered up my heart, Where either I must live or bear no life, The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up—to be discarded thence!
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in!
Turn thy complexion there, Patience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin,— Ay, there, look grim as hell!
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
Oh, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles, That quicken even with blowing.
O thou weed, Who art so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, Made to write “whore” upon?
What committed?
Committed?
O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks That would to cinders burn up modesty Did I but speak thy deeds.
What committed?
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks, The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets Is hushed within the hollow mine of earth And will not hear ’t.
What committed!
Impudent strumpet!
By heaven, you do me wrong!
