Richard Earl of Cambridge, I arrest you for high treason.
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, I arrest you for high treason.
Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland, I arrest you for high treason.
A just God has discovered our plot.
I regret my crime more than my death, and I beg your Highness to forgive me, while punishing my body with death.
For my part, I didnâ€™t do it for the money, though I admit the money encouraged me to do what I was planning sooner.
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme, and I rejoice in paying the penalty, as I beg God and you to pardon me.
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking.
Pardon my crime, sovereign, but not my person.
May God in His mercy forgive you.
This is your sentence.
You have conspired against us with a proclaimed enemy and accepted his money in exchange for killing us.
In doing so, you would have sold your king to slaughter, his princes and lords to slavery, his subjects to oppression and abuse, and his whole kingdom to ruin.
I seek no revenge for myself, but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom, which you sought to destroy, that you must be punished according to her laws.
So go to your deaths, poor miserable wretches, the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure.
And may you truly regret your terrible crimes.
Take them away.
