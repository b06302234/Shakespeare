Oh, a thousand times worse, a thousand times—and what a sweet personality she has!
Yes, a little too sweet.
Yes, that’s for sure.
Oh, it’s dreadful, dreadful, Iago!
If you still feel so affectionate toward her, then why not give her permission to cheat on you?
If it doesn’t bother you, it won’t bother anyone else.
I’ll chop her into pieces.
How could she cheat on me?
Oh, it’s horrible of her.
And with my own officer!
That’s worse.
Get me some poison tonight, Iago.
I won’t argue with her, so her beautiful body won’t disarm me.—Tonight, Iago.
Don’t do it with poison.
Strangle her in her bed, the same bed she’s contaminated.
Good, good, I like that—it’s only fair!
Very good!
And let me kill Cassio.
You’ll hear more from me by midnight.
Excellent, good.
