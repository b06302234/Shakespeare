Give the king the letters I’ve sent, and come to me as fast as you would run from death.
I’ve got things to tell you that will make you speechless, and they aren’t even half the story.
These guys will take you to me.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are on their way to England.
I have a lot to tell you about them.
Good-bye.
Your trusted friend,      Hamlet.” Come, men.
I’ll show you where to deliver these letters as quickly as possible, so that you can take me to the man who sent them.
