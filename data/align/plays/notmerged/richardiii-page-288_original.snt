What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
Your Highness told me I should post before.
My mind is changed.
Stanley, what news with you?
None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing, Nor none so bad but well may be reported.
Hoyday, a riddle!
Neither good nor bad.
What needâ€™st thou run so many mile about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way?
Once more, what news?
Richmond is on the seas.
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
White-livered runagate, what doth he there?
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
Well, as you guess?
Stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton, He makes for England, here to claim the crown.
