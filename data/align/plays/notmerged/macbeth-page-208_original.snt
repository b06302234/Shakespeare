They have tied me to a stake.
I cannot fly, But, bearlike, I must fight the course.
What’s he That was not born of woman?
Such a one Am I to fear, or none.
What is thy name?
Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it.
No, though thou call’st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell.
My name’s Macbeth.
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear.
No, nor more fearful.
Thou liest, abhorrèd tyrant.
With my sword I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.
Thou wast born of woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandished by man that’s of a woman born.
