I, that was washed to death with fulsome wine, Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death.
Tomorrow in the battle think on me, And fall thy edgeless sword.
Despair, and die!
The wrongèd heirs of York do pray for thee Good angels guard thy battle.
Live and flourish.
Rivers, that died at Pomfret.
Despair, and die!
Think upon Vaughan, and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance.
Despair, and die!
Awake, and think our wrongs in Richard’s bosom Will conquer him!
Awake, and win the day.
