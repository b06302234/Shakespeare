Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
Anything.
Do not desire to see this letter.
This is, to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again.
Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.
I know thee well.
How dost thou, my good fellow?
Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.
Just the contrary.
The better for thy friends.
No, sir, the worse.
How can that be?
