Stay, on thy peril.
I alone will go.
Oh, I am out of breath in this fond chase.
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies, For she hath blessèd and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright?
Not with salt tears.
If so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear, For beasts that meet me run away for fear.
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne?
Dead or asleep?
I see no blood, no wound.— Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.
Transparent Helena!
Nature shows art That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
Where is Demetrius?
Oh, how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
Do not say so, Lysander.
Say not so.
What though he love your Hermia?
Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you.
Then be content.
Content with Hermia?
No.
I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
Not Hermia but Helena I love.
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
The will of man is by his reason swayed, And reason says you are the worthier maid.
