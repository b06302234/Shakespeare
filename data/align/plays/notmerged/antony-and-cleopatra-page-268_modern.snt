Let’s speak to him.
Let’s listen to him.
He may say something concerning Caesar.
Good idea.
But he’s sleeping.
It looks more like he fainted.
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep.
Let’s go to him.
Wake up, sir, wake up.
Speak to us.
Do you hear us, sir?
The hand of death has taken him.
Listen.
The drums softly wake the sleepers.
Let’s carry him to the barracks.
He’s an important person.
Our hour is up.
Come on, then.
He may recover yet.
