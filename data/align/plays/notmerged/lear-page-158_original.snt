Here is the place, my lord.
Good my lord, enter.
The tyranny of the open night’s too rough For nature to endure.
Let me alone.
Good my lord, enter here.
Wilt break my heart?
I had rather break mine own.
Good my lord, enter.
Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin.
So ’tis to thee.
But where the greater malady is fixed The lesser is scarce felt.
Thou’dst shun a bear, But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea Thou’dst meet the bear i' th' mouth.
When the mind’s free, The body’s delicate.
The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there—filial ingratitude.
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to ’t?
But I will punish home.
No, I will weep no more.
In such a night To shut me out!
Pour on, I will endure.
In such a night as this!
O Regan, Goneril, Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all— Oh, that way madness lies.
Let me shun that.
No more of that.
