Mistress, your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister’s room.
You know tomorrow is her wedding day.
Farewell to both of you, dear teachers.
I have to go.
But there’s reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster.
He acts like a man in love.
But if Bianca is so vulgar as to stoop for any man she sees, the hell with her.
Whoever wants her can have her.
The first time I catch her straying, it’s over.
End of story.
