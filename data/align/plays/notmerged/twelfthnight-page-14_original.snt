What’s that to the purpose?
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats.
He’s a very fool and a prodigal.
Fie, that you’ll say so!
He plays o' the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.
He hath indeed, almost natural, for besides that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreler, and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarreling, ’tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him.
Who are they?
They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.
With drinking healths to my niece.
I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria.
He’s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish top.
What, wench!
Sir Toby Belch!
How now, Sir Toby Belch!
Sweet Sir Andrew!
