Why art thou angry?
That such a slave as this should wear a sword, Who wears no honesty.
Such smiling rogues as these, Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain Which are too intrinse t' unloose, smooth every passion That in the natures of their lords rebel, Bring oil to fire, snow to the colder moods; Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks With every gale and vary of their masters, Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.— A plague upon your epileptic visage!
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool?
Goose, an I had you upon Sarum plain, I’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
Say that.
No contraries hold more antipathy Than I and such a knave.
Why dost thou call him “knave”?
What’s his offense?
His countenance likes me not.
No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers.
Sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain.
I have seen better faces in my time Than stands on any shoulder that I see Before me at this instant.
