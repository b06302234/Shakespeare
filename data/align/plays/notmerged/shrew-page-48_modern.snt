Tranio, let’s go.
One last thing, and this is up to you.
You’ll have to woo Bianca like the rest.
Don’t ask why.
Just trust me—I know what I’m doing.
No, no.
I am.
Really.
Very impressive.
Is there any more, or is that it?
And what an excellent piece of work it is, too, madam lady!
I wish it were over.
