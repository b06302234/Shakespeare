But how long will “ever” last?
Until her beautiful life’s end.
But how long will her beautiful life last?
As long as heaven and nature extend it.
As long as hell and Richard want it.
Tell her that I, her king, am her lowly subject.
But she, your subject, hates such a king.
Be eloquent on my behalf.
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply.
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms.
You can’t tell a story simply when it’s a lie.
Your answers are too shallow and too hasty.
Oh no, my reasons are deep and as permanent as death.
They’re buried as deep as my poor infants in their grave.
Don’t harp on that point, madam—it’s past.
I will harp on it till my heartstrings break.
Now, by St. George, my knighthood, and my crown— The first you profaned, the second you dishonored, and the third you stole.
