Prison, my lord?
Denmark’s a prison.
Then is the world one.
A goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
We think not so, my lord.
Why, then, ’tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.
To me it is a prison.
Why then, your ambition makes it one.
Tis too narrow for your mind.
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows.
Shall we to th' court?
For by my fay, I cannot reason.
We’ll wait upon you.
