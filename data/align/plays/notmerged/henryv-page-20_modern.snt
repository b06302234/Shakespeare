To this day, the kings of France follow this unspoken rule, even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line.
They prefer to obscure matters rather than reveal how corrupt their own claims to the French crown are.
They usurped that crown from you and your ancestors.
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim?
If not, mighty sovereign, let the blame be mine.
For it is written in the book of Numbers: “When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, claim what is yours.
Unfurl your banners of war.
Take your mighty ancestors as models.
Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather, from whom your own title to the crown derives.
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince, your great-uncle, who fought a tragic battle on French soil, routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop, smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen.
O noble English, who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces, leaving the other half to stand by, idle and laughing.
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again.
You are their heir and sit on their throne, and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins.
You, my most powerful sovereign, are in the very prime of youth, ripe for glorious deeds and great enterprises.
