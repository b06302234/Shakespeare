How’s it going, Shylock?
What’s the news among the merchants?
You knew—no one knew, no one knew as well as you did—about my daughter’s plans to run away.
That’s true.
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off.
And Shylock knew his daughter was ready to run away.
It’s natural for children to leave their parents.
She’ll be damned for it.
That’s true—if the devil’s judging her.
My own flesh and blood turned against me!
A rebel!
No!
Your  I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood.
You two are totally different.
Your flesh is more different from hers than coal is from ivory.
There’s more difference between your bloods than between red wine and white.
But tell us, did you hear anything about Antonio’s loss at sea?
