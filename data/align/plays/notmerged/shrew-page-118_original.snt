Our fine musician groweth amorous.
To learn the order of my fingering I must begin with rudiments of art, To teach you gamut in a briefer sort, More pleasant, pithy, and effectual Than hath been taught by any of my trade.
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
Call you this “gamut”?
Tut, I like it not.
Old fashions please me best.
I am not so nice To change true rules for old inventions.
