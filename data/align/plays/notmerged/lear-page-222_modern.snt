Oh, the poor man!
Have you heard about Albany’s and Cornwall’s troops?
I have.
They’re on the march.
Well, sir, I’ll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while.
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer.
When I’ve revealed my true identity, you’ll be glad you took the time to help me out.
Please come with me.
