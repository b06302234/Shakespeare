Read the will.
We’ll hear it, Antony.
You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.
Will you be patient?
Will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.
I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.
I do fear it.
They were traitors!
Honorable men”!
The will!
The testament!
They were villains, murderers.
The will!
Read the will!
You will compel me, then, to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend?
And will you give me leave?
Come down.
Descend.
You shall have leave.
A ring!
Stand round.
Stand from the hearse.
Stand from the body.
Room for Antony, most noble Antony!
