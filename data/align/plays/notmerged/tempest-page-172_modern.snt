My plans are almost at their climax.
My spells are working well, my spirits are obeying me, and everything is right on schedule.
What time is it?
It’s after six o'clock, my lord, when you said our work would be finished.
That’s what I said when I first conjured the tempest.
Tell me, spirit, how’s the king and his entourage?
All cooped up together, just as you ordered, all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather.
They can’t move till you release them.
The king, his brother, and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind, and the rest are grieving over them, sad and astonished.
Good old lord Gonzalo,” as you call him, is saddest of all, with tears running down his beard.
Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now, you’d feel sorry for them.
Do you think so, spirit?
I’d feel sorry for them, if I were human.
