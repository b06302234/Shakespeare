Is it possible?
Yes, please tell me.
So there I was, caught in their evil net.
Before I could even start processing the situation, they had started the ball rolling.
I sat down and wrote out a new official document with new instructions.
I wrote it in a bureaucrat’s neat handwriting.
I used to think having nice handwriting was for servants, just like our politicians think, and I had to work hard to overcome that prejudice—but it sure came in handy then.
Do you want to know what I wrote?
Yes, my lord.
A sincere plea from the king, who commands the respect of England, and who hopes that the love between the two countries can flourish, and that peace can join them in friendship—and other fancy mumbo jumbo like that—saying that, once they read this document, without any debate, the ones delivering the letter should be put to death immediately, without giving them time to confess to a priest.
But how could you put an official seal on it?
