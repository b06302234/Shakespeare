I would they were, that I might die at once, For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears, Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops.
These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear— No, when my father York and Edward wept To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him; Nor when thy warlike father, like a child, Told the sad story of my father’s death And twenty times made pause to sob and weep, That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks Like trees bedashed with rain—in that sad time, My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear; And what these sorrows could not thence exhale Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I never sued to friend, nor enemy; My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word.
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee, My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
Teach not thy lip such scorn, for it were made For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword, Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry— But ’twas thy beauty that provokèd me.
Nay, now dispatch; ’twas I that stabbed young Edward— But ’twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
