Where’s Potpan?
Why isn’t he helping us clear the table?
He should be moving and scraping plates!
When only one or two men have all the good manners, and even they are dirty, things are bad.
Take away the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.
You, good friend, save me a piece of marzipan, and if you love me, have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony and Potpan!
Yes, boy, I’m ready.
They’re looking for you in the great chamber.
We can’t be in two places at once, both here and there!
Cheers, boys.
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything.
Welcome, gentlemen.
The ladies who don’t have corns on their toes will dance with you.
Ha, my ladies, which of you will refuse to dance now?
Whichever of you acts shy, I’ll swear she has corns.
Does that hit close to home?
Welcome, gentlemen.
There was a time when I could wear a mask over my eyes and charm a lady by whispering a story in her ear.
That time is gone, gone, gone.
You are welcome gentlemen.
Come on, musicians, play music.
