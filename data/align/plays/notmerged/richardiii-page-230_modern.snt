Everyone stand aside.—Cousin Buckingham.
My gracious king.
Give me your hand.
Because of your advice and your help, I have a high position now.
But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time?
Let them last forever.
Oh Buckingham, now I’m going to test to see if you’re truly made of gold.
Young Prince Edward is still alive—what do you think I’m going to say next?
Go on, my loving lord.
Why, Buckingham, I say I want to be king.
Why, you are king, your highness.
Ha!
Am I king?
I guess I am.
But Edward is still alive.
True, noble prince.
