O learnèd judge!—Mark, Jew, a learnèd judge!
I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go.
Here is the money.
Soft!
The Jew shall have all justice.
Soft, no haste.
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
O Jew!
An upright judge, a learnèd judge!
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh.
If thou takest more Or less than a just pound, be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple—nay, if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
A second Daniel!—A Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
Why doth the Jew pause?
Take thy forfeiture.
Give me my principal, and let me go.
I have it ready for thee.
Here it is.
