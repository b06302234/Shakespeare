A league from Epidamnum had we sailed Before the always-wind-obeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm; But longer did we not retain much hope; For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death, Which though myself would gladly have embraced, Yet the incessant weepings of my wife, Weeping before for what she saw must come, And piteous plainings of the pretty babes, That mourned for fashion, ignorant what to fear, Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
And this it was, for other means was none: The sailors sought for safety by our boat And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.
My wife, more careful for the latter-born, Had fastened him unto a small spare mast, Such as seafaring men provide for storms.
To him one of the other twins was bound, Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
The children thus disposed, my wife and I, Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed, Fastened ourselves at either end the mast And, floating straight, obedient to the stream, Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, Dispersed those vapors that offended us, And by the benefit of his wished light The seas waxed calm, and we discoverèd Two ships from far, making amain to us, Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
But ere they came,–O, let me say no more!
Gather the sequel by that went before.
