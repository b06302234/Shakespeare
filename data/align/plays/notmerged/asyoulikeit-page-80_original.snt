More at your request than to please myself.
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you.
But that they call “compliment” is like th' encounter of two dog- apes.
And when a man thanks me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks.
Come, sing.
And you that will not, hold your tongues.
Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree.—He hath been all this day to look you.
And I have been all this day to avoid him.
He is too disputable for my company.
I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them.
Come, warble, come.
I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention.
