Who’s there?
My young master!
Oh, my gentle master!
My sweet master!
Oh, you living memory of old Sir Rowland!
What are you doing here?
Why are you so strong and good?
Why do people love you?
And why are you noble, strong, and brave?
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion?
Your praise has beaten you home.
Don’t you know, master, that some men’s best qualities do them in?
Yours are like that—complete and utter traitors to you.
Oh, what a world this is, when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him!
Why, what’s the matter?
Oh, unlucky boy!
Don’t walk through these doors.
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you.
Oliver, your brother—no, not your brother; and yet he’s the son—but no, I won’t call him the son—of that great man I was about to call his father, has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match, and tonight he’s planning on burning your house down, with you in it.
And if he fails at that, he will find other ways to kill you.
I overheard him and his plans.
This is no place for you; this home is now a slaughterhouse.
Hate it, fear it, do not come inside.
