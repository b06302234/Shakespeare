Let’s seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out.
Instead of crying, let’s keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men.
Each day new widows howl, new orphans cry, and new sorrows slap heaven in the face, until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland’s anguish and screams in pain.
I will avenge whatever I believe is wrong.
And I’ll believe whatever I’m sure is true.
And I’ll put right whatever I can when the time comes.
What you just said may perhaps be true.
This tyrant, whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it, was once considered an honest man.
You were one of his favorites.
He hasn’t done anything to harm you yet.
I’m inexperienced, but maybe you’re planning to win Macbeth’s favor by betraying me to him.
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth.
I am not treacherous.
But Macbeth is.
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command.
But I beg your pardon.
My fears can’t actually make you evil.
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer, the brightest angel, fell from heaven.
Even though everything evil wants to look good, good still has to look good too.
