I am arrogant, vengeful, ambitious, with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts, and more than I have time to carry it out in.
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven?
Every one of us is a criminal.
Don’t believe any of us.
Hurry to a convent.
Where’s your father?
He’s at home, my lord.
Lock him in, so he can play the fool in his own home only.
Good-bye.
Oh, dear God, please help him!
If you marry, I’ll give you this curse as your wedding present—be as clean as ice, as pure as the driven snow, and you’ll still get a bad reputation.
Get yourself to a convent, at once.
Good-bye.
Or if you have to get married, marry a fool, since wise men know far too well that you’ll cheat on them.
Good-bye.
Dear God, please make him normal again!
I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too.
God gives you one face, but you paint another on top of it.
You dance and prance and lisp; you call God’s creations by pet names, and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance.
Come on, I won’t stand for it anymore.
It’s driven me crazy.
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage.
Whoever is already married (except one person I know) will stay married—all but one person.
Everyone else will have to stay single.
Get yourself to a convent, fast.
