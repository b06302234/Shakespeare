As roughly as my modesty would let me.
Haply in private.
And in assemblies too.
Ay, but not enough.
It was the copy of our conference.
In bed he slept not for my urging it; At board he fed not for my urging it.
Alone, it was the subject of my theme; In company I often glancèd it.
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
And thereof came it that the man was mad.
The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth.
It seems his sleeps were hinder’d by thy railing, And therefore comes it that his head is light.
Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings.
Unquiet meals make ill digestions.
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred, And what’s a fever but a fit of madness?
Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls.
Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue But moody and dull melancholy, Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, And at her heels a huge infectious troop Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest To be disturbed, would mad or man or beast.
The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.
