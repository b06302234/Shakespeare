I have sent after him.
He says he’ll come.
How shall I feast him?
What bestow of him?
For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow’d.
I speak too loud.— Where’s Malvolio?
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.
Where is Malvolio?
He’s coming, madam; but in very strange manner.
He is sure possessed, madam.
Why, what’s the matter?
Does he rave?
No, madam, he does nothing but smile.
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits.
Go call him hither.
I am as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be.
How now, Malvolio?
Sweet lady, ho, ho.
