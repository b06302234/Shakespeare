Friends to this ground.
And liegemen to the Dane.
Give you good night.
O, farewell, honest soldier.
Who hath relieved you?
Barnardo has my place.
Give you good night.
Holla, Barnardo.
Say what, is Horatio there?
A piece of him.
Welcome, Horatio.—Welcome, good Marcellus.
What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
I have seen nothing.
Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.
