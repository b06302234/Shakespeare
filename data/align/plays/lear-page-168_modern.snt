Who are you?
What are your names?
Poor Tom, who eats frogs, toads, tadpoles, lizards, and newts.
When the devil tells me to, I eat cow dung for salads, I swallow old rats and dead dogs, I drink pond scum.
In every village I’m whipped and put in the stocks, punished and imprisoned.
But I used to be a respectable servant, with three suits and six shirts.
Once I had a horse to ride and a sword to wear, but now poor Tom’s been eating rats and mice for seven long years.
Beware of the devil who follows me around.
Calm down, Smulkin, you fiend!
Oh, the devil is quite a gentleman.
He’s called Modo and Mahu.
Poor Tom’s chilly.
Come back to my house with me.
I couldn’t bear to obey all of your daughters' harsh orders.
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm, but I’ve come out here to find you and take you where there’s warmth and food.
First let me talk with this philosopher here.—
