I swear— By nothing, because this is no oath.
St. George loses his holiness once  Then, by myself— You’ve misused yourself.
Now, by the world— It’s full of your ugly wrongdoings.
By my father’s death— Your life has dishonored his death.
Why then, by God— You wrong God most of all.
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him, you wouldn’t have ruined the united front the king, my husband, created before he died, and you wouldn’t have killed my brothers.
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him, the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child, and both princes would still be alive, not preyed on by worms.
What can you swear by now?
