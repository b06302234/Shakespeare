Take away this lout and whip him.
By the moon and stars!
Whip him!
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand—what’s her name now?
This woman who once was Cleopatra, but now has become something different?
Whip him, fellows, until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy!
Take him away.
Mark Antony— Pull him away, and once he has been whipped, bring him back.
Caesar’s knave will bring him a message for us.
My good lord— You’ve always been a liar.
But when our vices become habits—Oh, the sadness of it!—the wise gods blind us, shade our better judgment, make us love our mistakes, and laugh as we strut to our ruin.
