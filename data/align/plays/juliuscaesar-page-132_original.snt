What does he say of Brutus?
He says for Brutus' sake He finds himself beholding to us all.
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
Nay, that’s certain.
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
Peace!
Let us hear what Antony can say.
You gentle Romans—     Peace, ho!
Let us hear him.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones.
So let it be with Caesar.
The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest— For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men— Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me.
But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
