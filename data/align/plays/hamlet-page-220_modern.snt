I’ve sent men to find him and retrieve the body.
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose!
But we can’t throw him in jail.
The people love him, because they judge based on appearance rather than reason.

But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all.
So what’s happened?
We can’t get him to tell us where he’s put the body.
But where is he?
Outside, my lord, under guard, waiting for your orders.
Bring him to me.
Hey, Guildenstern!
Bring in my lord.
Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?
