Having once this juice, I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
The next thing then she waking looks upon— Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey or on busy ape— She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
And ere I take this charm from of her sight— As I can take it with another herb— I’ll make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here?
I am invisible.
And I will overhear their conference.
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I’ll stay, the other stayeth me.
Thou told’st me they were stol'n unto this wood.
And here am I, and wood within this wood, Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant.
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart Is true as steel.
Leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you.
Do I entice you?
Do I speak you fair?
Or rather, do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not, nor I cannot, love you?
