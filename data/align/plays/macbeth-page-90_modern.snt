Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you.
Wasn’t it just yesterday that we spoke to each other?
It was yesterday, your highness.
Well, did you think about what I said?
You should know that it was Banquo who made your lives hell for so long, which you always thought was my fault.
But I was innocent.
I showed you the proof at our last meeting.
I explained how you were deceived, how you were thwarted, the things that were used against you, who was working against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say, “Banquo did it!” You explained it all.
I did that and more, which brings me to the point of this second meeting.
Are you so patient and forgiving that you’re going to let him off the hook?
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children, a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever?
We are men, my lord.
Yes, you’re part of the species called men.
Just as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, mutts, shaggy lapdogs, swimming dogs, and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs.
But if you list the different kinds of dogs according to their qualities, you can distinguish which breeds are fast or slow, which ones are clever, which ones are watchdogs, and which ones hunters.
You can classify each dog according to the natural gifts that separate it from all other dogs.
It’s the same with men.
Now, if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom, tell me.
Because if that’s the case, I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me.
As long as Banquo lives, I am sick.
I’ll be healthy when he is dead.
