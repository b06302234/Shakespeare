Please forgive me, master.
I’ll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining.
Do that, and I’ll set you free in two days.
That’s noble of you, master.
What shall I do for you?
Just tell me.
What shall I do?
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph.
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me.
Take this garment, put it on, and then come back here.
Hurry, go!
Shake off your sleepiness.
Come on.
We’ll go visit Caliban, my slave who always talks to us so nastily.
