tries to help Cassio, the more she’ll shake Othello’s confidence in her.
And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all.
Hello, Roderigo!
I’m totally worn out.
My chase is too much for me.
I’ve spent most of my money, and tonight I got beaten up.
The upshot is that I’ve got a little more experience.
So with no money, but a little more wisdom, I’m going back to Venice.
You’re a poor man if you’re this impatient!
If you get hurt, does your wound heal immediately?
No, it heals gradually.
We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic, and intelligent planning takes time.
Aren’t things going well?
Cassio’s beaten you up, but with that tiny sacrifice on your part, you got Cassio discharged!
If we’re patient, we’ll be rewarded with the fruits of our labors.
My God, it’s morning.
All this excitement has made the time fly by.
Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep.
Go on, I’m telling you.
You’ll understand better later.
Go.
