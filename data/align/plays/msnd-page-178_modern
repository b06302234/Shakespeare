And we fairies, who run away from the sun just like the goddess of the night, following darkness like a dream, are getting antsy.
But I’m here to make sure that not even a mouse disturbs this blessed house.
I’ve been sent to clean house a bit before the fairies come.
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house.
I want every elf and fairy to hop lightly, like a bird on a twig, and to sing and dance this song along with me.
First rehearse your song from memory, and make sure each note is pretty.
We’ll all join hands and sing, and bless this place with our fairy grace.
