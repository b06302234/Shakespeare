By my troth, a good song.
And an ill singer, my lord.
Ha, no, no, faith, thou sing’st well enough for a shift.
they would have hanged him.
And I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief.
I had as lief have heard the night raven, come what plague could have come after it.
Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar?
I pray thee, get us some excellent music, for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero’s chamber window
