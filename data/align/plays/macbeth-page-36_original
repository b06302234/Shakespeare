This castle hath a pleasant seat.
The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.
This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet, does approve, By his loved mansionry, that the heavenâ€™s breath Smells wooingly here.
No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The air is delicate.
See, see, our honored hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love.
Herein I teach you How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains, And thank us for your trouble.
All our service, In every point twice done and then done double, Were poor and single business to contend Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your majesty loads our house.
For those of old, And the late dignities heaped up to them, We rest your hermits.
