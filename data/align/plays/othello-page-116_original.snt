That she repeals him for her body’s lust.
And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all.
How now, Roderigo!
I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry.
My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains.
And so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does’t not go well?
Cassio hath beaten thee.
And thou, by that small hurt, hath cashiered Cassio.
Though other things grow fair against the sun, Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
Content thyself awhile.
In troth, ’tis morning.
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee, go where thou art billeted.
Away, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter.
Nay, get thee gone.
