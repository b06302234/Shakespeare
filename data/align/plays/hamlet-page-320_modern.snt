And if that’s true, then Hamlet is the victim of his own illness—his illness is his enemy.
Sir, with this audience as witness, let me declare that I’m as innocent of premeditated evil against you as I would be if I had happened to shoot an arrow over my house and accidentally hit my brother.
My feelings are satisfied—even though what you have done to my father and sister should drive me to revenge.
Yet when it comes to my honor, I can’t forgive you so fast.
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so.
Until then I will accept your love as love.
I’m grateful for your love.
Come on, give us the swords, and we will play this friendly fencing match enthusiastically.
Yes, hand me one too.
I’m going to make you look sharp, Laertes.
I’m so bad at the game that your skill will shine like the brightest star in the darkest night.
You’re making fun of me.
No, I swear I’m not.
Give them the swords, Osric.
Hamlet, you know the bet?
Yes, my lord, quite well.
You’ve bet on the weaker fencer.
