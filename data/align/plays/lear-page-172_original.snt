The grief hath crazed my wits.
What a night’s this!
O, cry your mercy, sir.—        Tom’s a-cold.
In, fellow.
There, into th' hovel.
Keep thee warm.
Come let’s in all.
This way, my lord.
With him!
I will keep still with my philosopher.
Good my lord, soothe him.
Let him take the fellow.
Take him you on.
Come, good Athenian.
No words, no words.
Hush.
Child Roland to the dark tower came, His word was still “Fie, foh, and fum, I smell the blood of a British man.”
