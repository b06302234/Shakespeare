Let’s say I didn’t kill them.
Then you might as well say they’re not dead.
But they are dead, and you killed them, you slave of the devil.
I did not kill your husband.
Well, then he must be alive.
No, he is dead.
Edward killed him.
You’re lying.
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood.
It was the same sword you almost killed her with—and you would have killed her if my brothers hadn’t fought you off.
She provoked me with her lying mouth, accusing me of crimes I didn’t commit.
No, what provoked you was your own bloody mind, which never thinks about anything but butchering.
You killed this king, didn’t you?
Yes, I’ll grant you that.
You’ll grant me, you hedgehog?
Then let God grant me that you’ll be damned for that wicked deed.
Oh, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.
That will please God, who has him now.
He is in heaven, where you will never go.
Let him thank me, who helped him get there.
He’s better suited to be there than here.
