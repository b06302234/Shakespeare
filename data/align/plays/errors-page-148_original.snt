And with no face (as ’twere) outfacing me, Cries out I was possessed.
Then all together They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence, And in a dark and dankish vault at home There left me and my man, both bound together, Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder, I gained my freedom and immediately Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech To give me ample satisfaction For these deep shames and great indignities.
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him: That he dined not at home, but was locked out.
But had he such a chain of thee or no?
He had, my lord, and when he ran in here, These people saw the chain about his neck.
Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first forswore it on the mart, And thereupon I drew my sword on you, And then you fled into this abbey here, From whence I think you are come by miracle.
I never came within these abbey walls, Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me.
I never saw the chain, so help me heaven, And this is false you burden me withal.
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup.
If here you housed him, here he would have been.
