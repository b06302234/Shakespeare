Oh, but now you have fallen into a pit of ink, and there’s not enough water in the whole wide sea to wash you clean again, and not enough salt to cover your stink.
Sir, sir, calm down.
I’m so amazed by this, I don’t know what to say.
Oh, on my soul, my cousin has been slandered falsely!
Lady, did you sleep in her room last night?
No, I didn’t, but I did every night for the past year.
Then it’s confirmed!
That’s even more proof, and the case against her was airtight already.
Would the two princes and Claudio lie?
Claudio, who loved her so much that talking about her wickedness made him weep?
Listen to me a moment.
I’ve only remained silent this whole time because I’ve been watching Hero.
I’ve seen her begin to blush a thousand times, only to watch those blushes disappear a thousand times and an innocent paleness take over her face.
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity.
Call me a fool, don’t trust my observations—the truth of which is backed up by all my years of experience—don’t trust my age, my reputation, my position, and my holiness.
