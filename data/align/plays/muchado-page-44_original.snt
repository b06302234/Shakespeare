Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
I have a good eye, uncle.
I can see a church by daylight.
The revelers are entering, brother.
Make good room.
Lady, will you walk a bout with your friend?
So you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say nothing, I am yours for the walk, and especially when I walk away.
With me in your company?
I may say so when I please.
And when please you to say so?
When I like your favor, for God defend the lute should be like the case!
My visor is Philemonâ€™s roof; within the house is Jove.
