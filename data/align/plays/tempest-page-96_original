What have we here?
A man or a fish?
Dead or alive?
A fish.
He smells like a fish, a very ancient and fish-like smell, a kind of not-of-the-newest poor-john.
A strange fish!
Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver.
There would this monster make a man.
Any strange beast there makes a man.
When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian.
Legged like a man and his fins like arms!
Warm, o' my troth.
I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt.
Alas, the storm is come again!
My best way is to creep under his gaberdine.
There is no other shelter hereabouts.
Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.
I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral.
Well, here’s my comfort.
