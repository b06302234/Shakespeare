Are you going riding this afternoon?
Yes, my good lord.
We would have liked to have heard your good advice, which has always been serious and helpful, at the council today, but we’ll wait until tomorrow.
Are you riding far?
I’m going far enough that I’ll be riding from now until dinner.
Unless my horse goes faster than expected, I will be back an hour or two after sunset.
Don’t miss our feast.
My lord, I won’t miss it.
We hear that the princes, those murderers, have hidden in England and Ireland.
They haven’t confessed to cruelly murdering their own father, and they’ve been making up strange lies to tell their hosts.
But we can talk more about that tomorrow, when we’ll discuss matters of state that concern us both.
Hurry up and get to your horse.
Good-bye, until you return tonight.
Is Fleance going with you?
Yes, my good lord.
It’s time we hit the road.
I hope your horses are fast and surefooted.
And with that, I send you to them.
Farewell.
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight.
In order to make your company even more enjoyable, I’m going to keep to myself until suppertime.
Until then, God be with you!
