In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens.
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide.
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud.
For the next two hours, we will watch the story of their doomed love and their parents' anger, which nothing but the children’s deaths could stop.
If you listen to us patiently, we’ll make up for everything we’ve left out in this prologue onstage.
