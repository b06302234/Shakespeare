Fellow soldiers and my loyal friends suffering under that tyrant Richard, we have marched all the way to the center of England without encountering any opposition.
And now we receive encouraging news from my stepfather Stanley: Richard—that violent, greedy boar who roots through your summer fields and ripening vines, guzzles your warm blood, and makes his trough in your disemboweled bellies—is now near the town of Leicester, only one day’s march from us here in  Every man’s conscience is a thousand swords against this murderer.
I suspect his friends will join us.
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him.
In his greatest need, even they will desert him.
All to our advantage.
So, in God’s name, let’s march.
Hope with good cause is swift; it flies as fast as a swallow.
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings.
