Have you so soon forgot the entertainment Her sister Katherina welcomed you withal?
The patroness of heavenly harmony.
Then give me leave to have prerogative, And when in music we have spent an hour, Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
To know the cause why music was ordained.
Was it not to refresh the mind of man After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy And, while I pause, serve in your harmony.
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
I am no breeching scholar in the schools.
Iâ€™ll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down.
