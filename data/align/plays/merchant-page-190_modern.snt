No, he refused it publicly, in open court.
He will have only justice and his penalty.
A Daniel, I keep saying it!
A second Daniel!—Thank you, Jew, for teaching me that word.
I won’t even get the original three thousand ducats back?
You can’t have anything but the penalty, to be taken at your peril, Jew.
Well, then, I hope he chokes on it!
I’m not staying here to argue anymore.
Wait a minute, Jew.
The law has another hold on you.
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen, the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner’s goods.
The other half goes to the state.
Whether the offending person lives or dies is up to the duke—there’s no one else to appeal to.
In your predicament you’ve earned that punishment, because you’ve clearly contrived indirectly—and directly too—to take the life of the defendant.
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke.
