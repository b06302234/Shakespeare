Most noble man, will you die?
Don’t you care about me?
Shall I stay in this dreary world, which is no better than a pigsty without you?
Oh, look, ladies.
The best of the world disappears.
My lord!
Oh, the glory of war has faded.
The flags have fallen.
Young boys and girls are equal to men.
There is nothing distinctive, nothing remarkable left in the world.
Oh, stay calm, lady!
Our Queen is dead too.
Lady!
Madam!
Oh, madam, madam, madam!
Royal Egypt, Empress!
Quiet, quiet, Iras.
Now I am no more than a woman, ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores.
I might now hurl my scepter at the destructive gods and tell them that this earthly world was as good as their heavenly one, until they stole away its jewel, Antony.
Now all is for nothing.
Patience is foolish.
Impatience suits a mad dog.
So why should it be a sin to rush toward death, to seek it out in its hiding place before it dares to come to find me?
How are you, my ladies?
Tell me!
Cheer up!
How are you, Charmian?
My gallant girls!
Ah, ladies, look: the light of our lives has gone out.
Good noble ladies, be brave.
We’ll bury him, and then we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans, and make death proud to take us.
Come on, you can go.
The container of that great soul is now cold.
Ah, ladies, ladies!
Let’s go.
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death.
