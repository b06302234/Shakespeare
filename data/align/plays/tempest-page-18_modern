Oh, it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this, things that I can’t remember.
But please tell me more.
My brother, your uncle Antonio—just listen to this (I still can’t believe a brother could be so disloyal!
My brother whom—aside from you—I loved more than anyone else in the world, I trusted to run my state, which at that time was the strongest in the land, and Prospero the number one duke, famous for my dignity and my education.
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic, grammar, geometry, and astronomy, I let my control of the government slide a bit, being too wrapped up in my occult books.
Your disloyal uncle—are you paying attention?
I’m hanging on every word.
Once Antonio got the knack of granting certain requests, denying others, promoting some officials and keeping down those who were getting too ambitious, he won over the people who used to be mine, or changed them—remade them, you might say.
Since he had control over the whole government and everyone in it, he soon made everyone sing his own song—whichever song he happened to like.
He became like the ivy that sticks to the side of the tree, and sucked my vitality out of me.—You’re not paying attention.
Oh, yes I am, father.
