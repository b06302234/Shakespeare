Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good mooncalf.
How does thy honor?
Let me lick thy shoe.
Lo, how he mocks me!
Wilt thou let him, mylord?
Lord,” quoth he?
That a monster should be such a natural!
Lo, lo, again!
Bite him to death, I prithee.
Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head.
If you prove a mutineer, the next tree.
The poor monster’s my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.
I thank my noble lord.
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
Marry, will I. Kneel and repeat it.
I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.
