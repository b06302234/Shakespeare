Boy!
Signior?
In my chamber window lies a book.
Bring it hither to me in the orchard.
I am here already, sir.
I know that, but I would have thee hence and here again.
I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in loveâ€” and such a man is Claudio.
I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe.
I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet.
He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier, and now is he turned orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes.
May I be so converted and see with these eyes?
I cannot tell; I think not.
