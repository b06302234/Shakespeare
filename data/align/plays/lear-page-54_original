Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee.
Let me hire him too.—Here’s my coxcomb.
How now, my pretty knave?
How dost thou?
Why, Fool?
Why?
For taking one’s part that’s out of favor.
Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly.
There, take my coxcomb.
Why, this fellow has banished two on ’s daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will.
If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.—How now, nuncle?
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters.
