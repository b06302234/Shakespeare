Go ahead, Moon.
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon, I’m the man in the moon, this thornbush is my thornbush, and this dog is my dog.
Well, all of these should be in the lantern, because they’re all in the moon.
But be quiet, here comes Thisbe.
This is old Ninny’s tomb.
But where is my love?
Good roaring, Lion!
Good running, Thisbe!
Good shining, Moon!—Really, the Moon shines very well.
That’s good, Lion!
Shake it around like a cat with a mouse.
