O Charmian, I will never go from hence.
Be comforted, dear madam.
No, I will not.
All strange and terrible events are welcome, But comforts we despise.
Our size of sorrow, Proportioned to our cause, must be as great As that which makes it.
How now?
Is he dead?
His death’s upon him, but not dead.
Look out o’ th’ other side your monument.
His guard have brought him thither.
O sun, Burn the great sphere thou mov’st in.
Darkling stand The varying shore o’ th’ world!
O Antony, Antony, Antony!
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Help, friends below!
Let’s draw him hither.
Peace!
Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony, But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself.
So it should be, that none but Antony Should conquer Antony, but woe ’tis so!
