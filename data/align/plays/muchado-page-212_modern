God save the charitable organization!
Go, you’re relieved of your duty.
Thank you.
I leave a slimy bastard with you, your Worship, for you to punish and make an example of.
God bless your Worship!
I wish you well.
I hope that God restores you to health.
I will humbly let you go now, God  I’ll see you tomorrow morning, gentlemen.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
We’ll see you tomorrow.
We’ll be there.
I will mourn Hero tonight.
