Yes, I am the one.
No, villain, but you didn’t work alone.
I don’t know how to ask you for forgiveness, but I have to say something.
Choose your revenge.
Punish me through any means you can devise, though I sinned by mistake.
Me too—but to satisfy this good old man, I too will bear any punishment he gives me.
I can’t ask you to make my daughter live—that’s impossible—but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died.
And if your love can produce something from its sadness, write a poem for her; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones.
Sing it tonight.
Then come to my house tomorrow morning, and since you couldn’t be my son-in-law, be my nephew instead.
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero; this girl is heir to both our estates.
Marry her as you should have married her cousin, and I will let my revenge die.
