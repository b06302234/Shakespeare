My conscience hath a thousand several tongues, And every tongue brings in a several tale, And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Perjury, perjury, in the highest degree; Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree; All several sins, all used in each degree, Throng to the bar, crying all, “Guilty!
guilty!” I shall despair.
There is no creature loves me, And if I die no soul will pity me.
And wherefore should they, since that I myself Find in myself no pity to myself?
Methought the souls of all that I had murdered Came to my tent, and every one did threat Tomorrow’s vengeance on the head of Richard.
My lord.
Zounds, who is there?
Ratcliffe, my lord, ’tis I.
The early village cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn.
Your friends are up and buckle on their armor.
O Ratcliffe, I have dreamed a fearful dream!
What think’st thou, will our friends prove all true?
No doubt, my lord.
O Ratcliffe, I fear, I fear.
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
