Oh, I’d kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could!
Killing him once is not enough revenge.
Now I see it’s true.
Oh, Iago, all the love I felt is gone, vanished in the wind.
Welcome, hatred and vengeance!
Get out of my heart, love!
My heart feels like it’s full of poisonous snakes!
Calm down— I want blood!
Be patient, I’m telling you.
You may change your mind later.
Never, Iago.
My thoughts of revenge are flowing through me like a violent river, never turning back to love, only flowing toward full revenge that’ll swallow them up.
I swear to God I’ll get revenge.
Don’t get up yet.
Let heaven be my witness—I’m putting my mind, my heart, and my hands in Othello’s control.
Let him command me, and I’ll do whatever he asks, no matter how violent.
