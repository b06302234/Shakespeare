Who’s there, aside from this foul weather?
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather, very troubled.
I know you.
Where’s the king?
Struggling with the wind and rain.
He’s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea, or make the sea flood the earth—he wants to see the world return to primal chaos.
He keeps tearing out his white hair, which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness.
Small but brave in his surroundings, he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth.
He’s running bareheaded, calling for the end of the world, out there on a night like this, when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide.
But who’s with him?
Nobody but the fool, who’s trying to soothe the wounds in the king’s heart with jokes.
