Good night, dear Captain Blunt.
Come, gentlemen, let’s discuss tomorrow’s action in my tent.
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors.
What time is it?
It’s dinnertime, my lord.
It’s nine o'clock.
I’m not going to eat dinner tonight.
Give me some ink and paper.
Is the visor of my helmet working better now?
And has my armor been put in my tent?
Yes, my lord.
Everything’s ready.
My good man Norfolk, hurry to your post.
Be careful whom you choose as guards—make sure they’re trustworthy.
I’m off, my lord.
Get up early tomorrow—at the sound of the lark—noble Norfolk.
I will, my lord.
Catesby.
