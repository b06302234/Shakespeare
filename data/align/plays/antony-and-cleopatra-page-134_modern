Let’s have one, good soldier.
Come, let’s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful.
Everyone join hands.
Attack our ears with loud music, and I’ll position you for the dance.
Then the boy will sing, and every man will sing the chorus at the top of his voice.
How can you top that?
Good night, Pompey.
