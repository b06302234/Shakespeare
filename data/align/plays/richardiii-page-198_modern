Here’s the indictment of the good Lord Hastings, which has been written out in a clear hand, like any legal document, so it can be read aloud in public outside St. Paul’s Cathedral.
And look how well this sequence of events holds together: after Catesby brought the indictment to me last night, I spent eleven hours copying it.
The original took just as long to write out.
So that’s twenty-two hours.
And yet five hours ago, Lord Hastings was alive, untouched, free, at liberty.
What a backward world we live in!
Why, who’s so stupid that he can’t see through this fraud?
But who’s so blind to the consequences of speaking out that he’ll admit what he knows?
The world is a bad place, where you can’t speak what you know.
