Like her?
Oh, Isis, that’s impossible.
You’re right, Charmian.
She’s both dull-spoken and dwarfishly little.—Did she carry herself with majesty?
Compare her to any memory you might have of royalty.
She creeps along.
Moving or standing still, her bearing is about the same.
She has a body, not a life.
She’s more like a statue than a living, breathing human being.
Is this true?

There aren’t three people in all of Egypt who could do better.
He’s very observant.
I can tell.
She doesn’t have anything going for her so far.
This messenger is wise.
Very wise.
She was a widow previously, madam.
A widow?
Do you hear that, Charmian?
And I think she’s at least thirty.
Do you remember her face?
Was it long or round?
Round enough to be unattractive.
Usually that means a person is foolish.
What color is her hair?
