So, with two seeming bodies but one heart, Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, Due but to one and crownèd with one crest.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly.
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it, Though I alone do feel the injury.
I am amazèd at your passionate words.
I scorn you not.
It seems that you scorn me.
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius— Who even but now did spurn me with his foot— To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare, Precious, celestial?
Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates?
And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love, so rich within his soul, And tender me, forsooth, affection, But by your setting on, by your consent?
What though I be not so in grace as you— So hung upon with love, so fortunate— But miserable most, to love unloved?
This you should pity rather than despise.
I understand not what you mean by this.
Ay, do.
Persever, counterfeit sad looks, Make mouths upon me when I turn my back, Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up— This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
