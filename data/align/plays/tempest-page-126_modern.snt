What an idiot this guy is!—You’re a rotten piece of work!—I beg your highness, beat him up and take his wine bottle from him.
When he loses that, he’ll be drinking salt water, since I’ll never tell him where the freshwater springs are.
Trinculo, watch out.
If you interrupt this monster with one more word, I’ll beat you like a piece of salted fish.
What did I do?
I didn’t do anything.
I need to get away from you.
Didn’t you call him a liar?
You lie.
I didn’t accuse you of lying.
Are you out of your mind and deaf too?
Damn your wine!
This is what happens when you drink too much.
Your monster can go to hell, and you can too!
Ha, ha, ha!
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story.—Please go stand farther away.
Beat him up.
After a little while, I’ll beat him too.
Stand farther away.— Come on, continue your story.
