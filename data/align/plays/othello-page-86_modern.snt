Our noble and courageous general Othello having been informed that the Turkish fleet has been completely destroyed, invites every man to celebrate our victory.
Some of you dance, some of you make bonfires, and every man celebrate in whatever way he likes to.
For besides the good news, we are also celebrating his marriage.
Thatâ€™s the end of the announcement.
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven.
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!
