Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
What bastard doth not?
Who will go with me?
I will proclaim my name about the field.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
A foe to tyrants, and my country’s friend.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I!
Brutus, my country’s friend.
Know me for Brutus!
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius, And mayst be honored, being Cato’s son.
Only I yield to die.
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight.
Kill Brutus, and be honored in his death.
We must not.
A noble prisoner!
