Ay me, it is my husband.
Witness you That he is borne about invisible.
Even now we housed him in the abbey here, And now he’s there, past thought of human reason.
Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice, Even for the service that long since I did thee When I bestrid thee in the wars and took Deep scars to save thy life.
Even for the blood That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.
Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there, She whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife, That hath abusèd and dishonored me Even in the strength and height of injury.
Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house.
A grievous fault.—Say, woman, didst thou so?
No, my good lord.
Myself, he, and my sister Today did dine together.
So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal.
Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth.
