Don’t speak of this again.
To none but you, only to you.
You will surely lose any game you play with Caesar.
With his natural luck, he will beat you even against the odds.
Your light dulls when he is near.
I repeat: your angel is afraid to inspire you when you’re around him, but when he goes away it becomes brilliant again.
Leave now.
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him.
Come here, Ventidius.
You must go to Parthia.
Your authorization is ready.
Come with me and I’ll get it for you.
