Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again.
We’ll watch them starve to death first.
Come on.
Come here, captain.
Listen.
I’ll do it, sir.
Then off you go.
When you’ve finished, you’ll be a happy man.
Go immediately, and do exactly as I wrote down.
Jobs are hard to come by.
I can’t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse.
If it’s work for a man, I’ll do it.
