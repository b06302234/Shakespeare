Is it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say?
Yes, it’s true, sir.
Who is leading his men?
They say Gloucester’s bastard son is.
I hear that Edgar, Gloucester’s exiled son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.
You can’t trust all the rumors.
It’s time to reassess the situation.
The British troops are coming near.
It will likely be a bloody fight.
Goodbye, sir.
My life and my plans completely depend on how today’s battle ends.
