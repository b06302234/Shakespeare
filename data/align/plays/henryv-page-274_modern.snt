precious marriage cause friendship and alliance between them and war never again threaten England or fair France with his bloody sword.
Amen.
Now, welcome, Kate.—And let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
May God, who is the best matchmaker, join your hearts and realms in one.
As man and wife, though two, are one in love, so let there be between your kingdoms such a marriage that neither wrongdoing nor fierce jealousy, which often trouble the sacred state of marriage, ever sever them.
And let Englishmen be French and Frenchmen English.
God say, “Amen”!
Amen!
Let us prepare for our wedding.—On that day, I’ll take your oath of loyalty, my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers, to guarantee my treaty.
Then I will swear to Kate and you to me, and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate.
