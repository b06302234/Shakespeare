What are you there?
Your names?
Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the tadpole, the wall newt, and the water; that in the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages, eats cow dung for salads, swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to tithing and stocked, punished and imprisoned; who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his body, Horse to ride and weapon to wear.
But mice and rats and such small deer Have been Tom’s food for seven long year.
Beware my follower.
Peace, Smulkin.
Peace, thou fiend!
The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman.
Modo he’s called, and Mahu.
That it doth hate what gets it.
Poor Tom’s a-cold.
Go in with me.
My duty cannot suffer To obey in all your daughters' hard commands.
Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you, Yet have I ventured to come seek you out And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
First let me talk with this philosopher.—
