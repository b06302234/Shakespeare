As sure as I’m standing here, I saw him.
Nonsense!
In ancient times, before there were laws to make the land safe and peaceful, a lot of blood was spilled.
Yes, and since then murders have been committed that are too awful to talk about.
It used to be that when you knocked a man’s brains out he would just die, and that would be it.
But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools.
This haunting business is even stranger than murder.
My worthy lord, your noble friends miss your company.
I forgot about them.
I drink to the happiness of everyone at the table, and to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.
I wish he were here!
Let’s drink to everyone here, and to Banquo.
Now, everybody, drink Hear, hear.
