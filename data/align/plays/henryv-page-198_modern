What does he say?
He begs you to spare his life.
He is a gentleman of a good family, and for his ransom, he will give you two hundred crowns.
Tell him my fury will abate, and Iâ€™ll take the crowns.
Explain, boy.
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one, as he thinks, who is the bravest, most valorous, and thrice-worthy gentleman of England.
As I get to leech him, I will show some mercy.
Follow me.
