I’ll try you on the shore.
And shall, sir.
Give ’s your hand.
O Antony, You have my father’s house.
But what?
We are friends.
Come, down into the boat.
Take heed you fall not.
Menas, I’ll not on shore.
No, to my cabin.
These drums, these trumpets, flutes!
What!
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell To these great fellows.
Sound and be hanged, sound out!
Hoo!
says ’a.
There’s my cap.
Hoo!
Noble captain, come.
