I’ll have the work ta'en out And give ’t Iago.
What he will do with it Heaven knows, not I. I nothing but to please his fantasy.
How now!
What do you here alone?
Do not you chide.
I have a thing for you.
A thing for me?
It is a common thing— Ha?
To have a foolish wife.
Oh, is that all?
What will you give me now For the same handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona, That which so often you did bid me steal.
Hast stolen it from her?
No, but she let it drop by negligence And, to th' advantage, I being here, took ’t up.
Look, here it is.
