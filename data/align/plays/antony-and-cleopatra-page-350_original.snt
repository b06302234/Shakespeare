A way there, a way for Caesar!
O sir, you are too sure an augurer.
That you did fear is done.
Bravest at the last, She leveled at our purposes and, being royal, Took her own way.
The manner of their deaths?
I do not see them bleed.
Who was last with them?
A simple countryman that brought her figs.
This was his basket.
Poisoned, then.
Oh, Caesar, This Charmian lived but now.
She stood and spake.
I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress.
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped.
Oh, noble weakness!
If they had swallowed poison, â€™twould appear By external swelling, but she looks like sleep, As she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of grace.
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood, and something blown.
The like is on her arm.
