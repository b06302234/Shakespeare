A sick man in sadness makes his will, A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good markman!
And she’s fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss.
She’ll not be hit With Cupid’s arrow.
She hath Dian’s wit.
And, in strong proof of chastity well armed From love’s weak childish bow, she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms, Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
Oh, she is rich in beauty, only poor That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty, starved with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me.
Forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
