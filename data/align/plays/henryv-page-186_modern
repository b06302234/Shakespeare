go by, from this day to the end of time, without our being remembered: we few, we happy few, we band of brothers—for whoever sheds his blood with me today shall be my brother.
However humble his birth, this day shall grant him nobility.
And men back in English now safe in their beds will curse themselves for not having been here, and think less of their own manhood when they listen to the stories of those who fought with us here on St. Crispin’s Day.
My sovereign lord, join us quickly: the French are all arrayed in battle formation and will charge us at any moment.
We’re ready if our minds are ready.
Let any man perish who isn’t ready now!
You don’t wish we had more help from England anymore, cousin?
God Almighty, my liege, I wish that you and I could fight this royal battle all alone.
