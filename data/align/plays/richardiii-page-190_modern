Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent— Look behind you!
Defend yourself!
There are enemies here.
God defend and guard us innocents against them!
Stay calm.
They’re friends—Ratcliffe and Lovell.
Here’s the head of that notorious traitor, the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
I loved this man so much it makes me weep.
I took him to be the plainest, most harmless Christian on earth.
He was the book in which I recorded all of my most secret thoughts.
He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn’t been for his love affair with Shore’s wife, I would never have suspected him.
Well, well, he was the most covert traitor who ever lived.
Would you believe, if we hadn’t caught him, this subtle traitor would have murdered the Lord of Gloucester and me in the council room today?
He would have?
