With Cassio?
That’s impossible.
Be quiet and listen to me.
Remember how she fell madly in love with the Moor because he bragged and told her made-up stories?
Did you expect her to keep on loving him for his chattering?
You’re too smart to think that.
No, she needs someone nice-looking.
Othello’s ugly, what pleasure could she find in him?
Lovemaking gets boring after a while.
To keep things hot, she’ll need to see someone with a handsome face, someone close to her in age, someone who looks and acts like her.
Othello isn’t any of those things.
Since he doesn’t have these advantages to make him attractive to her, she’ll get sick of him until he makes her want to puke.
She’ll start looking around for a second choice.
Now, if that’s true—and it’s obviously true—who’s in a better position than Cassio?
He’s a smooth talker, and uses sophistication and fine manners to hide his lust.
Nobody’s as crafty as he is.
Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for.
He’s a bad boy, and Desdemona’s got her eye on him already.
I can’t believe that.
She’s not that kind of woman.
She’s very moral.
Like hell she is!
She’s made of the same flesh and blood as everyone else.
If she were so moral, she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place.
Good lord!
Did you notice how she and Cassio were fondling each other’s hands?
Did you see that?
