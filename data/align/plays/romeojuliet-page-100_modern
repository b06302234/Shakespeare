Speak plainly, make your meaning clear, my son.
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution.
I love rich Capulet’s daughter.
I love her, and she loves me.
We’re bound to each other in every possible way, except we need you to marry us.
I’ll tell you more later about when and where we met, how we fell in love, and how we exchanged promises, but now I’m begging you: please, agree to marry us today.
Holy Saint Francis, this is a drastic change!
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline, whom you loved so much?
Then young men love with their eyes, not with their hearts.
Jesus and Mary, how many tears did you cry for Rosaline?
How many salty tear-drops did you waste salting a love you never tasted?
The sun hasn’t yet melted away the fog you made with all your sighs.
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears.
There’s still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn’t been washed off yet.
If you were ever yourself, and this sadness was yours, you and your sadness were all for Rosaline.
And now you’ve changed?
Then repeat this after me: you can’t expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable.
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline.
I scolded you for obsessing about her, not for loving her, my student.
And you told me to bury my love.
