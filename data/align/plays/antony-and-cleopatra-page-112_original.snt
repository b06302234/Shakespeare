Take your time.
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails.
We’ll speak with thee at sea.
At land, thou know’st How much we do o’ercount thee.
At land indeed Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house, But since the cuckoo builds not for himself, Remain in ’t as thou mayst.
Be pleased to tell us— For this is from the present—how you take The offers we have sent you.
There’s the point.
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh What it is worth embraced.
And what may follow, To try a larger fortune.
You have made me offer Of Sicily, Sardinia.
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates, then, to send Measures of wheat to Rome.
This ’greed upon To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted.
That’s our offer.
