the core, I kept Hamlet’s condition secret and let it grow more and more dangerous.
Where has he gone?
To remove the corpse of the man he killed.
His madness allows a glimmering of morality to shine through, like a vein of gold in a chunk of coal.
He weeps for what he has done.
Oh, Gertrude, let’s go.
As soon as the sun sets we’ll ship him off to England.
It’ll take all my diplomatic know-how to explain and excuse the murder he’s committed.
Hey, Guildenstern!
My friends, go find others to help you.
Hamlet in his madness has killed Polonius and dragged him out of his mother’s bedroom.
Go find him and speak nicely to him, and bring the corpse into the chapel.
Please hurry.
Come, Gertrude.
We’ll confer with our wisest friends and tell them what we’re going to do, and what terrible deed has been done already.
Let’s hope slander—a bullet that can travel halfway around the world and still hit its exact target—spares us.
Oh, we must go.
I’m full of confusion and despair.
