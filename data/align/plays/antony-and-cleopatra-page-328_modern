Don’t think I blame you.
Whatever injuries I received in the war, I put down to the fortunes of war.
You are now the sole lord of the entire world.
I can’t explain my cause very clearly.
I must admit to having the weaknesses that all women are accused of.
Cleopatra, understand that, rather than emphasize our power over you, we will soften if you accept our intentions, which are very compassionate toward you.
Your acceptance will benefit you, but if you try to make me look cruel by committing suicide as Antony did, I won’t be so generous.
Your children will be destroyed, a fate your submission will save them from.
I’ll leave you now.
You may do whatever you want in the world.
It’s yours, and you may hang us, your trophies of war, anywhere you like.
Here, my good lord.
