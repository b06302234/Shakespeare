It’s a strange snake.
It is that.
And its tears are wet.
What is it?
I’ve always had great respect for your destiny.
You’ve served me faithfully.
What else can I say?
Stay away from the quicksand of drink, Lepidus: you’re sinking.
What are you saying?
Would you like to be king of the entire world?
Now I’ve said it twice.
How could that happen?
Just consider it.
Though I seem poor, I am the man who will give you the world.
