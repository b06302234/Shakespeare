But what about Cicero?
Should we see what he thinks?
I think he will stand strong with us.
Let’s not leave him out.
No, by no means.
Yes, we should get his support, for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions.
They’ll assume that Cicero, with his sound judgment, ordered the actions.
His dignified maturity will distract attention from our youth and wildness.
No, don’t even mention him.
We shouldn’t tell him about our plans.
He’ll never follow anything that other men have started.
Then leave him out.
