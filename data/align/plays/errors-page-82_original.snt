You know since Pentecost the sum is due, And since I have not much importuned you, Nor now I had not, but that I am bound To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
Therefore make present satisfaction, Or I’ll attach you by this officer.
Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus.
And in the instant that I met with you, He had of me a chain.
At five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same.
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house, I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
That labor may you save.
See where he comes.
While I go to the goldsmith’s house, go thou And buy a rope’s end.
That will I bestow Among my wife and her confederates For locking me out of my doors by day.
But soft.
I see the goldsmith.
Get thee gone.
Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.
