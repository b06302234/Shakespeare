Oh, what a sad sight!
Oh, noble Caesar!
Oh, sad day!
Oh, traitors, villains!
Oh, most bloody sight!
We will get revenge.
Revenge!
Let’s go after them!
Seek!
Burn!
Set fire!
Kill!
Slay!
Leave no traitors alive!
Wait, countrymen.
Quiet there!
Listen to the noble Antony.
We’ll listen to him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him.
Good friends, sweet friends, don’t let me stir you up to such a sudden mutiny.
Those who have done this deed are honorable.
I don’t know what private grudges they had that made them do it.
They’re wise and honorable, and will no doubt give you reasons for it.
I haven’t come to steal your loyalty, friends.
I’m no orator, as Brutus is.
I’m only, as you know, a plain, blunt man who loved his friend, and the men who let me speak know this well.
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up.
I just speak directly.
I tell you what you already know.
I show you sweet Caesar’s wounds—poor, speechless mouths!—and make them speak for me.
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me, then I’d stir you up, and install in each of Caesar’s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny.
