Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines; the duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
To the mines?
Tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines, for, look you, the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war.
The concavities of it is not sufficient, for, look you, th' athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look you, is digt himself four yard under the countermines.
By Cheshu, I think he will plow up all if there is not better directions.
The duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.
It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
I think it be.
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world.
I will verify as much in his beard.
He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy dog.
Here he comes, and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.
