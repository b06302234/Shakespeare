If you won’t risk coming to see her tonight, then don’t claim to know what she’s like.
If you follow me, I’ll give you all the proof you need.
Once you have seen more and heard more, then you can decide what to do.
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her, I’ll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her.
And since I wooed her in your name, I’ll join you in disgracing her.
I won’t say anything else about her until you two see things for yourselves.
Remain calm until midnight, and then you’ll see what the trouble is.
Oh, this day has turned into a disaster!
Oh, mischief has ruined our plans!
Oh, a plague has been prevented, thank God!
That’s what you’ll say once you’ve seen part two.
