Away, Tybalt.
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses!
I am sped.
Is he gone and hath nothing?
What, art thou hurt?
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch.
Marry, ’tis enough.
Where is my page?—Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
Courage, man.
The hurt cannot be much.
No, ’tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door, but ’tis enough, ’twill serve.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.
I am peppered, I warrant, for this world.
A plague o' both your houses!
Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat to scratch a man to death!
A braggart, a rogue, a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic!
Why the devil came you between us?
I was hurt under your arm.
I thought all for the best.
