Which spongy April at thy hest betrims To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves, Whose shadow the dismissèd bachelor loves, Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipped vineyard; And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky hard, Where thou thyself dost air—the Queen o' th' Sky, Whose watery arch and messenger am I, Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace, Here on this grass plot, in this very place, To come and sport.
Her peacocks fly amain.
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
Hail, many-colored messenger, that ne'er Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter; Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers Diffusest honey drops, refreshing showers; And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown My bosky acres and my unshrubbed down, Rich scarf to my proud earth.
Why hath thy queen Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green?
A contract of true love to celebrate, And some donation freely to estate On the blessed lovers.
Tell me, heavenly bow, If Venus or her son, as thou dost know, Do now attend the queen?
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got, Her and her blind boy’s scandaled company I have forsworn.
