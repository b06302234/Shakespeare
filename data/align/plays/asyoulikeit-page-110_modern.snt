You’re going to rest while you’re still damned?
God help you, foolish man.
Pray God does some surgery on you: you need to be fixed.
Sir, I’m a true, simple laborer: I earn what I eat, get what I wear, hate no man, envy no man’s happiness, am happy for other men’s good fortune and satisfied with my own bad fortune, and the source of my greatest pride is watching my ewes graze and my lambs feed.
That’s another sin arising from your ignorance: you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation.
You act as a pimp to a young ewe by forcing her to have sex with a crooked-headed, horny old ram—a totally unreasonable match.
If you’re not damned for that, then the devil must be keeping shepherds out of hell; I can’t see how else you can hope to escape.
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.
There is no jewel like Rosalind.
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world, carrying the name of Rosalind.
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind.
Don’t think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind.
