My lord, please go inside here.
Go inside yourself.
Make yourself comfortable.
This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more.
But I’ll go in.
Poor homeless creatures suffering this storm, wherever you are, how will you survive a night like this with no roof over your heads, no fat on your sides to keep you warm, and only rags for clothes?
When I was king I didn’t do enough to help you.
Powerful men, take your medicine by learning about hardship.
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel.
Then you can give them your extra wealth and make the world more fair.
Don’t come in here, uncle!
There’s a spirit in here!
Help me, help me!
Give me your hand.
Who’s there?
A ghost, a ghost!
He says his name’s Poor Tom.
Who are you, moaning in the hut like that?
Come out.
