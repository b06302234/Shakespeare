You gave me none.
You wrong me much to say so.
You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
Consider how it stands upon my credit.
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
I do,  This touches me in reputation.
Either consent to pay this sum for me, Or I attach you by this officer.
Consent to pay thee that I never had?— Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.
Here is thy fee.
Arrest him, officer.
I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently.
I do arrest you, sir.
You hear the suit.
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer.
Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus, To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
