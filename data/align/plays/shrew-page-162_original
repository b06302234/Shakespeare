Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
Peter, didst ever see the like?
He kills her in her own humor.
Where is he?
In her chamber, Making a sermon of continency to her, And rails and swears and rates, that she, poor soul, Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak, And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away, for he is coming hither!
Thus have I politicly begun my reign, And ’tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty, And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged, For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard, To make her come and know her keeper’s call.
