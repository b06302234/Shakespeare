What’s going on, Rosalind?
Cupid have mercy!
You won’t utter a single word?
I don’t even have one to throw at a dog.
No, your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs.
Throw some of your words at me.
Come on, throw your words at me like you would throw stones at a dog.
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed: one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any.
Is all of this about your father?
No, some of it is about my child’s father.
Oh, this  They’re only burrs, cousin, thrown at you because you took a holiday from conventional behavior.
If we walk on the well-worn paths, they won’t get caught in our petticoats.
Those burrs I could shake off my clothing, but these are in my heart.
Cough them up.
I’d try it, if I could cry “hem” and have him.
Come on, take control of your feelings.
