O bind him, bind him!
Let him not come near me.
More company!
The fiend is strong within him.
Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
What, will you murder me?—Thou jailer, thou, I am thy prisoner.
Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue?
Masters, let him go.
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
Go, bind this man, for he is frantic too.
What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
He is my prisoner.
If I let him go, The debt he owes will be required of me.
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee.
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor, And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.— Good Master Doctor, see him safe conveyed Home to my house.
O most unhappy day!
