This is the air, that’s the glorious sun.
I can feel and see this pearl she gave me.
I may be dazed and confused, but I’m not insane.
Where’s Antonio, then?
I didn’t find him at the Elephant.
But he’d been there before me, and they told me he’d gone out looking for me.
I could really use his advice right now.
I feel sure this situation is due to some mistake, and I don’t think I’m crazy.
But this sudden flood of good luck is so unbelievable that I’m ready to distrust my own eyes and my own rational mind when they tell me I’m not insane—maybe the lady’s insane.
But if that were the case, she wouldn’t be able to run her house, command her servants, listen to reports, make decisions, and take care of business as smoothly as she does.
There’s something going on that’s not what it seems.
But here she comes.
