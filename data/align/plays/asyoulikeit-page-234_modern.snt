Good duke, come receive your daughter.
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes, brought her here.
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my daughter.
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my Rosalind.
If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, goodbye, love.
Quiet!
Stop chattering until I’ve made everything clear.
There are eight people here that I will join in marriage, if the truth you see before you pleases you.
