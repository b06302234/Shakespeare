Ah, for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
What stay had I but Edward?
And he’s gone.
What stay had we but Clarence?
And he’s gone.
What stays had I but they?
And they are gone.
Was never widow had so dear a loss.
Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
Was never mother had so dear a loss.
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.
Their woes are parceled; mine are general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I; I for a Clarence weep; so doth not she.
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I; I for an Edward weep; so do not they.
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distressed, Pour all your tears.
I am your sorrow’s nurse, And I will pamper it with lamentations.
