I swear, there’s a rumor going around that you’ll marry her.
You’re kidding!
If it’s not true, you can call me a villain.
Have you given me bastard children to raise?
All right, then.
The little monkey must have started that rumor herself.
She thinks I’ll marry her because she loves me.
She’s just flattering herself.
I never promised her anything.
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer.
Now he’s telling the story.
She was here just now.
She hangs around me all the time.
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore, and the fool showed up.
I swear to you, she put her arms around me like this— Saying, “Oh, Cassio,” it seems, judging by his gestures.
She hangs around me and dangles from my neck and cries, shaking me and pulling at me.
Ha, ha, ha!
Now he’s saying how she took him into our bedroom.
Oh, I can see your nose now.
But I can’t see the dog I’m going to throw it to.
I have to get rid of her.
Look out, here she comes.
