What, no more?
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond!
Double six thousand, and then treble that, Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.
First go with me to church and call me wife, And then away to Venice to your friend.
For never shall you lie by Portia’s side With an unquiet soul.
You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over.
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows.
Come, away!
For you shall hence upon your wedding day.
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer.
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.
Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried.
My creditors grow cruel.
My estate is very low.
My bond to the Jew is forfeit.
And since in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are cleared between you and I if I might but see you at my death.
Notwithstanding, use your pleasure.
If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.” O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste.
But till I come again, No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay, No rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.
