Oh, look, Titinius, look!
Those villains, our soldiers, flee!
I’ve become an enemy to my own soldiers!
This standard-bearer here of mine was running away, so I killed him and took the flag from him.
Oh, Cassius, Brutus gave the orders too soon.
Having an advantage over Octavius, he took it too eagerly, and his soldiers began looting, and now we’re surrounded by Antony’s men.
Retreat further, my lord, retreat further.
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.
Therefore you must run, noble Cassius.
This hill is far enough.
Look, look, Titinius.
Are those my tents on fire?
They are, my lord.
Titinius, if you love me, get on your horse and spur him on until he’s brought you to those troops and back again, so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies.
