O Lord!
No way but gentleness, gently, gently.
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.
Sir!
Ay, Biddy, come with me.â€”What, man!
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan.
Hang him, foul collier!
Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
My prayers, minx?
Go, hang yourselves all!
You are idle, shallow things.
I am not of your element.
You shall know more hereafter.
