Get to the point now.
I’ll let you get away with skipping the praise.
That’s too bad, because I spent a long time memorizing it, and it’s poetic.
That means it’s more likely to be fake.
Please, keep it to yourself.
I heard you were rude when you were standing outside my gate, and that’s the only reason I let you in.
I was curious.
But I don’t necessarily want to listen to you.
If you’re just insane, then get out of here.
If you’re in your right mind, get to the point.
I’ve got no patience for lunacy at the moment, and I don’t want to waste my time on ridiculous conversations.
Ready to set sail, sir?
The door’s right here.
No, this boat’s docking here a bit longer, little sailor.—My lady, would you mind asking your giant here to back off a bit?
Tell me what you want.
I have a message to deliver.
It must be a message about something horrible, since you deliver it so rudely.
Tell me what it’s about.
It’s about you.
I’m not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash.
I’m coming in peace.
But you began so rudely.
Who are you?
What do you want?
