It is, it is.
Get out of here, be gone, go away!
It’s the lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise.
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night.
It’s not true because she separates us.
More and more light.
More and more pain for us.
Madam.
Nurse?
Your mother is coming to your bedroom.
Day has broken.
Be careful.
Watch out.
Then the window lets day in, and life goes out the window.
Farewell, farewell!
Give me one kiss, and I’ll go down.
