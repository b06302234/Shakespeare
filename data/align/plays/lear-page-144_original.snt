Sir, I do know you, And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you.
There is division, Although as yet the face of it be covered With mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall, Who have—as who have not that their great stars Throned and set high?—servants, who seem no less, Which are to France the spies and speculations Intelligent of our state.
What hath been seen, Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes, Or the hard rein which both of them hath borne Against the old kind king, or something deeper, Whereof perchance these are but furnishings— But true it is.
From France there comes a power Into this scattered kingdom, who already, Wise in our negligence, have secret feet In some of our best ports and are at point To show their open banner.
Now to you.
If on my credit you dare build so far To make your speed to Dover, you shall find Some that will thank you, making just report Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow The king hath cause to plain.
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding, And from some knowledge and assurance offer This office to you.
I will talk further with you.
