If I’m not mistaken, that’s Portia’s voice.
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo—by its bad voice.
Dear lady, welcome home.
We’ve been praying for our husbands' welfare.
We hope they’re better off because of our prayers.
Have they come back?
No, ma'am, they haven’t.
But a messenger came ahead to tell us they were on their way.
Go inside, Nerissa.
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone.
You must not, either, Lorenzo—or you, Jessica.
