Wherefore?
For my dinner.
I have not dined today.
What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe?
O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my name!
The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place, Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name, or thy name   for an ass.
Let my master in, Luce.
And so tell your master.
O Lord, I must laugh.
Have at you with a proverb: shall I set in my staff?
