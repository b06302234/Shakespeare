Sirrah, lead these gentlemen To my daughters, and tell them both These are their tutors.
Bid them use them well.
We will go walk a little in the orchard, And then to dinner.
You are passing welcome, And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste, And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my father well, and in him me, Left solely heir to all his lands and goods, Which I have bettered rather than decreased.
Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love, What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
After my death, the one half of my lands, And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
And, for that dowry, I’ll assure her of Her widowhood, be it that she survive me, In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, That covenants may be kept on either hand.
Ay, when the special thing is well obtained, That is, her love, for that is all in all.
Why, that is nothing.
For I tell you, father, I am as peremptory as she proud-minded; And where two raging fires meet together, They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
Though little fire grows great with little wind, Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.
So I to her and so she yields to me, For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
