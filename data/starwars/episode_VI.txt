    [Darth Vader steps out of his shuttle on the Death Star.]
    Moff Jerjerrod: Lord Vader. This is an unexpected pleasure. We are honored by your presence.
    Darth Vader: You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I am here to put you back on schedule.
    Jerjerrod: I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast they can.
    Vader: Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
    Jerjerrod: I tell you that this station will be operational as planned.
    Vader: The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
    Jerjerrod: But he asks the impossible! I need more men!
    Vader: Then perhaps you can tell him yourself when he arrives.
    Jerjerrod: [alarmed] The Emperor's coming here?
    Vader: That is correct, Commander, and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
    Jerjerrod: We shall double our efforts.
    Vader: I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

    [Jabba the Hutt and his entourage catch Leia rescuing Han]
    Han Solo: Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked! It's not my fault...
    Jabba the Hutt: [in Huttese] It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler in the business, but now you're Bantha fodder!
    Solo: Look...
    Jabba: [to guards] Take him away!
    Solo: [being dragged away by the guards] Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here! Don't be a fool!
    [Lando attempts to lead Leia away]
    Jabba: Wait! Bring her to me.
    [Leia is forced towards Jabba]
    Princess Leia Organa: We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this.
    Jabba: [grinning] Of that, I'm sure. But, in the meantime...

    [Emperor Palpatine has arrived on the Death Star.]
    Emperor Palpatine: [to a kneeling Vader] Rise, my friend.
    Darth Vader: The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
    Palpatine: You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
    Vader: Yes, my Master.
    Palpatine: Patience, my friend. In time, he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
    Vader: As you wish.
    Palpatine: Everything is proceeding as I have forseen. [laughs cruelly]

    [Luke is in Yoda's hut. Yoda is pacing back and forth. Luke is looking at him with a mixture of sadness and pity.]
    Yoda: That face, you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
    Luke: [hurriedly] No! Of course not.
    Yoda: [chuckles good-naturedly] I do. Yes, I do. Hmm, sick, have I become. Old and weak. [Points at Luke] When 900 years old, you reach, look as good, you will not, hmm? [Laughs again, coughs, walks over to his bed]. Soon, will I rest, yes. Forever sleep. Earned it, I have. [Climbs into his bed]
    Luke: Master Yoda, you can't die.
    Yoda: Strong, am I with the Force...but not that strong. Twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall. That is the way of things...the way of the Force.
    Luke: But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
    Yoda: No more training, do you require. Already know you that which you need.
    Luke: Then I am a Jedi.
    Yoda: [coughs, it grows harder for him to speak] Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must...confront...Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi, will you be. And confront him, you will.
    Luke: [visibly in agony] Master Yoda...is Darth Vader my father?
    Yoda: [turns away from Luke] Rest I need. Yes, rest.
    Luke: [pleading] Yoda, I must know.
    Yoda: Your father, he is. [Luke looks away] Told you, did he?
    Luke: Yes.
    Yoda: Unexpected, this is, and unfortunate.
    Luke: [surprised] Unfortunate that I know the truth?
    Yoda: No. [turns to face Luke] Unfortunate that you rushed to face him. That incomplete, was your training. That not ready for the burden, were you.
    Luke: I'm sorry.
    Yoda: [It takes him great effort to speak; his voice gradually grows softer] Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware: Anger, fear, aggression - the dark side, are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. [Whispering now] Luke...Luke...do not... [Struggles to speak] Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor...or suffer your father's fate you will. Luke...[Luke leans in close]...when gone am I, the last of the Jedi, will you be. Luke...the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned. Luke...[with great effort]...There...is...another...Sk...Sky...walker...[Yoda dies]

    [Yoda has passed into The Force, Luke is sitting outside his hut with R2]
    Luke: I can't do it, R2. I can't go on alone.
    Obi-Wan Kenobi: [voice emanates from nowhere] Yoda will always be with you. [reveals himself as a spirit walking nearby]
    Luke: Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
    Obi-Wan: Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I told you was true, from a certain point of view.
    Luke: [incredulously] A certain point of view?
    Obi-Wan: Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong.
    Luke: There is still good in him.
    Obi-Wan: He's more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
    Luke: I can't do it, Ben.
    Obi-Wan: You cannot escape your destiny. You must face Darth Vader again.
    Luke: I can't kill my own father!
    Obi-Wan: [resigned] Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
    Luke: Yoda spoke of another.
    Obi-Wan: The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
    Luke: But I have no sister.
    Obi-Wan: [nods] Mm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did. If Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
    Luke: [with sudden realization] Leia! Leia's my sister!
    Obi-Wan: Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit, but they could be made to serve the Emperor.

    [Luke has stepped out of the Ewok party. Leia joins him.]
    Princess Leia Organa: Luke, what's wrong?
    Luke: Leia, do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
    Leia: Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
    Luke: What do you remember?
    Leia: Just images, really. Feelings.
    Luke: Tell me.
    Leia: She was very beautiful. Kind, but sad. Why are you asking me all this?
    Luke: I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
    Leia: Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
    Luke: Vader's here. Now, on this moon.
    Leia: How do you know?
    Luke: I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him.
    Leia: Why?
    Luke: He's my father.
    Leia: [disgusted] Your father?!
    Luke: There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
    Leia: Luke, don't talk that way! You have a power I don't understand and could never have.
    Luke: You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it and... [looks directly at Leia] My sister has it. [waits for the words to sink in] Yes. It's you, Leia.
    Leia: [astonished] I know. Somehow, I've always known.
    Luke: Then you know why I have to face him.
    Leia: No! Luke, run away, far away! If he can feel your presence, then leave this place! I wish I could go with you.
    Luke: No, you don't. You've always been strong.
    Leia: But why must you confront him?
    Luke: Because there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. [kisses Leia on the cheek, then leaves. Han approaches Leia.]
    Han: Hey, what's goin' on?
    Leia: Nothing. I just want to be alone for a little while.
    Han: Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on?
    Leia: [distressed] I... I can't tell you!
    Han: [angrily] What, could you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
    Leia: [crying] Iâ€” [turns away from Han]
    Han: [grunts angrily and starts to storm away, but stops and returns to Leia a moment later] I'm sorry.
    Leia: [leaning against Han] Hold me.

    [Luke surrenders himself to Darth Vader.]
    Vader: The Emperor has been expecting you.
    Luke: I know, father.
    Vader: So, you have accepted the truth.
    Luke: I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.
    Vader: That name no longer has any meaning for me.
    Luke: It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. [steps off to the side of the passageway, away from Vader] That was why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
    Vader: [inspects Luke's lightsaber] I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. [turns off the lightsaber again] Indeed you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.
    Luke: Come with me.
    Vader: Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side! I must obey my master.
    Luke: I will not turn. And you'll be forced to kill me.
    Vader: If that is your destiny.
    Luke: Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you! Let go of your hate!
    Vader: It is... too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
    Luke: [resigned] Then my father is truly dead.

    Palpatine: Welcome, young Skywalker, I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. [uses the Force to detach Luke's cuffs] Guards, leave us. [the Emperor's guards leave the room] I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time, you will call me master.
    Luke: You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.
    Palpatine: Oh no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken. About a great many things.
    Darth Vader: [hands Luke's lightsaber to Palpatine] His lightsaber.
    Palpatine: Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon, much like your father's. By now you must know that your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.
    Luke: You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead, and you with me.
    Palpatine: [laughing] Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet? Yes, I assure you, we are quite safe from your friends here.
    Luke: Your overconfidence is your weakness.
    The Emperor: Your faith in your friends is yours.
    Vader: It is pointless to resist, my son.
    Palpatine: Everything that has transpired has done so, according to my design. Your friends, out there on the sanctuary moon, are walking into a trap, as is your Rebel fleet. It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. [mockingly] Oh, I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

    Vader: [searching for Luke in Palpatine's chamber] You cannot hide forever, Luke.
    Luke: I will not fight you.
    Vader: Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... [pauses] Sister! So, you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will!
    Luke: [revealing himself] NEVER!
    [Luke attacks Vader ferociously, eventually backing him onto a railing and cutting off his arm. He stands over Vader for a moment.]
    Palpatine: [laughing] Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!
    Luke: [Notices Vader's detached hand is bionic, like his own, has a realization, then turns to face the Emperor, throwing away his lightsaber] Never. I'll never turn to the Dark Side. You have failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.
    Palpatine: [angrily] So be it... Jedi!

    [Luke refuses to give in to Palpatine's demands and disarms himself.]
    Palpatine: [raising his hands toward Luke] If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed!
    [Lightning shoots out of Palpatine's fingers and strikes Luke, causing him to fall to the floor in agony. Darth Vader gets up and stands next to Palpatine, watching.]
    Palpatine: Young fool. Only now, at the end, do you understand. [shoots another round of lightning into Luke] Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the Dark Side! You have paid the price for your lack of vision! [continues shooting lightning at Luke]
    Luke: [writhing in agony] Father, please! Help me!
    Palpatine: Now, young Skywalker... you will die. [blasts more and more lightning at Luke; Darth Vader looks back and forth at Luke and Palpatine.]
    Darth Vader: No. NOOOOOO!!
    [Eventually, Vader grabs Palpatine from behind and throws him down into the reactor shaft]

    [A redeemed Anakin Skywalker is dying in Luke's arms]
    Anakin Skywalker: Luke, help me take this mask off.
    Luke: But you'll die!
    Anakin: Nothing can stop that now. Just for once, let me look on you with my own eyes. [Luke carefully removes Vader's mask to reveal Anakin's disfigured face underneath.] Now...go, my son. Leave me.
    Luke: No, you're coming with me. I won't leave you here. I've got to save you!
    Anakin: [smiles] You already have, Luke. You were right. You were right about me... Tell your sister... you were right... [dies]
    Luke: Father... I won't leave you.
