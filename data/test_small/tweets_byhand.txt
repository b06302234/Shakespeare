I just want to get all the way wasted tonight.
I love her too. I hope my mom gets pit tomorrow! I probably have to get my tickets in the afternoon though.
More snow on friday and saturday ? Really ?
If God did a random inspection of your life today , would you be able to pass ?
I hope you enjoyed the wood chairs and wood decorations. lovely to hang with you and our gang tonight in the woods
Just saw homeless disheveled man at McDonalds 1st reaction was to ignore , then remembered that 's also the face of God . Things changed .
Trying new stuff for dinner tonight so I will devote some time to my kitchen and then watch Red while eating .	
Very happy today !! Its almost the weekend and to make my day even better got a brand new cell phone.
Someone peed in the lift last night or early morning .
Looking forward to sharing ideas ! Have a great night .
