We thank all the reviewers for their thoughtful and detailed comments.  Responses to selected points from each review are listed below:

Reviewer 1:
Thanks for the pointers to survey papers on paraphrasing, these do seem be more appropriate to cite in the introduction as a useful pointer for readers not already familiar with the previous work.

Good suggestion on clarifying our use of the term style.  We will add some comments to make clearer the fact that the language is different both because it comes from an author with a distinctive style and also because it is an earlier form of English.

Reviewer 2:
Great suggestions, we will add more details describing the system, and some analysis of common errors.

We will also try to re-arrange the figures to better match the location of their reference in the text.

Reviewer 3:
It is true that phrase-based statistical machine translation uses a very simple model which learns both syntactic and semantic transformations to an input string
based on phrase pairs.  Future work could investigate the use of syntactic analysis in stylistic paraphrase which may be able to learn more non-local transformations to the input and thus
perform better, however as this is the first work to investigate paraphrase for writing style, we felt it was best to start by exploring simpler models.

Standard evaluation metrics don't capture the notion of writing style, for example BLEU seems to confuse semantic adequacy with writing style.  We believe it would be beneficial 
to have access to metrics which can separate these two criteria when evaluating paraphrases targeting a specific style of writing.
