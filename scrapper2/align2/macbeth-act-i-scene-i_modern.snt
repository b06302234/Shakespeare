When should the three of us meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
When all the uproar is over, When the battle has been lost and won.
That will be before sunset.
Where should we meet?
Upon the heath.
That’s where we’ll meet with Macbeth.
I’m coming, you old she-cat!
The old toad is calling me.
In a minute!
Beautiful is disgustingly filthy, and disgustingly filthy is beautiful.
Let’s float through the fog and filthy air.
