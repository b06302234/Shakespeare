Now that weâ€™re near enough, throw the branch down, And look like the men you are.
You, worthy uncle, Shall lead our first battle with my cousin, Your right-noble son, Worthy Macduff and we Shall take upon us what ever is left to do, According to our order.
Fare you well.
If we only find the tyrant's forces tonight, Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
Blow all our trumpets.
Blow them all, Those noisy announcers of blood and death.
