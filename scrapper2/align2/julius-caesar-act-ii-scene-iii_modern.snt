Caesar, beware of Brutus; be careful of Cassius; don’t come near Casca; watch Cinna; don’t trust Trebonius; pay attention to Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus doesn’t love you; you’ve sinned against Caius Ligarius.
There is only one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar.
If you’re not immortal, look around you.
Security gives way to conspiracy.
The mighty gods defend you!
Your lover, Artemidorus.
Here I’ll stand here until Caesar passes along, And as a petitioner, I will give him this note.
My heart is sad that virtue can’t live Out of the teeth of emulation.— If you read this, O Caesar, you may live; If not, the Fates are working against you.
