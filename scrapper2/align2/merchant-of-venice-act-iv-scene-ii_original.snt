Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed, And let him sign it; we'll away to-night, And be a day before our husbands home.
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en: My Lord Bassanio, upon more advice, Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat Your company at dinner.
That cannot be: His ring I do accept most thankfully, And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore, I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.
That will I do.
Sir, I would speak with you:â€” I'll see if I can get my husband's ring, Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
Thou may'st, I warrant we shall have old swearing, That they did give the rings away to men; But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
Away!
make haste; thou know'st where I will tarry.
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
