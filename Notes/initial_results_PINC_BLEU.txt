We gathered more parallel data from another website (www.enotes.com)
which has modern translations of 8 plays (the previous source,
www.sparknotes.com has 17).  This gives us multiple translations in
the Shakespeare->modern direction.  Shakespeare wrote a total of 37
plays. We held out Romeo & Juliet for dev and test and computed some
BLEU scores below.  Also note that we're only evaluating in the
modern-> Shakespeare direction currently, but arguably the other
direction might be better motivated since many of the plays don't
appear to have modern translations.

First of all, note that the enotes.com translations are very close to
the original text, whereas the sparknotes ones tend to contain more
paraphrases.  Evaluating the basline of simply not translating the
input at all gives the following BLEU scores:
SparkNotes: 24.67
Enotes: 52.30

By training on 16 plays from sparknotes, and 7 plays from enotes, in
addition to using 36 plays (besides R&J) for the language model, we
get a decent improvement over this baseline:
SparkNotes: 28.25
Enotes: 54.44

Only using 16 plays for the language model:
SparkNotes: BLEU 28.24; PINC 35.10 (mert PINC 26.58)
Enotes: BLEU 54.26; PINC 25.82 (mert PINC 18.54)

And only using the 16 plays from Sparknotes for the translation model
(but still using 36 for the LM):
Sparknotes: 28.40
Enotes: 52.94

Also we implemented a simple version of the Dictionary baseline which
uses the (word to word) dictionary as a phrase table combined with the
36 plays LM. The word translation probabilities were simply calculated
according to their frequencies in all Shakespearean plays (the
baseline method MF used by Koehn&Knight's paper).  It does propose a
few good paraphrases, but it doesn't beat the baseline of just piping
in the original text:
Basline1 - 2k dictionary
Sparknotes: 23.67
Enotes: 49.60
Basline2 - 20k dictionary
Sparknotes: 21.38
Enotes: 41.26
