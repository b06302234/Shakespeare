I am not a villain.
Give it to me!
What, shall I groan and tell you?
She's dead, pitiful day!
He was not born to shame.
If I may trust what happens while I sleep, My dreams predict some joyful news is coming.
Either you or I, or both of us, must go with him.
There lies the man slain by young Romeo, That killed your kinsman, brave Mercutio.
How are you out of breath, when you have breath To say to me that you are out of breath?
O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
Come, vial.
And to what?
I am very happy he wasn’t at this fight.
I wish the foolish girl were married to her grave!
No better?
Help me into some house, Benvolio, Or I shall faint.
His love is blind and it suits the dark best.
I am finished.
Yes, my own fortune in my misery.
For doting, not for loving, my pupil.
O love!
Welcome from Mantua.
I will bite you on the ear for that joke!
Welcome, gentlemen!
Hold the friar too.
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
Is he gone, and he has nothing?
Can’t someone speak?
By Mary, sir, because silver has a sweet sound.
Let them take it whatever way they will.
Romeo will answer it.
I must act my dreadful scene alone.
Madam, I am here.
Now, before God, I am so annoyed that every part about me quivers.
As I was sleeping under this yew tree here, I dreamed that my master and another fought, And that my master killed him.
Good morning, cousin Is it morning?
Romeo can, Though heaven cannot.
What devil are you that torments me like this?
So, I die with a kiss.
Take some new infection to your eye, And the rank poison of the old love will die.
I won’t any hooked instruments.
I wish I were your bird.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Did a dragon ever keep so beautiful a cave?
Don’t you letters to me from the friar?
Peter, stay at the gate.
Go tell him about this.
Faith, I don’t know what to say.
I’ll go call the guards.
What are we going to give as our excuse?
Give me my sin again.
Who is her mother?
I will confess to you that I love him.
Young son, it is arguably a distempered head that Bids good morning so soon to your bed.
Some twenty of them fought in this black fight, And all those twenty could only take one life.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder happened.
A man, young lady!
If love is blind, love can’t find the spot.
Perhaps you have learned it without book.
Tybalt, my cousin!
Where the devil can this Romeo be?
As I remember, this should be the house.
You are too hot under the collar.
Shame come to Romeo!
Tell me, good my friend, What torch is over there that wastes giving his light To grubs and eyeless skulls?
Who is calling so loudly?
Every one should prepare To follow this beautiful corpse to her grave.
O woe!
Now he is for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in!
Is it so?
That’s very soon.
Only to be honest and give it to you again.
Where is my mother?
Monday!
To supper; to our house.
What have you found?
Good evening to my ghostly confessor.
Will you go to them?
You can’t speak about something you don’t feel.
Can I go home when my heart is here?
Look, sir, here the lady is coming toward my cell.
Yes, madam, from the reach of my hands.
What’s the matter?
A right fair mark, fair coz, is the first hit.
No, not until Thursday.
As much to him, otherwise his thanks is too much.
Peace, you mumbling fool!
By a name that I don’t know how to tell you who I am.
Tell me, daughter Juliet, What do you think about getting married?
You were never with me for anything when you were not there for the goose.
Or shall we just go on without any apology?
Romeo, leave, be gone!
Pitiful sight!
What, will you wash him from his grave with tears?
By my heel, I care not.
Couldn’t you take some opportunity without my giving you one?
It is he, that villain, Romeo.
Do you need my help?
O me, O me!
come, what does Romeo say?
His son was but a ward two years ago.
Nurse!
You take that.
What, lamb!
What, hello!
But now, my lord, what say you to my request?
We’re talking here in a public place.
In love?
Without his fish eggs, like a dried herring.
O Romeo, Romeo!
You’re a liar!
Have a nice day!
I don’t know and he won’t tell me.
No, my good lord.
The inherited estate!
What does Romeo say?
Saint Francis be my speed!
Good Romeo, hide yourself.
What false impression did I give you?
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse name.
Father, what news?
It’s not morning yet.
So will you confess, I am sure, that you love me.
Why, Bride!
Have you told her what we have decided for her?
A challenge, on my life.
Well, peace be with you, sir.
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
You will not move one foot to fight!
What, are you hurt?
See how she comes from confession with a happy face.
The, who took my letter to Romeo?
Her chaste, white gown is only sick and green, And only fools wear it.
It’s late.
Don’t you see that I’m out of breath?
Go, do what I have told you.
If you make us musicians, look to hear nothing but noise.
Isn’t she proud?
O heavy day!
Don’t deny to him that you love me.
How can watch them?
The boy gives the warning something is approaching.
Why, may one ask?
but whatever sorrow can come, It cannot equal the exchange of joy That one short minute in her sight gives me.
God mark you for his grace!
Do so, and bid my sweet to prepare to scold me.
No, cousin, I'd rather cry.
She will give him a written invitation to some supper.
Commend me to your daughter.
Don’t you bring me letters from the friar?
Good morning to you both.
Hurry up, make haste, for it grows very late.
From this time forward, do your messages yourself.
Will you still provoke me?
Where should they come?
Yes, boy, ready.
O heaven!
What, you’re dressed!
A full half hour.
Ready to go, but never to return.
Don’t worry about me.
How should they, when wise men have no eyes?
Throw her out, the good for nothing!
They’re asking for dates and quinces in the pastry.
O lamentable day!
I’ll ask that again; For nothing can be wrong if she is well.
Shame on you!
I’ll be waiting, A thousand times good night!
What can he say about this?
They wash his wounds with tears.
Up.
by my count I was your mother pretty close to the age That you are now.
What’s going on?
O flesh, flesh, how are you fishified!
I beg you, sir, have patience.
Are you a man?
If I were so easy to quarrel as you are, any man should buy the inherited estate of my life for an hour and a quarter.
I hear some noise.
Fight, sir!
You go to Juliet, help her ready.
Well, think of marriage now.
Yes, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
O rude unthankfulness!
This way you show me friendship.
He is wise; And, on my life, he has stolen home to bed.
Who knocks so hard?
Yes, she really did.
if you will just look sweet, Then I am protected against their hate.
I hear some noise within.
what, do you make us musicians?
Come here, man.
Am I like such a fellow?
Yes, yes, the ropes.
I’ll go, sir, and not trouble you.
What additional sorrow conspires against my old age?
Whose house?
No, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Blessings on you!
Answer me like men.
God in heaven bless her!
I know well where he is.
Down with the Montagues!
How long has he been in there?
No matter.
Do you love me?
O deadly sin!
the all-seeing sun Never saw anything to match her since the world first began.
And still I wish but for the thing that I already have.
I don’t know.
Farewell!
Answer that.
Send your man away.
Give me some comfort, nurse.
This is great.
Was there ever a book containing such vile matter So beautifully bound?
Why do you storm so?
Now God in heaven bless you!
You may call me that, sir, when I may be a wife.
Madam!
It was.
Go with me to the tomb.
Your mother.
What do you say?
Down with the Capulets!
Who is it?
Good day.—Please tell me, sir, can you read?
Amen!
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
Farewell, my coz.
why, she’s inside.
Or, if he wrote his mind, give me his letter.
to Romeo] Why the devil did you come between us?
You don’t understand me.
Therefore, he that cannot lick his fingers won’t come back with me.
Who now owes the price of his dear blood?
Where is my Romeo?
Listen, sir.
Have you met with him?
This is news indeed!
a madness most discreet, A choking acid, and a preserving sweet.
Where is she?
My fan, Peter.
I’ll go along.
No, sir.
Come on, let’s get going!
She speaks, but she says nothing.
Ah me!
Your plantain-leaf is excellent for that.
Will you tell me that?
But what do say you to Thursday?
This is the voice of Friar John.
Do what you want to do, because I’m finished with you.
Wait, Tybalt, wait!
But I should kill you with much cherishing.
Let me stand here until you remember.
I will be brief, for I don’t have enough breath to This tedious tale.
Let me argue with you about your situation.
Did he say it?
Take it any way you like.
Yeah, by my truth, the case may be amended.
The hell with him, Jack!
Nurse?
Good heart, at what?
Can your man keep a secret?
What?
The prince will sentence you to death If you are taken prisoner.
The what?
I will say it for you.
Now you know why we’re in a hurry.
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining to sing horrible songs and unpleasing notes.
You are a saucy boy.
I remember well where I should be, And here I am.
An eagle, madam, Is not as green, as quick, and hasn’t so beautiful an eye As Paris has.
Very bad luck!
I’m not proud that you have, but I’m thankful that you have.
What else is it?
You lie there.
No.
Well, sir.
How fares my Juliet?
Thus, then, here it is; The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
A right good marksman!
Monday, my lord.
Did you speak of Juliet?
Talk no more.
My dear son is Too familiar with such sour company.
What, is your sword out among these stupid servants?
Where should she be?
Good morning, gentlemen.
You shall find me easy enough for that, sir, if you will give me the opportunity.
Stand up.
Stay, then.
Good night, good night!
How is it with her?
O how honest!
Why, isn’t this better now than groaning for love?
You listen: your Romeo will be here at night.
Has Romeo killed himself?
On Thursday, sir?
Your part in her you could not keep from death, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
Hurry up, for fear my sword will be about your ears before you get yours out.
What, are you busy, hello?
And so did I.
And trust me, love, in my eyes, so do you.
Out, you bag of garbage!
Give me your hand.
What’s going on?
Was that my father that went away so fast?
How is my lady doing?
Clubs, pikes, and more pikes!
O me!
What is this?
This fight shall determine that.
There lies that same Tybalt.
For I never saw true beauty till this night.
I have forgotten why I called you back.
The citizens are up, and Tybalt is dead.
No, if there were two such fellows, we should have none shortly, because one would kill the other.
Yes, noise?
You’ll feel the loss, but not the loss of the friend You weep for.
Are you going?
I was hurt under your arm.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
Don’t saints and holy pilgrims have lips too?
The other one didn’t.
I know not, sir.
Your houses!
O, teach me how I should forget to think.
Why are you wringing your hands?
Madam, I am not well.
It makes me angry.
She lies the same way, Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Otherwise, you would have made your tale large.
O, go away!
Hurry to your chamber.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
Maybe she can’t meet him.
I have.
Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it from you.
Fight me, coward!
Let me weep for feeling such a loss.
It’s out already!
Wife!
And why are you butting in, my lady wisdom?
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Yes, the heads of maids, or their virginity.
Can’t you rest awhile?
We are ruined, lady, we are ruined!
I beg you, youth, Don’t put another sin on my head By urging me to fight.
I will kiss your lips.
Why, love?
At nine.
You don’t know what you’re doing!
Nurse, commend me to your lady and mistress.
Younger girls than she are made happy mothers.
And joy is welcomed in such a needy time.
Where do you come from?
Is my father well?
I can hit quickly, if I’m motivated.
O, will you leave me so unsatisfied?
A greater power than we can contradict Has opposed our plans.
Then, do my lips have the sin that they have taken from yours?.
So stop crying.
It’s 9 AM.
O cousin, cousin!
What shall I swear by?
Well, we were born to die.
If he hears you, you will make him angry.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Don’t you have any word of joy?
I beg for justice, which you, prince, must give; Romeo killed Tybalt.
Get going, get out of here, leave!
Peace, ho, for shame!
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?
I will follow you.
In faith, we may put up our pipes and go home.
Put your sword away, or use it to help me break up this fight.
What, not a word?
Then she is well, and nothing can be wrong.
Sweet, so do I.
By our Lady, thirty years.
By Mary, that, I think, is young Petruchio.
Go quickly to high fortune!
What noise is here?
To answer that question, I should confess to you.
Death lies on her like an untimely frost On the sweetest flower in all the fields.
Scurvy knave!
This cannot anger him.
I cannot move.
That dreamers often lie.
But why, villain, did you kill my cousin?
Madam, good night.
Then, I’ll give it to you as payment.
Give me those flowers.
Romeo killed him; he killed Mercutio.
Leave me, and do as I ask you.
Give me your torch, boy.
Fear comes over me.
Here comes your father.
A jealous spy, a jealous spy!
For what, please tell me?
Away with the good stools, remove the china closet, look to the plate.
Makes no difference.
I’m not telling a lie.
The excuse that you make in this delay Is longer than the tale you excuse.
O mischief, you are quick To enter into the thoughts of desperate men!
What!
Did you give the finger to us, sir?
I will bring you there.
what does that mean?
Well, in that hit, you miss.
The time is of such a boring duration.
Are you picking a fight with us, sir?
I am for you.
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love you Does excuse very much the rage that is appropriate For such a greeting.
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
I am not long, I guarantee, for this world.
Gentle Mercutio, put up your sword.
For shame, for shame!
I have more care to stay than will to go.
Commend me to thy lady; And bid her to hurry the whole house to bed, Which heavy sorrow makes them more likely to do.
Call him, good Mercutio.
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair, To earn her own happiness by making me despair.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do beg her eyes To twinkle in their sockets till the stars return.
Couple of days or not, of all days in the year, Come the middle of July, she’ll be fourteen.
Have you killed Tybalt?
You say well.
Romeo shall thank you, daughter, for us both.
If I live to see you married, I have my wish.
Then tell what you know about all of this.
I wouldn’t have them see you here for the world.
Do you like this speed?
What will you give us?
But you’re not quickly motivated to hit.
No, I am the very small spot of courtesy.
There’s plenty of time.
You are to blame, my lord, to berate her like this.
Farewell.
Benvolio, who began this bloody fight?
Travel to Mantua.
What is do you need?
Thirsty sorrow drinks our blood.
O most wicked, evil woman!
My sword, I say!
What, wake up, man!
Come here, nurse.
Come, death, and welcome!
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
Why, how are you, Juliet?
Death, that has taken her away to make me wail, Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
Why do you stay?
What early tongue so sweetly salutes me?
A day as black as this has never been seen!
You speak honestly.
Then, I’ll get you, boy!
Romeo.
What does he say about our marriage?
O life!
What villain, madam?
Commend me to your lady.
I won’t miss a chance To send you my greetings, love.
I’m only trying to keep the peace.
Can heaven be so jealous?
I will work it out, And everything will be fine, I guarantee you, wife.
Yeah, is the worst well?
O, forgive me for bringing you this sad news, Since you did leave it all up to me, sir.
So ho!
What if this mixture doesn’t work at all?
I thought it was all for the best.
Is love a tender thing?
That is because the traitor murderer lives.
Good night.
One fairer than my love?
Not me, believe me.
Hold him in safety until the prince arrives.
I will not fail!
O brother Montague, give me your hand.
We found him in the churchyard.
I think He told me Paris was going to marry Juliet.
Romeo!
Was I with you there for the goose?
This is no time to play.
Go away, and stand over there.
Mistress!
Young Romeo, is it?
call her to come to me.
Look, and you’ll see.
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?
I have had it, and soundly too.
Where are the wicked beginners of this fight?
Then, I defy you, stars!
Your drugs are quick.
I did give the finger, sir.
Peter!
Here comes my man.
Well, what was yours?
Your lady mother is coming to your bedroom.
Strike!
Let’s go, and, with a clear eye, Compare her face with some others that I shall show you, And I will make you think your swan is a crow.
Believe me, I can tell her age to the hour.
You won’t play then?
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
Romeo is coming.
It’s almost night now.
Give me that chisel-edged pick and the iron wrench.
O lord, they’re fighting!
I work for as good a man as you do.
Come, come away!
