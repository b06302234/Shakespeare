villain am i none .
give me , give me !
what , shall i groan and tell thee ?
alack the day !
he was not born to shame .
if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep , my dreams presage some joyful news at hand .
either thou or i , or both , must go with him .
there lies the man , slain by young romeo , that slew thy kinsman , brave mercutio .
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ?
o woeful , woeful , woeful day !
come , vial .
and what to ?
right glad i am he was not at this fray .
i would the fool were married to her grave !
no better .
help me into some house , benvolio , or i shall faint .
blind is his love and best befits the dark .
i am sped .
ay , mine own fortune in my misery .
for doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
o love !
welcome from mantua .
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
welcome , gentlemen !
stay the friar too .
the son and heir of old tiberio .
is he gone and hath nothing ?
may not one speak ?
marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .
i will frown as i pass by , and let them take it as they list .
romeo will answer it .
my dismal scene i needs must act alone .
madam , i am here .
now , afore god , i am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
as i did sleep under this yew tree here , i dreamt my master and another fought , and that my master slew him .
is the day so young ?
romeo can , though heaven cannot .
what devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?
thus with a kiss i die .
take thou some new infection to thy eye , and the rank poison of the old will die .
i will carry no crotchets .
i would i were thy bird .
any man that can write may answer a letter .
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?
hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?
peter , stay at the gate .
go tell him of this .
faith , i know not what to say .
i will go call the watch .
what , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?
give me my sin again .
what is her mother ?
i will confess to you that i love him .
young son , it argues a distempered head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .
some twenty of them fought in this black strife , and all those twenty could but kill one life .
in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman .
search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
a man , young lady !
if love be blind , love cannot hit the mark .
perhaps you have learned it without book .
tybalt , my cousin !
where the devil should this romeo be ?
as i remember , this should be the house .
you are too hot .
shame come to romeo !
tell me , good my friend , what torch is yond that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls ?
who calls so loud ?
every one prepare to follow this fair corse unto her grave .
o woe !
now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in .
is it e 'en so ?
the time is very short .
but to be frank , and give it thee again .
where is my mother ?
monday !
to our house .
what hast thou found ?
good even to my ghostly confessor .
will you go to them ?
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .
can i go forward when my heart is here ?
look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .
what is the matter ?
a right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
no , not till thursday .
as much to him , else is his thanks too much .
peace , you mumbling fool !
by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am .
tell me , daughter juliet , how stands your disposition to be married ?
thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .
or shall we on without apology ?
romeo , away , be gone !
pitiful sight !
what , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
by my heel , i care not .
could you not take some occasion without giving ?
tis he , that villain romeo .
need you my help ?
o me , o me !
come , what says romeo ?
his son was but a ward two years ago .
nurse !
take thou that .
what , lamb !
what , ho !
but now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?
we talk here in the public haunt of men .
in love ?
without his roe , like a dried herring .
o romeo , romeo !
you lie .
rest you merry !
i neither know it nor can learn of him .
no , my good lord .
the fee simple ?
what says romeo ?
saint francis be my speed !
good romeo , hide thyself .
what counterfeit did i give you ?
i am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
father , what news ?
it is not yet near day .
so will ye , i am sure , that you love me .
why , bride !
have you delivered to her our decree ?
a challenge , on my life .
well , peace be with you , sir .
supper is done , and we shall come too late .
thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .
what , art thou hurt ?
see where she comes from shrift with merry look .
who bare my letter , then , to romeo ?
her vestal livery is but sick and green , and none but fools do wear it .
tis late .
do you not see that i am out of breath ?
do as i bid thee , go .
an thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .
is she not proud ?
o heavy day !
do not deny to him that you love me .
how canst thou try them so ?
the boy gives warning something doth approach .
why , may one ask ?
but come what sorrow can , it cannot countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight .
god mark thee to his grace !
do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
no , coz , i rather weep .
she will indite him to some supper .
commend me to your daughter .
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?
good morrow to you both .
hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
henceforward do your messages yourself .
wilt thou provoke me ?
whither should they come ?
ay , boy , ready .
o heavens !
will it not be ?
full half an hour .
ready to go , but never to return .
fear me not .
how should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
out on her , hilding !
they call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
o lamentable day !
that i ask again , for nothing can be ill if she be well .
out upon you !
so thrive my soul- a thousand times good night !
what can he say in this ?
wash they his wounds with tears ?
up .
by my count , i was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid .
what noise is this ?
o flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !
i do beseech you , sir , have patience .
art thou a man ?
an i were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
i hear some noise .
quarrel , sir ?
go thou to juliet , help to deck up her .
well , think of marriage now .
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
o rude unthankfulness !
so shalt thou show me friendship .
he is wise , and , on my life , hath stol 'n him home to bed .
who knocks so hard ?
ay , forsooth .
look thou but sweet , and i am proof against their enmity .
i hear some noise within .
what , dost thou make us minstrels ?
come hither , man .
am i like such a fellow ?
ay , ay , the cords .
i will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
what further woe conspires against mine age ?
whose house ?
nay , gentle romeo , we must have you dance .
bliss be upon you !
answer me like men .
god in heaven bless her !
i wot well where he is .
down with the montagues !
how long hath he been there ?
no matter .
dost thou love me ?
o deadly sin !
the all-seeing sun ne 'er saw her match since first the world begun .
and yet i wish but for the thing i have .
i know not .
farewell !
answer to that .
send thy man away .
some comfort , nurse .
this is well .
was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound ?
wherefore storm you so ?
now god in heaven bless thee !
that may be , sir , when i may be a wife .
madam !
it was .
go with me to the vault .
your mother .
what say you ?
down with the capulets !
who is it ?
i pray , sir , can you read ?
amen !
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
farewell , my coz .
why , she is within .
or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
why the devil came you between us ?
thou dost not mark me .
therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me .
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
where is my romeo ?
hark you , sir .
hast thou met with him ?
these are news indeed !
a madness most discreet , a choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
where is she ?
my fan , peter .
i will go along .
no , sir .
come , stir , stir , stir !
she speaks , yet she says nothing .
ah me !
your plantain leaf is excellent for that .
will you tell me that ?
but what say you to thursday ?
this same should be the voice of friar john .
do as thou wilt , for i have done with thee .
stay , tybalt , stay !
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing .
let me stand here till thou remember it .
i will be brief , for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale .
let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
said he not so ?
take it in what sense thou wilt .
ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .
hang him , jack !
nurse ?
good heart , at what ?
is your man secret ?
what ?
the prince will doom thee death if thou art taken .
the what ?
i will say for you .
now do you know the reason of this haste .
it is the lark that sings so out of tune , straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
you are a saucy boy .
i do remember well where i should be , and there i am .
an eagle , madam , hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye as paris hath .
unhappy fortune !
not proud you have , but thankful that you have .
what is it else ?
lie thou there .
no .
well , sir .
how fares my juliet ?
thus then in brief : the valiant paris seeks you for his love .
a right good markman !
monday , my lord .
spakest thou of juliet ?
talk no more .
too familiar is my dear son with such sour company .
what , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
where should she be ?
god ye good morrow , gentlemen .
you shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .
stand up .
hold , then .
good night , good night !
how is it with her ?
o simple !
why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
hark ye , your romeo will be here at night .
hath romeo slain himself ?
on thursday , sir ?
your part in her you could not keep from death , but heaven keeps his part in eternal life .
make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .
what , are you busy , ho ?
and so did i.
and trust me , love , in my eye so do you .
out , you baggage !
give me thy hand .
how now ?
was that my father that went hence so fast ?
how doth my lady ?
clubs , bills , and partisans !
o me !
what is this ?
this shall determine that .
there lies that tybalt .
for i ne 'er saw true beauty till this night .
i have forgot why i did call thee back .
the citizens are up , and tybalt slain .
nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .
yea , noise ?
so shall you feel the loss , but not the friend which you weep for .
wilt thou be gone ?
i was hurt under your arm .
madam , your mother craves a word with you .
have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
the other did not so .
i know not , sir .
your houses !
o , teach me how i should forget to think !
why dost thou wring thy hands ?
madam , i am not well .
it makes me mad .
even so lies she , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
o , be gone !
hie to your chamber .
this is the truth , or let benvolio die .
perchance she cannot meet him .
i have .
tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it at your hands .
have at thee , coward !
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
my naked weapon is out .
wife !
and why , my lady wisdom ?
here comes the furious tybalt back again .
ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .
can you not stay awhile ?
we are undone , lady , we are undone !
i beseech thee , youth , put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury .
i will kiss thy lips .
for what purpose , love ?
by the hour of nine .
you know not what you do .
nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .
younger than she are happy mothers made .
and joy comes well in such a needy time .
whence come you ?
is my father well ?
i strike quickly , being moved .
o , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
a greater power than we can contradict hath thwarted our intents .
then have my lips the sin that they have took .
then weep no more .
but new struck nine .
o cousin , cousin !
what shall i swear by ?
well , we were born to die .
an if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
hast thou not a word of joy ?
i beg for justice , which thou , prince , must give .
hence , be gone , away !
peace , ho , for shame !
tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?
i will follow you .
faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .
put up thy sword , or manage it to part these men with me .
what , not a word ?
then she is well , and nothing can be ill .
sweet , so would i.
by 'r lady , thirty years .
marry , that , i think , be young petruchio .
hie to high fortune !
what noise is here ?
to answer that , i should confess to you .
death lies on her like an untimely frost upon the sweetest flower of all the field .
scurvy knave !
this cannot anger him .
you are a lover .
that dreamers often lie .
but wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
madam , good night .
i will then give it you soundly .
give me those flowers .
romeo slew him ; he slew mercutio .
leave me and do the thing i bid thee do .
give me thy torch , boy .
fear comes upon me .
here comes your father .
a jealous hood , a jealous hood !
for what , i pray thee ?
away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate .
tis all one .
i speak no treason .
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
o mischief , thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men !
soft !
do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
i will bring you thither .
what of that ?
well , in that hit you miss .
the date is out of such prolixity .
do you quarrel , sir ?
i am for you .
tybalt , the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting .
my husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .
i am peppered , i warrant , for this world .
gentle mercutio , put thy rapier up .
fie , fie !
i have more care to stay than will to go .
commend me to thy lady , and bid her hasten all the house to bed , which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .
call , good mercutio .
she is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , to merit bliss by making me despair .
why , what is tybalt ?
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , having some business , do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return .
even or odd , of all days in the year , come lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen .
hast thou slain tybalt ?
you say well .
romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
an i might live to see thee married once , i have my wish .
then say at once what thou dost know in this .
i would not for the world they saw thee here .
do you like this haste ?
what will you give us ?
but thou art not quickly moved to strike .
nay , i am the very pink of courtesy .
there is time enough .
you are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
farewell .
benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?
sojourn in mantua .
what is your will ?
dry sorrow drinks our blood .
o most wicked fiend !
my sword , i say !
what , rouse thee , man !
come hither , nurse .
come , death , and welcome !
three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed .
why , how now , juliet ?
death , that hath ta 'en her hence to make me wail , ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
why dost thou stay ?
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?
never was seen so black a day as this .
ye say honestly .
then have at thee , boy !
romeo .
what says he of our marriage ?
o life !
what villain , madam ?
commend me to thy lady .
i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
i do but keep the peace .
can heaven be so envious ?
tush , i will stir about , and all things shall be well , i warrant thee , wife .
yea , is the worst well ?
o , pardon me for bringing these ill news , since you did leave it for my office , sir .
so ho !
what if this mixture do not work at all ?
i thought all for the best .
is love a tender thing ?
that is because the traitor murderer lives .
good night .
one fairer than my love ?
not i , believe me .
hold him in safety till the prince come hither .
i will not fail .
o brother montague , give me thy hand .
we found him in the churchyard .
i think he told me paris should have married juliet .
romeo !
was i with you there for the goose ?
tis no time to play now .
hence , and stand aloof .
mistress !
young romeo is it ?
call her forth to me .
look , and thou shalt see .
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo ?
i have it , and soundly too .
where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
then i defy you , stars !
thy drugs are quick .
i do bite my thumb , sir .
peter !
here comes my man .
well , what was yours ?
your lady mother is coming to your chamber .
strike !
go thither , and with unattainted eye compare her face with some that i shall show , and i will make thee think thy swan a crow .
faith , i can tell her age unto an hour .
you will not then ?
o wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
romeo is coming .
tis now near night .
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .
o lord , they fight !
i serve as good a man as you .
come , come away .
