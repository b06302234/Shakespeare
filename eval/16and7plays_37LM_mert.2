if i may trust the event , whilst i slept , my dreams unto some joyful news is coming . 
either thou , or i , or both of us , must go with him . 
there lies the man slain by young romeo , that kill 'd your cousin , brave mercutio . 
how dost thou out of breath , when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ? 
o woeful , woeful , woeful day !

and what ? 
i am very glad he was would not at this quarrel . 
i wish the foolish wench wedded to her grave !

his love is blind and it becomes the dark best . 
i am done . 
ay , mine own fortune in my misery . 
for doting , not for loving , my pupil . 
o love ! 
welcome in mantua . 
i will bite thee on the ear for that jest ! 
welcome , gentlemen ! 
hold the friar too . 
the son and heir of old tiberio . 
is he gone , and he hath nothing ? 
may one would not speak ? 
marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound . 
let them take 't their will . 
romeo will answer it . 
i must act my dreadful scene alone . 
madam , i am here . 
now , afore god , i am so wrath that every part of me quivers . 
as i was sleeping yew under this tree here , i did dream , that my master and another fought , and that my master slew him . 
good morrow , cousin is 't morning ? 
romeo can , though heaven cannot . 
what devil art thou that wonder me thus ? 
so , i die with a kiss . 
take some new infection to your eye , and the rank poison of the old love shall die . 
i would not any hooked instruments . 
i would i were your bird . 
any man that can write may answer a letter . 
did ever a dragon keep so fair a cave ? 
do you would not letters to me from the friar ? 
peter , stay at the gate . 
go tell him of this . 
faith , i would not know what to say . 
i 'll go call the watch . 
what shall we give as our excuse ? 
give me my sin again . 
who is her mother ? 
i will confess to you that i love him . 
young son , ' tis arguably a distempered head that bids good-morrow so soon to your bed . 
some twenty of them fought in this black fight , and all those twenty could but take one life . 
in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman . 
search , seek , and know how this foul murder chanced . 
a man , young lady ! 
if love be blind , would not love can find the siege . 
perchance you have learned it without book . 
tybalt , my cousin ! 
where the devil can this be romeo ? 
as i remember , this should be the house . 
you are too hot under the collar . 
shame come to romeo ! 
tell me , good my friend , what torch is yonder that wastes giving his light to grubs and eyeless skull ? 
who is called so loud ? 
every one should prepare to follow this fair corse unto her grave . 
o woe ! 
now he is for the quarry that petrarch flowed in ! 
is 't so ? 
that 's very shortly . 
but to be honest and give it thee again . 
where is my mother ? 
monday ! 
to supper ; to our house . 
what hast thou found ? 
good even to my ghostly confessor . 
will you go to them ? 
can you would not speak of what you would not do feel . 
shall i go home , when my heart is here ? 
look , sir , here the lady is coming toward my cell . 
ay , madam , from the length of my hands . 
what 's the matter ? 
a right fair mark , fair coz , is the first hit . 
no , not till thursday . 
as much to him , else his thanks is too much . 
peace , you mumbling fool ! 
by a name that i would not know how to tell you what i am . 
tell me , daughter juliet , what think you of married ? 
thou never wast with me for any thing when thou wert not there for the goose . 
or shall we do but go on without any apology ? 
romeo , hence , avaunt ! 
pitiful sight ! 
what , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ? 
by my heel , i care not . 
would not take thou some occasion without my giving you one ? 
' tis he , that villain , romeo . 
do you need my help ? 
o me , o me ! 
come , what says romeo ? 
his son was but a ward two years ago . 
nurse ! 
take thou that . 
what , lamb ! 
what , ho ! 
but now , my lord , what say you to my suit ? 
we 're talking here in a public place . 
in love ? 
without his fish eggs , like a dried herring . 
o romeo , romeo ! 
you 're a boggler ! 
have a gentle day ! 
i would not know , and he will would not tell me . 
no , my good lord . 
the rash estate ! 
what says romeo ? 
saint francis be my speed ! 
good romeo , hide thyself . 
what false take did i give thee ? 
i am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse name . 
father , what news ? 
it 's no morning yet . 
so shall you confess , i am sure , that you love me . 
why , bride ! 
have you told her what we have concluded for her ? 
a challenge , on my life . 
well , peace be with you , sir . 
supper is done , and we shall come too late . 
you will not budge a foot to fight ! 
what , art thou hurt ? 
see where she comes from confession with a merry cheer . 
the , who takes my letter to romeo ? 
her chaste , white gown is but sick and green , and only fools wear it . 
it 's past . 
do you would not see that i 'm out of breath ? 
go , do what i have told you . 
if you make us musicians , look to hear nothing but noise . 
is she would not proud ? 
o heavy day ! 
don would not deny to him that you love me . 
how can see ' em ? 
the boy lends the warning something is expiate . 
why , may one ask ? 
but what sorrow can come , it cannot equivocal the exchange of joy that one short minute in her eye gives me . 
god mark thee for his grace ! 
do so , and bid my sweet to prepare to chide me . 
no , cousin , i 'ld rather weep . 
she will give him a writ parley to some supper . 
commend me to your daughter . 
don would not thou bring me letters from the friar ? 
good morrow to you both . 
trip , make speed , for it grows very late . 
from this time forth , do your messages yourself . 
wilt thou still provoke me ? 
where should they come ? 
ay , boy , ready . 
o heaven ! 
what , you 're suited ! 
a full half hour . 
&bra; aside to go , but never to return . 
don would not care of me . 
how should they , when wise men have no eyes ? 
throw her out , the good for nothing ! 
they 're imploring dates and quinces in the pastry . 
o lamentable day ! 
i 'll ask that again ; for nothing can be wrong , if she be well . 
fie on thee ! 
i 'll tarry , a thousand times good night ! 
what should he say of this ? 
they wash his wounds with tears . 
up . 
by my count i was thy mother pretty near the age that you are now . 
what 's the matter ? 
o flesh , flesh , how dost thou fishified ! 
i pray you , sir , have patience . 
are you a man ? 
if i were so easy to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the rash estate of my life for an hour and a quarter . 
i hear some noise . 
fight , sir ! 
go you to juliet , relieve her ready . 
well , think of marriage now . 
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . 
o rude unthankfulness ! 
this way thou show me friendship . 
he is wise ; and , on my life , he hath stolen home to bed . 
who knocks so hard ? 
yes , indeed , sir , she did . 
if you will but look demurely , then i am protected against their hate . 
i hear some noise within . 
what , dost thou make us musicians ? 
come hither , fellow . 
am i such a fellow ? 
ay , ay , the cords . 
i 'll go , sir , and not trouble you . 
what additional woe conspires against my age ? 
whose house ? 
nay , gentle romeo , we must have you dance . 
blessings on thee ! 
answer me like men . 
god in heaven bless her ! 
i know well where he is . 
down with the montagues ! 
how long hath he been within there ? 
no matter . 
do you love me ? 
o deadly sin ! 
the all-seeing sun ne 'er saw nothing to match her since the world first began . 
and yet i wish but for the thing that i have already . 
i would not know . 
farewell ! 
answer that . 
send thy man away . 
give me some comfort , nurse . 
this is great . 
was there ever man a book containing such vile matter so how but well bound ? 
why dost thou storm so ? 
now god in heaven bless thee ! 
you may call me so , sir , when i may be a wife . 
madam ! 
it was . 
go with me to the monument . 
your mother . 
what say you ? 
down with the capulets ! 
who is 't ? 
good day.-please tell me , sir , can you read ? 
amen ! 
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ? 
farewell , my coz . 
why , she 's within . 
or , if he wrote his mind , give me his letter . 
to romeo &ket; why the devil dost thou come between us ? 
do you would not understand me . 
therefore , he that cannot lick his fingers won would not come back with me . 
who now owes the price of his dear blood ? 
where is my romeo ? 
hark you , sir . 
hast thou met with him ? 
this is the news indeed ! 
a madness most discreet , a s point and choke acid , and a preserving sweet . 
where is she ? 
my fan , peter . 
i 'll go along . 
no , sir . 
come , let 's be gone ! 
she speaks , but she says nothing . 
ay me ! 
your plantain-leaf is excellent for that . 
wilt thou tell me that ? 
but what say you to thursday ? 
this is the voice of friar john . 
do what you mean to do , for i 'll accomplished with you . 
stay , tybalt , soft ! 
but i should kill thee with much cherishing . 
let me stand till you remember . 
i will be brief , for i would not have enough breath to this tedious tale . 
let me wrangle with thee of thy complaining . 
hath he said it ? 
take it any way thou wilt . 
ay , by my troth , the case may be amended . 
fie on him , jack sauce ! 
nurse ? 
good heart , at what ? 
can thy man keep counsel ? 
what ? 
the prince will sentence you to death , if thou art taken prisoner . 
the what ? 
i will say it for you . 
now you know wherefore we 're in haste . 
it is the lark , that sings so out of tune , straining to sing horrible songs and unpleasing notes . 
you are a saucy boy . 
i remember well where i should be ; and here i am . 
an eagle , madam , is not so green , as quick , and hath would not so fair an eye as paris hath . 
very ill luck ! 
i 'll not proud that you have , but i 'll thankful that thou hast . 
what is it else ? 
you lie there . 
no . 
well , sir . 
how fares my juliet ? 
thus , then , here it is : the valiant paris seeks you for his love . 
a right good marksman ! 
monday , my lord . 
did you speak of juliet ? 
talk no more . 
my dear son is too familiar with such sour company . 
what , is your sword out among these rascal people ? 
where should she be ? 
good morrow , gentlemen . 
you shall find me easy enough for that , sir , if you will give me the occasion . 
stand up . 
stay , then . 
good night , good night ! 
how is 't with her ? 
o , how honest ! 
why , is would not this better now than groaning for love ? 
you hearken : your romeo will be here at night . 
hath romeo slew himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
thy part in her you could not keep from death , but heaven keeps his part in eternal life . 
trip , lest my sword will be about your ears ere you be yours out . 
what , are you busy , ho ? 
and so did i. 
and trust me , love , in mine eyes , so do you . 
out , and thou art a bag of offal ! 
give me your hand . 
what 's the matter ? 
was that my father that went away so fast ? 
how fares my lady ? 
cudgels , pikes , and more pikes ! 
o me ! 
what is this ? 
this quarrel shall determine that . 
there lies that same tybalt . 
for i never saw true beauty till this night . 
i have forgot why i call thee back . 
the citizens are up , and tybalt is dead . 
nay , if there were two such fellows , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other . 
ay , noise ? 
you 'll feel the loss , but not the loss of the friend you weep for . 
are you bound ? 
i was hurt under your arm . 
madam , your mother craves a word with you . 
don would not saints and holy pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other did would not . 
i know not , sir . 
your houses ! 
o , teach me how i should forget to think . 
why dost thou wringing your hands ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it makes me angry . 
she lies the catalogue , blubbering and weep , weeping and blubbering . 
if not , you would have made thy tale large . 
o , away ! 
hie you to your chamber . 
this is the truth , or let benvolio die . 
perchance she can would not meet him . 
i have . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it from thee . 
to fight with me , coward ! 
let me weep for such a feeling loss . 
it 's forth already ! 
wife ! 
and wherefore dost thou butting in , my lady wisdom ? 
here comes the furious tybalt back again . 
ay , the heads of maids , or their virgin patent up . 
can you would not rest awhile ? 
we are undone , lady , we are undone ! 
i pray thee , youth , would not put another sin upon my head by urging me to fight . 
i will kiss thy lips . 
why , love ? 
at nine . 
do you would not know what you 're graces ! 
nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress . 
younger girls than she are made happy mothers . 
and joy is received in such a needy time . 
where do you come from ? 
is my father well ? 
i may strike quickly , if i 'm full of purpose . 
o , wilt thou leave me so unstanched ? 
a greater power than we can contradict hath opposed our purposes . 
then , do my lips have the sin that they have ta 'en from yours ? . 
so stop weeping . 
it 's 9 am . 
o cousin , cousin ! 
what shall i swear by ? 
well , we were born to die . 
if he hears thee , thou wilt anger him . 
be patient , for the world is broad and wide . 
don would not have you any word of joy ? 
i pray for justice , which you , prince , must give ; romeo slew tybalt . 
get you gone , hence , away ! 
peace , ho , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ? 
i will follow you . 
in faith , we may put up our pipes , and get you home . 
put up your sword , or use it to help me break up this quarrel . 
what , not a word ? 
then she is well , and nothing can be amiss . 
sweet , so do i. 
by 'r lady , thirty years . 
marry , that , methinks , is young petruchio . 
go quickly to high fortune ! 
what noise is here ? 
to answer that question , i must confess to you . 
death lies on her like an untimely frost upon the sweetest flower in all the fields . 
scurvy knave ! 
this cannot anger him . 
i cannot move . 
that dreamers often lie . 
but why , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then , i 'll give it to you as payment . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo slew him ; he slew mercutio . 
leave me , and do as i bid you . 
give me thy torch , boy . 
fear comes o 'er me . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous spy , a jealous spy ! 
for what , i pray you , tell me ? 
away with the good stools , remove the china wardrobe lies , look to the plate . 
all 's one . 
i 'll not forced to a lie . 
the excuse that you make in this delay is longer than the tale thou excuse . 
o mischief , thou art quick to enter into the thoughts of desperate men ! 
what ! 
didst thou give the finger to us , sir ? 
i will bring you thither . 
what should this mean ? 
well , in that hit you miss . 
the time is of such a tedious duration . 
are you powers above put on their instruments a fight with us , sir ? 
i am for you . 
tybalt , the reason that i have to love thee doth excuse much the rage that is fitting for such a greeting . 
my husband is on earth , my faith in heaven . 
i am not long , i warrant , for this world . 
gentle mercutio , put up your sword . 
fie , fie ! 
i have more care to keep than will to go . 
commend me to thy lady ; and bid her to the whole hie you home to bed , which heavy sorrow makes them more like to do . 
call him , good mercutio . 
she is too fair , too wise ; wisely too fair , to earn her own happiness by making me despair . 
why , what is tybalt ? 
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , having some business , do importune her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till the stars return . 
two of days , or no , of all days i ' the year , come in the midst of july , she 'll be fourteen . 
hast thou slain tybalt ? 
you say well . 
romeo shall thank you , daughter , for us both . 
if i live to see you married , i have my wish . 
then tell what you know of this business . 
i would have them would not see you here for the world . 
dost thou like this speed ? 
what will you give us ? 
but you 're not quickly full of purpose to hit . 
nay , i am the very small angle of courtesy . 
there 's foison of time . 
you are to blame , my lord , to berate her thus . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who began this bloody fray ? 
post to of mantua . 
what is need you ? 
thirsty sorrow drinks our blood . 
o most wicked , pernicious woman ! 
my sword , i say ! 
what , awake , man ! 
come hither , nurse . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . 
why , how dost thou , juliet ? 
death , that hath ta 'en her hence to make me wail , ties up my tongue and will not let me speak . 
why dost thou stay ? 
what early tongue so sweetly recommends me ? 
a day as black as this hath ne 'er been seen ! 
you speak troth . 
then , i 'll fetch thee , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say of our marriage ? 
o life ! 
what villain , madam ? 
commend me to thy lady . 
i would not miss a chance to send you my greeting , love . 
i 'm only mean to keep the peace . 
can heaven be so jealous ? 
i will piece it out , and all things shall be well , i warrant you , wife . 
ay , is the worst well ? 
o , pardon me for bringing you this sad tidings , since you did leave it all to me , sir . 
so ho ! 
what if this mingle doth would not work at all ? 
i thought it was for the best . 
is love a tender thing ? 
that is for the traitor murderer lives . 
good night . 
one fairer than my love ? 
not i , believe me . 
hold him in safety , till the prince be found . 
i will not fail ! 
o brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he bade me paris was going to wed juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i with you there for the goose ? 
this is no time to play . 
away , and stand yonder . 
mistress ! 
young romeo , is it ? 
call her to come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo ? 
i have had it , and soundly too . 
where are the wicked beginners of this fray ? 
then , i defy thee , stars ! 
thy drugs are quick . 
i did give the finger , sir . 
peter ! 
here comes my man . 
well , what was yours ? 
your lady mother is coming to your chamber . 
strike ! 
let 's away , and with a clear eye , compare her face with some other that i shall show thee , and i will make you think thy swan is a crow . 
believe me , i can tell her age to the hour . 
will you would not play then ? 
o wife , look how our daughter bleeds ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's almost night now . 
give me that chisel-edged pick and the iron wrench . 
o lord , they 're fighting ! 
i serve as good a man as you do . 
come , come away !
