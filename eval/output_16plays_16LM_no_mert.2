He was not born to shame. 
If I may trust the event while I sleep, My dreams voice some joyful news is coming. 
Either you or I, or two of us, must go with him. 
There lies the man art thou down by young Romeo, That for thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. 
How are you out of breath, when you have breath To say to me that you are out of breath?

And to what? 
I am very glad he wasn't at this fight.

Some twenty of them in this black fight, And those twenty could but take one life. 
In sadness, cousin, I love a woman. 
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder happened. 
A man, young lady! 
If love is blind, love can't find the spot. 
Perhaps you have learned it without book.

What? 
The prince will sentence you to death If you are taken prisoner. 
The what? 
I will say it for you. 
Now you know wherefore we're in a hurry. 
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining to sing monstrous songs and unpleasing notes. 
You are a ground boy. 
I remember well where I should be, And here I am. 
An eagle, madam, Is not as green, as quick, and hasn't so fair an eye As Paris has. 
Very bad luck! 
I'm not proud that you have, but I'm thankful that you have.

Was that my father that went away so fast? 
How is my lady doing? 
Clubs, pikes, and more pikes! 
O me! 
What is this? 
This fight shall determine that. 
There lies that same Tybalt. 
For I never saw true beauty till this night. 
I have forgot why I called you back. 
The citizens are up, and Tybalt is dead. 
No, if there were two such fellows, we should have none shortly, for one should kill the other. 
Yes, noise? 
You'll feel the loss, but not the loss of the friend You weep for. 
Are you going? 
I was hurt your arm. 
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. 
Don't saints and holy pilgrims have lips too? 
The other didn't. 
I know not, sir. 
Your houses! 
O, teach me how I shall forget to think.

Madam, I am not well. 
It makes me angry. 
She lies the same way, Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. 
Otherwise, you would have made thy tale large.

Hurry to your chamber. 
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. 
Maybe she can't meet him. 
I have. 
Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it from you. 
Fight me, coward! 
Let me for my such a loss. 
It's out already! 
Wife! 
And why are you butting in, my lady wisdom? 
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. 
Yes, the heads of maids, or their virginity. 
Can't you rest awhile? 
We are ruined, lady, we are ruined! 
I beg you, youth, Don't put a sin on my head By urging me to fight. 
I will kiss your lips. 
Why, love? 
At nine. 
You don't know what you're doing! 
Nurse, commend me to your lady and mistress.

And joy is welcomed in such a needy time.

O, will you leave me so unsatisfied? 
A greater power than we may contradict Has stood out against our plans. 
Then, do my lips have the sin that they have taken from yours?. 
So hold crying. 
It's 9 AM. 
O cousin, cousin! 
What shall I swear by? 
Well, we were born to die.

Don't you have any word of joy? 
I beg justice, which you, prince, must give; Romeo killed Tybalt. 
Get going, out of here, leave! 
Peace, ho, for shame! 
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?

Then she is well, and nothing can be wrong.

By our Lady, thirty years. 
By Mary, that, I think, is young Petruchio. 
Go quickly to high fortune!

To answer that question, I shall confess to you. 
Death lies upon her like an untimely frost On the sweetest flower in all the fields. 
Scurvy knave! 
This cannot anger him. 
I cannot move. 
That dreamers oft lie. 
But why, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? 
good night. Madam, 
Then, I'll give it you as payment. 
those flowers. Give me . 
Romeo killed him; he killed Mercutio. 
Leave me, and do as I ask you. 
Give me your torch, boy. 
Fear comes o 'er me. 
Here comes your father. 
A jealous spy, a jealous spy! 
i pray you tell me? For what, 
Away with the good stools, remove the china closet, look to the plate. 
Makes no difference.

The pardon that you make in this delay Is longer than the tale you excuse. 
O mischief, you are quick To enter into the thoughts of desperate men! 
What! 
Did you give the finger to us, sir? 
I will bring you there. 
what does this mean? 
Well, in that hit, you miss. 
The time is of such a dry duration. 
Are you powers above put on their instruments a fight with us, sir? 
I for you. 
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love you Does excuse very much in that is better For such a greeting. 
My husband is on earth, the faith in heaven. 
I am not long, I guarantee, for this world. 
Gentle Mercutio, put up your sword. 
For shame, for shame! 
I have more care to stay than will to go. 
Commend me to thy lady; And bid her to make all the house to bed, Which heavy sorrow makes them more like to do. 
Call him, good Mercutio. 
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair, To earn her own happiness by me despair. 
what is Tybalt? Why, 
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till the stars return. 
Couple of days or not, of all days in the year, Come the midst of July, she'll be fourteen. 
thou hast killed Tybalt? Have 
You say well. 
Romeo shall i thank you, daughter, for us both. 
If I live to see you married, I have my wish. 
Then tell what you know all of this. 
I wouldn't have them see thee for the world. 
Do you thus speed? 
will you give us? What 
But you're not quickly motivated to hit. 
No, I am the very much mint of courtesy. 
There's foison follow of time. 
You are to blame, my lord, to berate her like this. 
Farewell.

Mistress! 
Young Romeo, is it?

Look, and you'll see. 
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?

Let's go, and, with a fair eye, Compare her face with some other that I shall show you, And I will make you think your swan is a crow. 
Believe me, I can tell her age to the hour. 
You won't play then? 
O wife, see how our daughter bleeds! 
Romeo is coming. 
It's almost night now. 
Give me that chisel-edged take and the iron wrench. 
O lord, they're fighting! 
I serve as good a man as you do. 
Come, come away!
