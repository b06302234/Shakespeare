i am no villain . 
give it me ! 
you mean i should groan , and tell you ? 
beshrew the day ! 
he was not born to be shame . 
if i can assure my dreams , some joyful news is coming . 
either thou , or i , or both of us have to go with him . 
he slew thy kinsman , brave mercutio , and then young romeo kill 'd him . 
how canst thou be out of breath , when you have enough breath to tell me that you 're out of breath ? 
o painful , o , o day ! 
why , here 's the vial . 
and what of that ? 
i 'm glad he was not here for this fight . 
i would the fool were dead and married to her grave ! 
but he 's not better than mine . 
take me in some house , benvolio , or i 'll wear out . 
his love is blind , so it is yours in the dark . 
i 'll cease . 
i can read mine own fortune in my misery . 
i did upbraid you for obsessing of her , not to love her , my student . 
o love ! 
welcome back in mantua . 
i 'll sting thee on the ear for that jest . 
welcome , gentlemen . 
hold the friar too . 
he is the son and heir of old tiberio . 
did he hence clean ? 
may not i speak ? 
well , sir , for silver hath a sweet sound . 
i 'll frown upon them as they pass by , and they can react what they will . 
romeo will answer the challenge . 
in my desperate condition , i have to act alone . 
madam , i 'll here . 
now , i swear , i 'll so that i 'll shaking of all o 'er . 
as i slept under this yew-tree here , i had a dream , that my master and were quarrel and that my master to kill him . 
is it that betimes in the day ? 
romeo is odious , though god is not . 
what kind of devil art thou to torture me thus ? 
so i die with a kiss . 
but here come some , in the nick of time . 
i 'll make you sing . 
i would i was your bird . 
no man , who knows how to write to answer a letter . 
did a dragon ever hide me in such a fair cave ? 
do not you have a letter for me from the friar ? 
peter , stay for me at the gate . 
go tell him of this . 
what say you , james well , i do not know what to say . 
i 'll go call the watch . 
what shall we say is our excuse for being here ? 
give me my sin . 
who is her mother ? 
i 'll confess to you that i love him . 
young man , that 's wrong , if you 're grow out of bed this betimes . 
there were twenty montagues tide in this heinous rise , and all those twenty could but kill one man . 
now , cousin , i love a woman . 
investigate how this foul murder came of . 
what a man , young lady . 
if love is blind , it may not strike the blank . 
perchance you 've out of life , and not from books . 
tybalt was my cousin ! 
where the devil can romeo be ? 
as i remember , this should be the house . 
you 're grow too angry . 
fie on romeo ! 
tell me , my good friend , what is that light there ? 
who 's that calls so loud ? 
all prepare to take this fair corse to her grave . 
o plague ! 
now he 's ready for 
is it true ? 
that 's very shortly . 
but to be free and give it to you once more . 
where is my mother ? 
monday ! 
to our house . 
what hast thou found out ? 
that 's how weak and unreal pleasure is . 
wilt thou join with them ? 
you may not speak of something that you do not feel . 
shall i go away my heart doth here ? 
look , sir , here comes the lady walk towards my cell . 
ay , madam , he lies beyond my gain . 
what is the matter ? 
a fair blank is the one that may strike the fastest . 
no , not till thursday . 
i 'll give him fellow thanks , so we 're even . 
peace , you mumbling fool ! 
tell me , how came you hither ? 
tell me , my daughter juliet , what is your disposition of married ? 
you were never with me for nothing , if you were not for the goose . 
or shall we go without apologizing ? 
romeo , hence . 
this is a pitiful sight ! 
do you mean to wash him out of his grave with tears ? 
well , well , i do not care . 
do not you find a reason without my giving you one ? 
that 's him , that villain romeo . 
do you need my help ? 
o my , o my ! 
come , what did romeo say ? 
his son was a hope but two years ago . 
nurse ! 
take this . 
come , come ! 
what , ho ! 
but what say you to my suit ? 
we 're talking here in a common place . 
you 're in love ? 
he looks slender , like a dried herring without his eggs , and he hath not well . 
o , my ! 
thou liest . 
have a gentle day ! 
i do not know , and he will not tell me . 
no , my good lord . 
thy life surety ? 
what says romeo say ? 
saint francis , help me ! 
withdraw thee , good romeo . 
what do you mean faked you out ? 
i am the youngest man by that name , for there is no one younger , or worse . 
father , what 's the news ? 
it 's so long till the break of day . 
you will also confess , i 'm sure , that you love me . 
how now , bride ! 
have you told her our mind ? 
i warrant it 's a challenge . 
well , may peace be with you . 
it is done , and we 're will be there too late . 
you 're not taking one step toward an enemy . 
what , are you hurt ? 
look , she 's come home from confession with a merry look on her face . 
then that took my letter to romeo ? 
chaste treasure open makes her look pale and green . 
it 's past . 
do not you see that i 'm out of breath ? 
do as i tell you . 
if we look like musicians to you , you may think to hear nothing but noise . 
is not she proud of such a match ? 
o , what a heavy day ! 
do not deny to him that you love me . 
how canst thou bring them ? 
the boy is such me that one does approach . 
why , i pray thee ? 
but what mishaps occur , they may not undo the joy i feel with one look on her . 
god make you to receive his grace . 
do so , and tell my sweet , to be ready to chide me . 
no , cousin , i 'll weep . 
she will a bawd ! 
commend me to your daughter . 
do you bring me a letter from the friar ? 
good morrow to you both . 
dispatch , it 's execution of late . 
from henceforth , take heed of your messages yourself . 
will you provoke me ? 
where are they to come ? 
ay , boy , i 'll ready . 
o heavens ! 
will not he ? 
for a full half hour . 
she 's ready to go , but she 'll ne 'er return . 
do not care of me . 
how should madmen hear , if wise men may not yet see ? 
she disgusts me , the little wanton ! 
they 're call for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen . 
o heavy day ! 
i pray you again for nothing can be wrong , if she be well . 
the hence ! 
my soul depends on it- a thousand times good night . 
i know of this . 
are they washing out his wounds with their tears ? 
up . 
by my count , i was under your mother at but of your age , while you remain a maid . 
what 's this noise ? 
o flesh , flesh , you 've turn 'd pale and weak like a fish . 
i pray you , sir , have patience . 
are you a man ? 
if i were in the trick of all the way , you are , my life surety rates would be sky high . 
i hear some noise . 
set a quarrel ? 
you must to juliet and show her up . 
well , begin thinking of marriage . 
ay , pilgrim-they have lips that they 're to pray with . 
o , rude and unthankful boy ! 
that 's the way to show me love . 
i warrant he slipped away and went to bed . 
why art thou that knocks so much ? 
ay , that 's true . 
but look on me , and i 'll invincible against their hatred . 
i hear a noise in . 
hang out ? â€œ who do you think we are , musicians in a band ? 
come hither , man . 
am i like one of those masters ? 
ay , ay , this is the rope ladder . 
i 'll go , sir , and i will not trouble thee . 
what further pain must i endure in my age ? 
whose house ? 
no , noble romeo , you 've got to dance . 
god bless thee ! 
answer me like men . 
god in heaven bless her ! 
i know where he is . 
down with the montagues ! 
how long hath he been there ? 
no matter . 
do you love me ? 
o , deadly sin ! 
the sun itself is never seen any as fair as the world began . 
but i 'll counsel for that i have . 
i do not know his name . 
farewell ! 
answer that . 
send thy man away . 
give me some comfort , nurse . 
this is good . 
was there ever such an evil book with such a fair cover ? 
why art thou thus so angry ? 
god in heaven bless thee . 
that might be the case , sir , 
madam ! 
it was . 
go with me to the monument . 
your mother . 
lose nothing ? 
down with the capulets ! 
who is it ? 
pray you , sir , do you know how to read ? 
amen ! 
my noble uncle , do you know why he makes this way ? 
farewell , cousin . 
why , she 's in . 
or , if he writ down his thoughts , give me the letter . 
why the devil did you come in between us ? 
you 're not attend me to me . 
so the feeds who can not lick their fingers are not in . 
who should now pay the price of mercutio 's life ? 
where is my romeo ? 
pray you , hear me , sir . 
you have spoke to him ? 
that 's true news ! 
it 's a sweet lozenge that you choke on . 
where is she ? 
give me my fan , peter . 
i 'll go with you . 
no , sir . 
come on , awake , awake , awake ! 
she 's words , but she 's not say nothing . 
o my ! 
for when you cut your shin . 
are you bound to tell me that ? 
what think you on thursday ? 
that resounds as the voice of friar john . 
do as you please , for i 'll done fearing you . 
stay , tybalt , soft ! 
but i would you by petting you too much . 
let me stand till you remember your reason . 
i will be brief for i 'll not live to tell a tedious tale . 
let me speak with you of your fortunes . 
is not that what he said ? 
take my remark in whose sense you please . 
ay , well , things could have better . 
forget of him , jack sauce ! 
nurse ? 
good man , why dost thou weep ? 
can thy man keep counsel ? 
what ? 
the prince will give you the forfeiture , if you be caught . 
he knows what ? 
i 'll answer for you . 
now , you know the reason for the haste . 
it 's the lark , that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise . 
you 're a saucy little boy . 
i remember well where i should be , and here i am . 
madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of paris . 
unhappy fortune ! 
but i am thankful that you have found it . 
what else is love ? 
lie down , and there . 
no . 
why , then . 
how does my juliet ? 
why , then , i 'll say this quickly : the valiant paris desires you as his right . 
then you were well on blank . 
monday , my lord . 
were you talk of juliet ? 
do not say no more . 
you know too much of distress . 
what ? 
where else would she be ? 
good morrow , gentlemen . 
you 'll find me apt enough to do so , sir , if you give me a cause . 
stand up . 
hold on , then . 
good night , good night . 
how is she ? 
that 's foolish . 
why , is not all this jest better than groaning of love ? 
hark , your romeo will be here to-night . 
hath romeo slew himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
you could not prevent her from dying but ever , but heaven will give her eternal life . 
hie thee , or i 'll cuff you on the ears with my sword before you have thine drawn . 
what , are you busy ? 
so did i. 
and trust me , love , you look pale to me too . 
you worthless girl ! 
give me your hand . 
what are you , girl ? 
was my father , that left here in such haste ? 
how does my wife ? 
use your cudgels and spears ! 
o my ! 
what is this ? 
this quarrel will fall who dies . 
tybalt is lying there . 
mine eyes were liars , then , for i never saw true beauty ere night . 
i have forgot , why i call 'd you again . 
the citizens are about , and tybalt is dead . 
if there were two men like you , pretty soon there 'd be none for the two of you would kill each other . 
o , noise ? 
you will be the loss , but the man you weep for will be nothing . 
are you ? 
he struck me from under your arm . 
madam , your mother desires to speak with you . 
do not saints and pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other girl did not love me . 
i do not know , sir . 
beshrew your family ! 
teach me to forget to think ! 
why dost thou look so ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it makes me mad . 
she 's a lie on the ground , like him , blubbering and weep , weeping and blubbering . 
o , you 're deceived . 
o , away ! 
go to your chamber . 
benvolio is part of the montague house . 
perchance she shall not find him . 
i do . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news . 
let 's go at it , coward ! 
let me be weep for such a great loss . 
i have my naked sword out . 
wife ! 
and why , good lady ? 
here comes the furious tybalt back again . 
you mean their cut off their heads , take their maidenheads-whatever . 
you must not stay a little ? 
we 're undone , lady , we 're undone ! 
i pray you , young man , do not make me mad . 
i will kiss thy lips . 
why should you do it , my love ? 
by nine o 'clock . 
gregory , remember how to score . 
nurse , commend me to your lady . 
fie younger than she oft marry , and be happy mothers . 
and ' tis good to have joy in such a joyless . 
where do you come ? 
is my father well ? 
i strike hard when i 'm angry . 
o , thou wilt leave me so unstanched ? 
a greater power than we cannot fight has undone our purpose . 
then do my lips now have the vice they took from thine ? 
hold tears . 
it 's but even now nine o 'clock . 
o cousin , cousin ! 
what should i swear by ? 
well , we were all born to die . 
if he hears you , you 'll make him mad . 
you should be able to endure this for the world is broad and wide . 
do not you have one word of joy ? 
you , prince , are the man that can give me justice . 
so hence ! 
be quiet , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ? 
i 'll follow after . 
well , we may put off our recorders and go home . 
either put up your sword or use it to help me no more of this fight . 
what , you do not speak a word ? 
then she is well , and nothing is wrong . 
my sweet , so do i. 
i swear , it must be thirty years . 
well , that , i think , is young , petruchio . 
would me fortune . 
what 's the noise in here ? 
if i answer 'd that question , i 'll be your confession to you . 
she 's dead , like a fair flower , by an unseasonable frost . 
that foul rat ! 
what i 'll say may not moved him . 
you 're a lover . 
my dream told me that dreamers oft lie . 
but why , thou villain , did you kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then i 'll do give it to you . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo killed tybalt . 
leave me , and do what i told you to do . 
give me your torch , boy . 
i 'll on the sudden fear . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous woman , a jealous woman ! 
what ? 
take away the stools , the sideboards , and the trenchers . 
it 's all the same . 
i 've said nothing wrong . 
the excuse you make to stay the news is longer than the news itself . 
destructive thoughts , come apace to the minds of desperate men ! 
stay . 
are you e 'en at your thumb at us ? 
i 'll bring you there . 
what of that ? 
well , you 're not on blank there . 
it 's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations so . 
are you begin to fight with him ? 
i 'll fight with thee . 
tybalt , i have a cause to love you that gives me lay aside the rage , i should have and excuse that do . 
my husband is alive on earth , my vows of marriage is in heaven . 
i 'm lost in this world , i think . 
noble mercutio , put up your sword . 
fie on thee ! 
i stay to more than i will go . 
commend me to your lady , and tell her to make all in the house to bed . 
call to him , mercutio . 
she 's too fair and too good to deserve heaven 's blessing by making me herself . 
why , what 's tybalt 's tale ? 
two of the brightest stars in all the sky had to go away on business , and they 're bid her eyes to twinkle in their steads till they return . 
whether it 's even or odd , of all the days i ' the year , on the night of lammas eve , she 'll be fourteen . 
you have killed tybalt ? 
thou speak 'st it well . 
romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us . 
if i live to see you marry but ever , all my nature will come true . 
tell us what you know of this affair . 
i 'll give no to keep them from seeing you here . 
do you think it 's a good plot to crush ? 
what will you give us ? 
angry enough to run away . 
the right . 
there 's wood of time . 
my lord , you 're wrong to berate her so . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who began this fight ? 
take a little sequester in of mantua . 
what would you ? 
alas , takes away our tinct . 
o , that most wicked fiend ! 
i would my sword . 
arise , man ! 
come hither , nurse . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and then it 's good night for . 
what 's the matter , juliet ? 
death , which hath ta 'en her to make me weep , now ties up my tongue and will not let me speak . 
why dost thou stay ? 
who does greet me so early in the morning ? 
there was never so black a day as to-day . 
i see . 
why , let 's fight , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say of our marriage ? 
o life ! 
what villain , madam ? 
give my praises to your lady . 
i will not miss any chance to send my love to you . 
i 'll but to keep the peace . 
can god be so jealous and hateful ? 
and all things shall be day , i warrant you , wife . 
is the worst well ? 
o , pardon me , to bring this bad news , but you told me , it was my office , sir . 
i 've found it out . 
what if this mingle doth not work at all ? 
i thought it was well made . 
is love indeed tender ? 
that 's for the murderer is alive . 
good night . 
a woman more beautiful than the one i love ? 
not i , believe me . 
hold him in guard , till the prince is here . 
i will not fail . 
o , brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he bade me paris was about to marry juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i , even to you in the chase for the goose ? 
it 's not the time to play . 
away , and stay the sight of me . 
mistress ! 
is it young romeo ? 
bid her come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i can find young romeo ? 
i 'm lost . 
where is the foul men , who began this fight ? 
then i mutiny against you , stars ! 
his drugs work quickly . 
i 'll e 'en at my thumb . 
peter ! 
here comes my man , the man i 'll seek . 
well , what was thy dream ? 
your mother is come to your chamber . 
possess them ! 
go and compare between her vantage to some other girls i 'll show thee . 
ay , i know her age down to the hour . 
you will not , then ? 
o , look how our daughter bleeds ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's already almost night . 
give me that pickax and the crowbar . 
o lord , they 're fight ! 
my employer is as good as yours . 
come , come away .
