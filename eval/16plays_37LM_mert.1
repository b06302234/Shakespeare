i am no villain . 
give it me ! 
you mean i should groan and tell you ? 
curse the day ! 
he was not born to be shame . 
if i can trust my dreams , after some joyful news is coming anon . 
either thou , or i , or both of us have to go with him . 
he slew thy kinsman , brave mercutio , and then young romeo slew him . 
how canst thou be out of breath , when you have enough breath to tell me that you 're out of breath ? 
o painful , painful , painful day ! 
why , here 's the vial . 
and what of that ? 
i 'm glad he was 't here for this quarrel . 
i wish the fool were dead and married to her grave ! 
but he 's not better than mine . 
take me into some house , benvolio , or i 'll pass along . 
his love is blind , so it by in the dark . 
i 'm done . 
i can read mine own fortune in my woes . 
i upbraid you for obsessing of her , not for loving her , my student . 
o love ! 
welcome back mantua . 
i 'll bite thee on the ear for that jest . 
welcome , gentlemen . 
hold the friar too . 
he is the son and heir of old tiberio . 
did he make away clean ? 
can 't i speak ? 
well , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound . 
i 'll frown upon them as they pass by , and they can react disparagement they crave . 
romeo will answer the challenge . 
in my desperate estate , i must act alone . 
madam , i 'm here . 
now , i swear , i 'm so angry that i 'm shaking honeycomb . 
as i slept under this yew-tree here , i had a dream , that my master and one else were blows and that my master slew him . 
is it that betimes in the day ? 
romeo is hateful , however god is 't . 
what kind of devil art thou to torture me thus ? 
so i die with a kiss . 
but here come some persons , even in the nick of time . 
i 'll make you sing . 
i would i was your bird . 
any man that knows how to write may answer a letter . 
a dragon , did ever hide in such a fair cave ? 
don 't you have a letter for me from the friar ? 
peter , tarry at the gate . 
go tell him of this . 
what say you , james well , i know 't know what to say . 
i 'll go call the watch . 
what shall we say is our excuse for being here ? 
give me my sin again . 
who is her mother ? 
i 'll confess to you that i love him . 
young man , something 's wrong , if you 're grow out of this bed betimes . 
there were twenty montagues fighting in this heinous rise , and all those twenty could but kill one man . 
truly , cousin , i love a woman . 
investigate how this foul murder came of . 
what a man , young lady . 
if love is blind , it may 't hit the target . 
perhaps you 've learned from life and not from books .

where the devil can be romeo ? 
as i remember , this should be the house .

or shall we go without apologizing ?

then that took my letter to romeo ? 
virginity makes her look pale and green . 
it 's late . 
don 't thou seest that i 'm out of breath ? 
do as i bid you . 
if we look like musicians to thee , thou canst expect to hear nothing but noise . 
is 't she proud of such a match ? 
o , what a heavy day ! 
don 't deny to him that you love me . 
how canst thou play them ? 
the boy is such me that one approaches . 
why , i pray thee ? 
but what mishaps occur , they can 't corrupt the joy i feel with one look on her .

she 's words , but she 's not say nothing . 
o my ! 
for when thou cut thy shin . 
are you bound to tell me that ? 
what think you on thursday ? 
that resounds as the voice of friar john . 
do as you please , because i 'm done fearing you . 
stay , tybalt , soft ! 
but , i should kill thee by petting thee too . 
let me stand till you remember your reason . 
i will be brief , because i 'm not live to tell a tedious tale . 
let me speak to thee of thy complaining . 
is 't that what he said ? 
take my remark in whose sense you the like . 
ay , well , things could have better . 
forget about him , jack sauce ! 
nurse ? 
good man , why dost thou weep ? 
can thy man keep counsel ? 
what ? 
the prince will give you the death forfeiture , if you have caught . 
he knows what ? 
i 'll answer for you . 
now you know the reason for the haste . 
it 's the lark , that sings so out of tune , make such rough noise . 
you 're a saucy little boy . 
i remember well where i should be ; and here i am . 
madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of paris . 
unhappy fortune ! 
but i am thankful that you have found it . 
what else is love ? 
lie down right there . 
no . 
why , then . 
how does my juliet ? 
well then , i 'll say this quickly : the valiant paris desires you as his bride . 
then were you straight target . 
monday , my lord . 
were you talk of juliet ? 
don 't say nothing else . 
you know too much of distress . 
what ? 
where else should she be ? 
good morrow , gentlemen . 
you 'll find me apt enough to do so , sir , if you give me a cause . 
stand up . 
hold on , then . 
good night , good night . 
how doth she ? 
that 's foolish . 
why , is 't not jest , all this better than groaning of love ? 
hark , your romeo will be here tonight . 
hath romeo slew himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
you could not prevent her from dying but ever , but heaven will give her eternal life . 
trip , or i 'll cuff you on the ears with my sword before thou hast thine drawn . 
what , are you busy ? 
so did i. 
and trust me , love , you look pale to me too . 
thou shallow girl ! 
give me your hand . 
what art thou , girl ? 
was that my father who left here in such haste ? 
how does my wife ? 
use your cudgels and spears ! 
o my ! 
what is this ? 
this quarrel will first be who dies . 
tybalt is lying yonder . 
mine eyes were liars and swearers , then , for i never saw true beauty ere tonight . 
i have forgot why i call thee back . 
the citizens are about , and tybalt is dead . 
if there were two men like you , pretty soon there 'd be none for the two of you would kill each other . 
o , noise ? 
you shall feel the loss , but the man you weep for shall feel nothing . 
are you bound ? 
he struck me from under your arm . 
madam , your mother desires to speak to thee . 
don 't saints and pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other girl did not love me . 
i know 't , sir . 
beshrew your red ! 
teach me to forget to think ! 
why dost thou look so vexed ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it makes me mad . 
she 's lying underfoot even like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering . 
o , you 're deceived . 
o , away ! 
go to your chamber . 
benvolio is part of the montague strain . 
perchance she can 't find him . 
i do . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news . 
let 's go at it , coward ! 
let me keep weeping for such a great loss . 
i have my naked weapon out . 
wife ! 
and why , wise lady ? 
here comes the furious tybalt back again . 
you mean their cut off their heads , take their maidenheads-whatever . 
can 't you wait for an instant ? 
we 're undone , lady , we 're undone ! 
pray , young man ; do 't makes me angry . 
i will kiss thy lips . 
why should you do so , my love ? 
by nine o 'clock . 
gregory , remember how to slash . 
nurse , commend me to thy lady . 
girls younger than she oft wive and succession happy mothers . 
and , it 's good to have joy in such a joyless time . 
where do you come ? 
is my father well ? 
i hit hard when i 'm angry . 
o , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ? 
a greater power than we cannot fight has undone our story . 
then do my lips now have the vice they took from thine ? 
stop tears . 
it 's but even now nine o 'clock . 
o cousin , cousin ! 
what should i swear by ? 
well , we were all born to die . 
if he hears you , you 'll anger him . 
thou shouldst be able to endure this for the world is broad and wide . 
don 't you have one word of joy ? 
you , prince , are the man that can give me justice . 
therefore hence ! 
peace , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ? 
i 'll follow after . 
well , we may put off our pipes and go home . 
either put up your sword or use it to help me stop this quarrel . 
what , you do 't speak a word ? 
then she is well , and nothing is amiss . 
sweet , so do i. 
i swear , it must be thirty years . 
well , that one , i think , is young petruchio . 
wish me fortune . 
what 's the noise in here ? 
if i replied that question , i 'd be drives confession to you . 
she 's dead , like a fair flower , slain by an unseasonable frost . 
that ungentle rat ! 
what i 'm proverb can 't anger him . 
you 're a lover . 
my dream told me that dreamers often lie . 
but why , thou villain , didst thou kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then i 'll do give it you . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo slew tybalt . 
leave me and do what i told you to do . 
give me thy torch , boy . 
i 'm suddenly afeard . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous woman , a jealous woman ! 
what ? 
take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates . 
it 's all the same . 
i 've said nothing wrong . 
the excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself . 
destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men ! 
soft ! 
art thou biting your thumb at us ? 
i 'll bring you there . 
what ? 
well , you 're not on target there . 
it 's out of the fashion to give lengthy explanations like that . 
dost thou mean to begin a quarrel ? 
i 'll fight with you . 
tybalt , i have a cause to love you that lets me put away the rage of i should feel and excuse that abuse . 
my husband lives in earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven . 
i 'm lost in this world , i think . 
gentle mercutio , put up your sword . 
fie ! 
i will to stay more than i will to go . 
commend me to thy lady , and tell her to dispatch all in the house to bed . 
call him , mercutio . 
she 's too fair and too wise to serve heaven 's blessing by drives me herself . 
why , what 's tybalt 's tale ? 
two of the best endued with some stars in the whole sky had to go away on business , and they 're bid her eyes to twinkle in their places till they return . 
whether it 's even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of lammas eve , she 'll be fourteen . 
hast thou slain tybalt ? 
thou speakest well . 
romeo will thank you , my girl ; for both of us . 
if i live to see you marry but ever , all my will shall come true . 
tell us what you know this affair . 
i 'd give nothing to keep them from seeing you here . 
do you think it 's a good plot to haste ? 
what will you give us ? 
angry enough to run away . 
the right . 
there 's foison follow of time . 
my lord , you 're wrong to berate her so . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who began this quarrel ? 
take a little the vacation in of mantua . 
what would you ? 
sadness takes away our color . 
o , that most wicked fiend ! 
i would my sword . 
arise , man ! 
come hither , nurse . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and then it 's good night earnest . 
what 's the matter , juliet ? 
death , which hath taken her hence to make me weep , now ties up my tongue and won 't , let me speak . 
why dost thou stay ? 
who doth salute me so early in the morning ? 
there was never been so black a day as this . 
i see . 
why , let 's fight , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say of our marriage ? 
o life ! 
what villain , madam ? 
give my praises to thy lady . 
i shall miss 't any phrase send my love to thee . 
i 'm unseen wholly to keep the peace . 
may be god so jealous and detested ? 
and all things shall be why , i warrant you , wife . 
is the worst well ? 
o , pardon me for bringing this ill news , but you told me , it was my office , sir . 
i 've swallowed it out . 
what if this mingle does 't work at all ? 
i thought it was the right to do . 
is love indeed tender ? 
that 's for the murderer lives . 
good night . 
a woman more beautiful than the one i love ? 
not i , believe me . 
hold him in guard till the prince quit here . 
i will 't shame . 
o brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he bade me paris was about to marry juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i throw near thee in the chase for the goose ? 
it 's no time to play the right . 
away , and stay asunder from me . 
mistress ! 
is it young romeo ? 
bid her come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can any of you , tell me where i may find young romeo ? 
i 'm done . 
where are the charitable men , who began this quarrel ? 
then i rebel against thee , stars ! 
his drugs work quickly . 
i 'm biting my thumb at . 
peter ! 
here comes my man , the man i 'm seeking . 
why , what was thy dream ? 
thy mother is coming to your chamber . 
strike them ! 
go there and compare her objectively to some other girls i 'll show thee . 
ay , i know her age down to the hour . 
you will 't , then ? 
o wife , look how our daughter bleeds ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's already almost night . 
give me that pickax and the crowbar . 
o lord , they 're fighting ! 
my employer is as good as yours . 
come , come away .
