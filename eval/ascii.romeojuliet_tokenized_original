Villain am I none .
Give me , give me !
What , shall I groan and tell thee ?
Alack the day !
He was not born to shame .
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep , My dreams presage some joyful news at hand .
Either thou or I , or both , must go with him .
There lies the man , slain by young Romeo , That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath ?
O woeful , woeful , woeful day !
Come , vial .
And what to ?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray .
I would the fool were married to her grave !
No better .
Help me into some house , Benvolio , Or I shall faint .
Blind is his love and best befits the dark .
I am sped .
Ay , mine own fortune in my misery .
For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
O love !
Welcome from Mantua .
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
Welcome , gentlemen !
Stay the friar too .
The son and heir of old Tiberio .
Is he gone and hath nothing ?
May not one speak ?
Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .
I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they list .
Romeo will answer it .
My dismal scene I needs must act alone .
Madam , I am here .
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
As I did sleep under this yew tree here , I dreamt my master and another fought , And that my master slew him .
Is the day so young ?
Romeo can , Though heaven cannot .
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?
Thus with a kiss I die .
Take thou some new infection to thy eye , And the rank poison of the old will die .
I will carry no crotchets .
I would I were thy bird .
Any man that can write may answer a letter .
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?
Peter , stay at the gate .
Go tell him of this .
Faith , I know not what to say .
I will go call the watch .
What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?
Give me my sin again .
What is her mother ?
I will confess to you that I love him .
Young son , it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife , And all those twenty could but kill one life .
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .
Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
A man , young lady !
If love be blind , love cannot hit the mark .
Perhaps you have learned it without book .
Tybalt , my cousin !
Where the devil should this Romeo be ?
As I remember , this should be the house .
You are too hot .
Shame come to Romeo !
Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls ?
Who calls so loud ?
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave .
O woe !
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in .
Is it e 'en so ?
The time is very short .
But to be frank , and give it thee again .
Where is my mother ?
Monday !
To our house .
What hast thou found ?
Good even to my ghostly confessor .
Will you go to them ?
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .
Can I go forward when my heart is here ?
Look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .
What is the matter ?
A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
No , not till Thursday .
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .
Peace , you mumbling fool !
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am .
Tell me , daughter Juliet , How stands your disposition to be married ?
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .
Or shall we on without apology ?
Romeo , away , be gone !
Pitiful sight !
What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
By my heel , I care not .
Could you not take some occasion without giving ?
Tis he , that villain Romeo .
Need you my help ?
O me , O me !
Come , what says Romeo ?
His son was but a ward two years ago .
Nurse !
Take thou that .
What , lamb !
What , ho !
But now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?
We talk here in the public haunt of men .
In love ?
Without his roe , like a dried herring .
O Romeo , Romeo !
You lie .
Rest you merry !
I neither know it nor can learn of him .
No , my good lord .
The fee simple ?
What says Romeo ?
Saint Francis be my speed !
Good Romeo , hide thyself .
What counterfeit did I give you ?
I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
Father , what news ?
It is not yet near day .
So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .
Why , bride !
Have you delivered to her our decree ?
A challenge , on my life .
Well , peace be with you , sir .
Supper is done , and we shall come too late .
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .
What , art thou hurt ?
See where she comes from shrift with merry look .
Who bare my letter , then , to Romeo ?
Her vestal livery is but sick and green , And none but fools do wear it .
Tis late .
Do you not see that I am out of breath ?
Do as I bid thee , go .
An thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .
Is she not proud ?
O heavy day !
Do not deny to him that you love me .
How canst thou try them so ?
The boy gives warning something doth approach .
Why , may one ask ?
But come what sorrow can , It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight .
God mark thee to his grace !
Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
No , coz , I rather weep .
She will indite him to some supper .
Commend me to your daughter .
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?
Good morrow to you both .
Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
Henceforward do your messages yourself .
Wilt thou provoke me ?
Whither should they come ?
Ay , boy , ready .
O heavens !
Will it not be ?
Full half an hour .
Ready to go , but never to return .
Fear me not .
How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
Out on her , hilding !
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
O lamentable day !
That I ask again , For nothing can be ill if she be well .
Out upon you !
So thrive my soul- A thousand times good night !
What can he say in this ?
Wash they his wounds with tears ?
Up .
By my count , I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid .
What noise is this ?
O flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !
I do beseech you , sir , have patience .
Art thou a man ?
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
I hear some noise .
Quarrel , sir ?
Go thou to Juliet , help to deck up her .
Well , think of marriage now .
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
O rude unthankfulness !
So shalt thou show me friendship .
He is wise , And , on my life , hath stol 'n him home to bed .
Who knocks so hard ?
Ay , forsooth .
Look thou but sweet , And I am proof against their enmity .
I hear some noise within .
What , dost thou make us minstrels ?
Come hither , man .
Am I like such a fellow ?
Ay , ay , the cords .
I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
What further woe conspires against mine age ?
Whose house ?
Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .
Bliss be upon you !
Answer me like men .
God in heaven bless her !
I wot well where he is .
Down with the Montagues !
How long hath he been there ?
No matter .
Dost thou love me ?
O deadly sin !
The all-seeing sun Ne 'er saw her match since first the world begun .
And yet I wish but for the thing I have .
I know not .
Farewell !
Answer to that .
Send thy man away .
Some comfort , Nurse .
This is well .
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound ?
Wherefore storm you so ?
Now God in heaven bless thee !
That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .
Madam !
It was .
Go with me to the vault .
Your mother .
What say you ?
Down with the Capulets !
Who is it ?
I pray , sir , can you read ?
Amen !
My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
Farewell , my coz .
Why , she is within .
Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
Why the devil came you between us ?
Thou dost not mark me .
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me .
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
Where is my Romeo ?
Hark you , sir .
Hast thou met with him ?
These are news indeed !
A madness most discreet , A choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
Where is she ?
My fan , Peter .
I will go along .
No , sir .
Come , stir , stir , stir !
She speaks , yet she says nothing .
Ah me !
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .
Will you tell me that ?
But what say you to Thursday ?
This same should be the voice of Friar John .
Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .
Stay , Tybalt , stay !
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing .
Let me stand here till thou remember it .
I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale .
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
Said he not so ?
Take it in what sense thou wilt .
Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .
Hang him , Jack !
Nurse ?
Good heart , at what ?
Is your man secret ?
What ?
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken .
The what ?
I will say for you .
Now do you know the reason of this haste .
It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
You are a saucy boy .
I do remember well where I should be , And there I am .
An eagle , madam , Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye As Paris hath .
Unhappy fortune !
Not proud you have , but thankful that you have .
What is it else ?
Lie thou there .
No .
Well , sir .
How fares my Juliet ?
Thus then in brief : The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .
A right good markman !
Monday , my lord .
Spakest thou of Juliet ?
Talk no more .
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company .
What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
Where should she be ?
God ye good morrow , gentlemen .
You shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .
Stand up .
Hold , then .
Good night , good night !
How is it with her ?
O simple !
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night .
Hath Romeo slain himself ?
On Thursday , sir ?
Your part in her you could not keep from death , But heaven keeps his part in eternal life .
Make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .
What , are you busy , ho ?
And so did I.
And trust me , love , in my eye so do you .
Out , you baggage !
Give me thy hand .
How now ?
Was that my father that went hence so fast ?
How doth my lady ?
Clubs , bills , and partisans !
O me !
What is this ?
This shall determine that .
There lies that Tybalt .
For I ne 'er saw true beauty till this night .
I have forgot why I did call thee back .
The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain .
Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .
Yea , noise ?
So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .
Wilt thou be gone ?
I was hurt under your arm .
Madam , your mother craves a word with you .
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
The other did not so .
I know not , sir .
Your houses !
O , teach me how I should forget to think !
Why dost thou wring thy hands ?
Madam , I am not well .
It makes me mad .
Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
O , be gone !
Hie to your chamber .
This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .
Perchance she cannot meet him .
I have .
Tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .
Have at thee , coward !
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
My naked weapon is out .
Wife !
And why , my Lady Wisdom ?
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .
Can you not stay awhile ?
We are undone , lady , we are undone !
I beseech thee , youth , Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury .
I will kiss thy lips .
For what purpose , love ?
By the hour of nine .
You know not what you do .
Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .
Younger than she are happy mothers made .
And joy comes well in such a needy time .
Whence come you ?
Is my father well ?
I strike quickly , being moved .
O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents .
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .
Then weep no more .
But new struck nine .
O cousin , cousin !
What shall I swear by ?
Well , we were born to die .
An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
Be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
Hast thou not a word of joy ?
I beg for justice , which thou , Prince , must give .
Hence , be gone , away !
Peace , ho , for shame !
Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?
I will follow you .
Faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .
Put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .
What , not a word ?
Then she is well , and nothing can be ill .
Sweet , so would I.
By 'r Lady , thirty years .
Marry , that , I think , be young Petruchio .
Hie to high fortune !
What noise is here ?
To answer that , I should confess to you .
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field .
Scurvy knave !
This cannot anger him .
You are a lover .
That dreamers often lie .
But wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
Madam , good night .
I will then give it you soundly .
Give me those flowers .
Romeo slew him ; he slew Mercutio .
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do .
Give me thy torch , boy .
Fear comes upon me .
Here comes your father .
A jealous hood , a jealous hood !
For what , I pray thee ?
Away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate .
Tis all one .
I speak no treason .
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men !
Soft !
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
I will bring you thither .
What of that ?
Well , in that hit you miss .
The date is out of such prolixity .
Do you quarrel , sir ?
I am for you .
Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting .
My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .
I am peppered , I warrant , for this world .
Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .
Fie , fie !
I have more care to stay than will to go .
Commend me to thy lady , And bid her hasten all the house to bed , Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .
Call , good Mercutio .
She is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , To merit bliss by making me despair .
Why , what is Tybalt ?
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , Having some business , do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return .
Even or odd , of all days in the year , Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
Hast thou slain Tybalt ?
You say well .
Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
An I might live to see thee married once , I have my wish .
Then say at once what thou dost know in this .
I would not for the world they saw thee here .
Do you like this haste ?
What will you give us ?
But thou art not quickly moved to strike .
Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .
There is time enough .
You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
Farewell .
Benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?
Sojourn in Mantua .
What is your will ?
Dry sorrow drinks our blood .
O most wicked fiend !
My sword , I say !
What , rouse thee , man !
Come hither , Nurse .
Come , death , and welcome !
Three words , dear Romeo , and good night indeed .
Why , how now , Juliet ?
Death , that hath ta 'en her hence to make me wail , Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
Why dost thou stay ?
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?
Never was seen so black a day as this .
Ye say honestly .
Then have at thee , boy !
Romeo .
What says he of our marriage ?
O life !
What villain , madam ?
Commend me to thy lady .
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
I do but keep the peace .
Can heaven be so envious ?
Tush , I will stir about , And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife .
Yea , is the worst well ?
O , pardon me for bringing these ill news , Since you did leave it for my office , sir .
So ho !
What if this mixture do not work at all ?
I thought all for the best .
Is love a tender thing ?
That is because the traitor murderer lives .
Good night .
One fairer than my love ?
Not I , believe me .
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither .
I will not fail .
O brother Montague , give me thy hand .
We found him in the churchyard .
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet .
Romeo !
Was I with you there for the goose ?
Tis no time to play now .
Hence , and stand aloof .
Mistress !
Young Romeo is it ?
Call her forth to me .
Look , and thou shalt see .
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?
I have it , And soundly too .
Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
Then I defy you , stars !
Thy drugs are quick .
I do bite my thumb , sir .
Peter !
Here comes my man .
Well , what was yours ?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber .
Strike !
Go thither , and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .
Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .
You will not then ?
O wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
Romeo is coming .
Tis now near night .
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .
O Lord , they fight !
I serve as good a man as you .
Come , come away .
