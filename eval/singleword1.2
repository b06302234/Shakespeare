i am not a villain . 
give it to me ! 
what , shall i groan and tell you ? 
she 's dead , pitiful day ! 
he was not born to shame . 
if i may trust what happens while i sleep , my dreams predict some joyful news is coming . 
either you or i , or both of us , must go with him . 
there lies the man slain by young romeo , that killed your kinsman , brave mercutio . 
how are you out of breath , when you have breath to say to me that you are out of breath ? 
o woeful , woeful , woeful day ! 
come , vial . 
and to what ? 
i am very happy he wasn 't at this fight . 
i wish the foolish girl were married to her grave ! 
no better ? 
help me into some house , benvolio , or i shall faint . 
his love is blind and it sorts the dark best . 
i am finished . 
yes , my own worth in my misery . 
for doting , not for loving , my pupil . 
o love ! 
welcome from mantua . 
i will bite you on the ear for that joke ! 
welcome , gentlemen ! 
hold the friar too . 
the son and heir of old tiberio . 
is he gone , and he has nothing ? 
can 't someone speak ? 
by mary , sir , because silver has a sweet sound . 
let them take it whatever way they will . 
romeo will answer it . 
i must act my dreadful scene alone . 
madam , i am here . 
now , before god , i am so annoyed that every part about me quivers . 
as i was sleeping under this tree , that my master and fought , and that my master killed him another yew here i dreamed . 
good morning , cousin is it morning ? 
romeo can , though heaven cannot . 
what devil are you that torments me like this ? 
so , i die with a kiss . 
take some new infection to your eye , and the rank poison of the old love will die . 
i won 't any hooked instruments . 
i wish i were your bird . 
any man that can write may answer a letter . 
did a dragon ever keep so beautiful a cave ? 
don 't you letters to me from the friar ? 
peter , stay at the gate . 
go tell him about this . 
faith , i know what to say don 't . 
i 'll go call the guards . 
what we are going to give as our excuse ? 
give me my sin again . 
who is her mother ? 
i will confess to you that i love him . 
young son , it is a distempered head that bids good morning to your bed so soon arguably . 
some of them fought in this black fight , and all those twenty only take life one could twenty . 
in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman . 
search , seek , and know how this foul murder betid . 
a man , young lady ! 
if love is blind , love can 't find the soil . 
perhaps you have learned it without book . 
tybalt , my cousin ! 
where the devil can this be romeo ? 
as i remember , this should be the house . 
you are too hot under the collar . 
shame come to romeo ! 
tell me , my good friend , what torch is over there that wastes giving his light to grubs and eyeless skulls ? 
who is calling so loudly ? 
every one should prepare to follow this beautiful corpse to her grave . 
o woe ! 
now he is for the numbers that petrarch flowed in ! 
is it so ? 
that 's very soon . 
only to be honest and give it to you again . 
where is my mother ? 
monday ! 
to supper ; to our house . 
what have you found ? 
good evening to my ghostly confessor . 
will you go to them ? 
you can 't speak about something you don feel 't . 
can i go home when my heart is here ? 
look , sir , here the lady is coming toward my cell . 
yes , madam , from the danger of my hands . 
what 's the matter ? 
a right fair mark , coz , is the first hit fair . 
no , not until thursday . 
as much to him , otherwise his thanks is too much . 
peace , you mumbling fool ! 
by a name that i know how to tell you who i am don 't . 
tell me , daughter juliet , what do you think about getting married ? 
you were never with me for anything when you were not there for the goose . 
or shall we go just on without any apology ? 
romeo , leave , be gone ! 
pitiful sight ! 
what , will you wash him from his grave with tears ? 
by my heel , i care not . 
couldn 't you take some opportunity without my giving you one ? 
it is he , that villain , romeo . 
do you need my help ? 
o me , o me ! 
come , what does romeo say ? 
his son was but a ward two years ago . 
nurse ! 
you take that . 
what , lamb ! 
what , hello ! 
but now , my lord , what say you to my request ? 
we 're talking here in a public place . 
in love ? 
without his fish eggs , like a dried herring . 
o romeo , romeo ! 
you 're a liar ! 
have a nice day ! 
don i know 't and he won 't tell me . 
no , my good lord . 
the inherited estate ! 
what does romeo say ? 
saint francis be my speed ! 
good romeo , hide yourself . 
what false impression did i give you ? 
i am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse name . 
father , what news ? 
it 's not morning yet . 
so will you confess , i am sure , that you love me . 
why , bride ! 
have you told her what we have decided for her ? 
a challenge , on my life . 
well , peace be with you , sir . 
supper is done , and we shall come too late . 
you will not move one foot to fight ! 
what , are you hurt ? 
see how she comes from confession with a happy face . 
the , who took my letter to romeo ? 
her honest , white gown is sick and green , and only fools wear it only . 
it 's late . 
don 't you see that i 'm out of breath ? 
go , do what i have told you . 
if you make us musicians , look to hear nothing but noise . 
isn 't she proud ? 
o heavy day ! 
don 't deny to him that you love me . 
how can watch them ? 
the boy gives the warning is something approaching . 
why , may one ask ? 
but sorrow can come , it cannot even the exchange of joy that one minute in her sight gives me short whatever . 
god mark you for his grace ! 
do so , and bid my sweet to prepare to rate me . 
no , cousin , i 'd rather cry . 
she will give him a written invitation to some supper . 
commend me to your daughter . 
don 't you bring me letters from the friar ? 
good morning to you both . 
hurry up , make haste , for it grows very late . 
from this time forward , do your messages yourself . 
will you still provoke me ? 
where should they come ? 
yes , boy , ready . 
o heaven ! 
what , you 're suited ! 
a full half hour . 
ready to go , but never to return . 
don 't worry about me . 
how should they , when wise men have no eyes ? 
throw her out , the good for nothing ! 
they 're asking for dates and quinces in the pastry . 
o lamentable day ! 
i 'll ask that again ; for nothing can be wrong an she is well . 
shame on you ! 
i 'll be waiting , a thousand times good night ! 
what can he say about this ? 
they wash his wounds with tears . 
up . 
by my tell i was your mother old close to the age that you are now . 
what 's going on ? 
o flesh , flesh , how are you fishified ! 
i beg you , sir , have patience . 
are you a man ? 
if i were so easy as you are any man should buy the estate of my life for an hour and a quarter , to square inherited . 
i hear some noise . 
fight , sir ! 
you go to juliet , help her ready . 
well , think of marriage now . 
yes , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . 
o rude unthankfulness ! 
this way you show me friendship . 
he is wise ; and , on my life , he has stolen home to bed . 
who knocks so hard ? 
yes , she did really . 
if you will just look sweet , then i am protected against their hate . 
i hear some noise within . 
what , do you make us musicians ? 
come here , man . 
am i like such a fellow ? 
yes , yes , the ropes . 
i 'll go , sir , and not trouble you . 
what additional sorrow conspires against my old age ? 
whose house ? 
no , gentle romeo , we must have you dance . 
blessings on you ! 
answer me like men . 
god in heaven bless her ! 
i know well where he is . 
down with the montagues ! 
how long he has been in there ? 
no matter . 
do you love me ? 
o deadly sin ! 
the sun all-seeing never saw her since the world first began to match anything . 
and still i wish but for the thing that i have already . 
don i know 't . 
farewell ! 
answer that . 
send your man away . 
give me some comfort , nurse . 
this is old . 
was there ever a book containing such vile matter so beautifully bound ? 
why do you storm so ? 
now god in heaven bless you ! 
you may call me that , sir , when i may be a wife . 
madam ! 
it was . 
go with me to the tomb . 
your mother . 
what do you say ? 
down with the capulets ! 
who is it ? 
good day.-please tell me , sir , can you read ? 
amen ! 
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ? 
farewell , my coz . 
why , she 's inside . 
or , if he wrote his mind , give me his letter . 
to romeo &ket; why the devil did you come between us ? 
don 't you understand me . 
therefore , he that cannot lick his fingers won 't come back with me . 
who now owes the price of his dear blood ? 
where is my romeo ? 
listen , sir . 
have you met with him ? 
this news is indeed ! 
a most madness discreet , a choking acid , and a preserving sweet . 
where is she ? 
my fan , peter . 
i 'll go along . 
no , sir . 
come on , let 's get going ! 
she speaks , but she says nothing . 
ah me ! 
your plantain-leaf is virtuous for that . 
will you tell me that ? 
but what do you say to thursday ? 
this is the voice of friar john . 
what do you want to do , because i 'm finished with you . 
wait , tybalt , wait ! 
but i should kill you with much cherishing . 
let me stand here until you remember . 
i will be brief , for i don 't have enough breath to this tedious tale . 
let me argue with you about your situation . 
did he say it ? 
take it any way you like . 
yeah , by my truth , the case may be amended . 
the hell with him , jack ! 
nurse ? 
good heart , at what ? 
can your man keep a secret ? 
what ? 
the prince will sentence you to death if you are taken prisoner . 
the what ? 
i will say it for you . 
now you know why we 're in a hurry . 
it is the lark that sings so out of tune , straining to sing horrible songs and unpleasing notes . 
you are a saucy knave . 
i remember well where i should be , and here i am . 
an eagle , madam , is not as green , as swift , and hasn 't so beautiful an eye as paris has . 
very bad luck ! 
i 'm not proud that you have , but i 'm thankful that you have . 
what else is it ? 
you lie there . 
no . 
well , sir . 
how fares my juliet ? 
thus , then , here it is ; the valiant paris seeks you for his love . 
a right good marksman ! 
monday , my lord . 
did you speak of juliet ? 
talk no more . 
my dear son is too familiar with such sour company . 
what , is your sword out among these unpregnant servants ? 
where should she be ? 
good morning , gentlemen . 
you shall find me easy enough for that , sir , if you will give me the opportunity . 
stand up . 
stay , then . 
good night , good night ! 
how is it with her ? 
o how true ! 
why , isn 't this better now than groaning for love ? 
you listen : your romeo will be here at night . 
has romeo killed himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
your part in her you could not keep from death , but heaven keeps his part in eternal life . 
hurry up , for fear my sword will be about your ears before you get yours out . 
what , are you busy , hello ? 
and so did i. 
and trust me , love , in my eyes , so do you . 
out , you bag of garbage ! 
give me your hand . 
what 's going on ? 
that was my father that went away so fast ? 
how is my lady doing ? 
clubs , pikes , and more pikes ! 
o me ! 
what is this ? 
this fight shall determine that . 
there lies that same tybalt . 
for i never saw very fair till this night . 
i have forgotten why i called you back . 
the citizens are up , and tybalt is dead . 
no , if there were two such fellows , we should have none shortly , because one would kill the other . 
yes , noise ? 
you 'll feel the loss , but not the loss of the friend you weep for . 
you are going ? 
i was hurt under your arm . 
madam , your mother craves a word with you . 
don 't saints and holy pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other one didn 't . 
i know not , sir . 
your houses ! 
o , teach me how i should forget to think . 
why are you wringing your hands ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it makes me angry . 
she lies the same way , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering . 
otherwise , you would have made your tale large . 
o , go away ! 
hurry to your chamber . 
this is the truth , or let benvolio die . 
maybe she can 't meet him . 
i have . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it from you . 
fight me , coward ! 
let me weep for feeling such a loss . 
it 's out already ! 
wife ! 
and why are you butting in , my lady wit ? 
here comes the furious tybalt back again . 
yes , the heads of maids , or their virginity . 
can 't you rest awhile ? 
we are ruined , lady , we are ruined ! 
i beg , youth , don 't put on my head by me to fight urging sin you another . 
i will kiss your lips . 
why , love ? 
at nine . 
don 't you know what you 're doing ! 
nurse , commend me to your lady and mistress . 
younger girls than she are made happy mothers . 
and joy is welcomed in such a needy time . 
where do you come from ? 
is my father well ? 
i can hit quickly , if i 'm motivated . 
o , will you leave me so unsatisfied ? 
a greater power than we can contradict has opposed our plans . 
then , do my lips have the sin that they have taken from yours ? . 
so stop crying . 
it 's 9 am . 
o cousin , cousin ! 
what shall i swear by ? 
well , we were born to die . 
if he hears you , you will make him angry . 
be patient , for the world is broad and wide . 
don 't you have any word of joy ? 
i beg for justice , which you , prince , must give ; romeo killed tybalt . 
get going , get out of here , leave ! 
peace , ho , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way he did run ? 
i will follow you . 
in faith , we may put up our pipes and go home . 
put your sword away , or use it to help me break up this fight . 
what , not a word ? 
then she is well , and nothing can be wrong . 
sweet , so do i. 
by our lady , thirty years . 
by mary , that , i think , is young petruchio . 
go quickly to high speed ! 
what noise is here ? 
to answer that question , i should confess to you . 
death lies on her like an untimely frost on the sweetest flower in all the fields . 
scurvy knave ! 
this cannot anger him . 
i cannot move . 
that dreamers often lie . 
but why , villain , did you kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then , i 'll give it to you as payment . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo killed him ; he killed mercutio . 
leave me , and do as i ask you . 
give me your torch , boy . 
fear comes over me . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous spy , a jealous spy ! 
for what , like tell me ? 
away with the good stools , remove the china closet , look to the plate . 
makes no difference . 
i 'm not telling a lie . 
the excuse that you make in this delay is longer than the tale you excuse . 
o mischief , you are quick to enter into the thoughts of desperate men ! 
what ! 
did you give the finger to us , sir ? 
i will bring you there . 
what does that mean ? 
well , in that hit , you miss . 
the time is of such a boring duration . 
are you picking a fight with us , sir ? 
i am for you . 
tybalt , the reason that i have to love you excuse very much the rage that is for such a greeting appropriate does . 
my husband is on earth , my faith in heaven . 
i am not long , i guarantee , for this world . 
gentle mercutio , put up your sword . 
for shame , for shame ! 
i have more care to stay than will to go . 
commend me to thy lady ; and bid her hurry to the whole house to bed , which makes them likely to do more heavy sorrow . 
call him , good mercutio . 
she is fair , too wise ; wisely too fair , to her own happiness by making me despair earn too . 
why , what is tybalt ? 
two of the fairest stars in heaven , having some business , do beg her eyes twinkle in their sockets till the stars . return to all the 
couple of days , of all the year , the middle of july , she 'll be fourteen days or not in come . 
you have killed tybalt ? 
you say well . 
romeo shall thank you , daughter , for us both . 
if i live to see you married , i have my wish . 
then tell what you can about all of this . 
i have them see you here for the world wouldn 't . 
do you like this speed ? 
what will you give us ? 
but you 're not quickly motivated to hit . 
no , i am the very small soil of courtesy . 
there 's plenty of time . 
you are to blame , my lord , to berate her like this . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who began this bloody fight ? 
travel to mantua . 
what is do you need ? 
dry sorrow drinks our blood . 
o most wicked evil , woman ! 
my sword , i say ! 
what , wake up , man ! 
come here , nurse . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . 
why , how are you , juliet ? 
death , that has taken away to make me up my tongue and will not let me speak , her wail ties . 
why do you stay ? 
what early tongue so sweetly salutes me ? 
a day as black as this has been never seen ! 
you speak honestly . 
then , i 'll get you , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say about our marriage ? 
o life ! 
what villain , madam ? 
commend me to your lady . 
i won miss 't a chance to send you my greetings , love . 
i 'm only trying to keep the peace . 
heaven can be so jealous ? 
i will work it out , and everything will be old , i guarantee you , wife . 
yeah , is the worst well ? 
o , forgive me for bringing you this news , since you did leave it all up to me , sir sad . 
so ho ! 
what if this mixture doesn 't work at all ? 
i thought it was for all the best . 
love is a tender thing ? 
that is because the traitor murderer lives . 
good night . 
one fairer than my love ? 
not me , believe me . 
hold him in safety until the prince arrives . 
i will not fail ! 
o brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he told me paris was going to marry juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i with you there for the goose ? 
this is no time to play . 
go away , and stand over there . 
mistress ! 
young romeo , is it ? 
call her to come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can you tell me where i may find the young any of romeo ? 
i have had it , and soundly too . 
where are the wicked beginners of this fight ? 
then , i defy you , stars ! 
your drugs are quick . 
i did give the finger , sir . 
peter ! 
here comes my man . 
well , what was yours ? 
your lady mother is coming to your bedroom . 
strike ! 
let 's go , and , with a clear eye , like her face that i shall show you , and i will make you think your is a crow swan with some others . 
believe me , i can tell her age to the hour . 
you won 't play then ? 
o wife , look how our daughter bleeds ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's almost night now . 
give me that chisel-edged pick and the iron wrench . 
o lord , they 're fighting ! 
i work for as good a man as you do . 
come , come away !
