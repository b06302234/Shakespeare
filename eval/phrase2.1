tybalt is lying yond . 
my eyes were liars , then , for i never saw very fair or tonight . 
i have forgotten why i called you again . 
the citizens are abroad , and tybalt is dead . 
if there were two men with you , pretty there 'd be none for the two of you would kill each other by and by . 
o , cry ? 
you will pass the loss , but the man you weep for will pass nothing . 
you are going ? 
he struck me from under your arm . 
madam , your mother wants to speak with you . 
don 't saints and palmers have lips too ? 
the other she did not love me . 
don i know 't , sir . 
beshrew your families ! 
teach me to forget to know ! 
why do you think so wild ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it gives me mad . 
she 's lying in the ground but with him , and weeping , blubbering weeping and blubbering . 
o , you 're out . 
o , go away ! 
go to your chamber . 
benvolio is kind of the montague name . 
perchance she can 't like him . 
i do . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news . 
let 's go in it , coward ! 
let me stay weeping of such a great loss . 
i have my naked sword out . 
fellow ! 
and why , grave she ? 
here comes the wild tybalt back again . 
you think their cut off their heads , have their maidenheads-whatever . 
can 't you look for a charge ? 
we 're undone , lady , we 're undone ! 
like , young man , don give 't me out . 
i will kiss your lips . 
why would you do that , my love ? 
for nine o 'clock . 
gregory , know how to slash . 
nurse , make my desire to to your lady . 
girls younger than she oft bride and be happy dames . 
it 's good to have comfort in such a joyless day and . 
where do you come from ? 
is my father well ? 
i take much that i 'm out . 
o , you are going to leave me so unsatisfied ? 
a more power than we can speak has lost our purpose . 
then make my lips now have they took the fall of yours ? 
stand crying . 
it 's all nine o 'clock now . 
o cousin , cousin ! 
what should i take in ? 
well , we were all born to die . 
and he hears you , you 'll make him out . 
you should be able to stand for this time is large and wide . 
don 't you have one word in joy ? 
you , prince , are the man who can make me justice . 
so take of here ! 
be quiet , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way he did run ? 
i 'll continue you . 
well , we can shut up our pipes and go home . 
either shut up your sword or lay it to help me leave this war . 
what , ye don 't say a word ? 
then she is fair , and nothing is out . 
my sweet , so do i. 
i swear , it must be thirty years . 
well , that one , i think , is young petruchio . 
will me hap . 
what 's all the noise of here ? 
and i returned that sound , i 'd be making confession to you . 
she 's dead , with a fair flower , dead with an unseasonable frost . 
that brock ! 
what i 'm word can 't blood him . 
you 're a friend . 
my dream told me that dreamers often lodge . 
but why , you slave , did you kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then i 'll make it good to you . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo dead tybalt . 
leave me and do what i told you to do . 
give me your torch , boy . 
i 'm suddenly afeard . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous woman , a jealous woman ! 
what ? 
take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates . 
it 's all the same . 
i 've said nothing out . 
the answer you make to stay the news is longer than the noise itself . 
fell thoughts make ready to the minds of desperate men ! 
stand . 
are you sudden your thumb in 's ? 
i 'll bring you there . 
so what ? 
well , you 're not a mark there . 
it 's out of fashion to make lingering reasons with that . 
are you trying to meet a war ? 
i 'll speak you . 
i have a cause to love you that lets me lay by the spirit i should pass and answer that wrong . tybalt , 
my husband is quick in earth , my vows of marriage are of heaven . 
i 'm done to in this world , i trust . 
great mercutio , put your sword away . 
shame on you ! 
i care for a go more than i care for to go . 
make my desire to your lady , and bring her to haste everybody of the house to bed . 
write to him , mercutio . 
she 's too fair and too wise to win heaven 's blessing in making me despair . 
why , what 's tybalt 's argument ? 
two of the brightest stars in the heavens had to go away in question , and they 're asking her eyes to twinkle of their offices till that they return . full 
it 's even or odd , of all the days of the year of the night of lammas eve , she 'll be fourteen . , and 
have you dead tybalt ? 
you say well . 
romeo will thank you , my girl , to both of us . 
as i live to see you take married someday , all my wishes will verify . 
tell us what you know of this business . 
i 'd give aught to keep them from seeing you here . 
do you think it 's a good conceit to fly ? 
what will you make us ? 
hot enough to run away . 
the good . 
there 's old time . 
my lord , you 're out a tongue her with that . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who offered this war ? 
have a little vacation in mantua . 
what do you care for ? 
weight takes away our color . 
o , that most heavy fiend ! 
i care for my sword . 
rise , sir ! 
come over here , dame . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and then it 's good night to good . 
what 's going on , juliet ? 
death , which has taken away to make me cry , now knits up my tongue and let me speak 't won her . 
why are you waiting ? 
who greets me so betimes ? 
there has been never so black a day to today . 
i see . 
alright , let 's stand , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say of our marriage ? 
o world ! 
what villain , madam ? 
make my commendation to your lady . 
i won 't lack any chance to turn my love to you . 
i 'm but trying to keep the peace . 
can god be so jealous and hateful ? 
and everything will be , i warrant you , half alright . 
is the worst well ? 
o , pardon me of this ill news , but you told me it was my hand , sir bringing . 
i 've found it out . 
what 's that mixture doesn 't hand at all ? 
i thought it was the good thing to do . 
is like good gentle ? 
that 's as the murderer is alive . 
good night . 
a woman more beautiful than the one i love ? 
not me , take me . 
give him up till that the prince takes here . 
i won 't fall . 
o , brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he told me paris was about to marry juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i meet against you in the course of the goose ? 
it 's not the good day to play . 
go away and go apart of me . 
love ! 
is it young romeo ? 
bring her to come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can you tell me where i can find out young in any romeo ? 
i 'm done to . 
where are the ill men who offered this war ? 
then i cry of you , stars ! 
his medicine hand ready . 
i 'm sudden my thumb . 
peter ! 
here comes my man , the man i 'm looking of . 
well , what was your dream ? 
your mother is coming to your chamber . 
take them ! 
go and set her to some other girls i 'll show you there coldly . 
yes , i know her time down to the day . 
you won 't , then ? 
o fellow , like a how our daughter bloods ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's first like night . 
give me that pickax and the crow . 
o lord , they 're rage ! 
my manager is as good as yours . 
come , come away .
