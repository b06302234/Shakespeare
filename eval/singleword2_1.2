as i was sleeping under this yew tree here , i dreamed that my master and another fought , and that my master killed him . 
good morrow , cousin is it morning ? 
romeo can , though heaven cannot . 
what devil are you that torments me with this ? 
so , i die with a kiss . 
take some new fire to your eye , and the place dram of the old love will die .

give me my fault again . 
who is her mother ? 
i will confess to you that i love him . 
young son , it is arguably a distempered crown that bids good morrow so soon at your bed . 
some twenty of them fought in this black stand , and all those twenty could but have some time . 
of weight , cousin , i do love a woman . 
search , look , and know how this foul murder happened . 
a man , young lady ! 
as love is blind , love can 't like the o . 
belike you have learned it without book .

as i guess , this should be the house . 
you are too hot under the band . 
shame come to romeo ! 
tell me , good my friend , what torch is over there that wears giving his day to grubs and eyeless faces ? 
who is way so deeply ? 
every one should prepare to keep this fair corse to her grave . 
o woe ! 
now he is of the numbers as petrarch flowed of ! 
is it so ? 
that 's too soon . 
but to be honest and give it to you again . 
where is my mother ?

you can 't come of something you don 't pass . 
can i go home that my heart is here ? 
look , sir , here the lady is coming toward my hold . 
yes , madam , of the measure of my hands . 
what 's the matter ? 
a good fair note , fair coz , is the first take . 
no , not until thursday . 
as much to him , else his thanks is too much . 
peace , you mumbling fool ! 
for a name that i don 't know how to tell you who i am . 
tell me , daughter juliet , what do you think of getting married ? 
you were never with me to aught that you were not there for the goose . 
or shall we but go in without any apology ? 
romeo , fly , be gone ! 
pitiful eye ! 
what , will you wash him of his grave with tears ? 
by my heel , i care not . 
couldn 't you have some way out my gift you one ? 
it is he , that villain , romeo . 
do you turn my back ? 
o me , o me !

his son was but a ward two years ago . 
dame ! 
you have that . 
what , lamb ! 
what , hello ! 
but now , my lord , what say you to my request ? 
we 're tale here in a common sort . 
in love ? 
but his fish eggs , like a dry herring . 
o romeo , romeo ! 
you 're a liar !

i don 't wit and he won 't tell me . 
no , my good lord . 
the inherited state ! 
what does romeo word ? 
saint francis be my speed ! 
good romeo , shroud yourself . 
what false persuasion did i give you ? 
i am the youngest of that name , to fall in a worse title . 
father , what news ? 
it 's not morning yet . 
so will you confess , i am sure , that you love me . 
why , bride ! 
have you told her what we have made to her ? 
a brave , by my life .

supper is done , and we shall come too late . 
you will not touch one foot to fight ! 
what , are you suffer ? 
look how she makes of confession of a kind answer . 
the , who took my letter to romeo ? 
her honest , white gown is but sick and green , and all fools wear it . 
it 's late . 
don 't you look as i 'm out of breath ? 
go , do what i have told you . 
if you give us music , like to hear nothing but cry . 
isn 't she proud ? 
o heavy day ! 
don 't face to him that you love me . 
how can keep them ? 
the boy lends the advice something is present . 
why , may one desire ? 
but however sorrow can make , it cannot like the change of joy that some low minute of her eye makes me . 
god mark you to his grace ! 
do so , and bid my sweet to prepare to rate me . 
no , cousin , i 'd rather cry . 
she will make him a written offer to some supper . 
commend me to your daughter . 
don 't you bring me letters from the friar ? 
good morrow to you both . 
haste up , make haste , for it comes too late . 
from this time forth , like your messengers yourself . 
will you still move me ? 
where should they come ? 
yes , boy , content . 
o heaven ! 
what , you 're ready ! 
a great half hour . 
ready to go , but never to answer . 
don 't care of me . 
how should they , that wise men have no eyes ? 
throw her out , the good of nothing ! 
they 're asking for tides and quinces of the paste . 
o lamentable day ! 
i 'll ask but again ; for nothing can be false as she is well . 
shame on you ! 
i 'll be waiting , a thousand times good night ! 
what can he say of this ? 
they wash his wounds with tears . 
up . 
by my account i was your mother pretty hard to the time that you are now . 
what 's going on ? 
o flesh , flesh , how are you fishified ! 
i cry you , sir , have patience . 
are you a man ? 
if i were all ready to question as you are , any man should buy the inherited possession of my life for an hour and a country . 
i hear some cry . 
speak , sir ! 
you go to juliet , comfort her ready . 
well , think of marriage now . 
yes , pilgrim , lips that they must use of prayer . 
o rude unkindness ! 
this place you give me favour . 
he is wise ; and , by my life , he has stolen home to bed . 
who knocks so much ? 
yes , she good did . 
if you will but like sweet , then i am blessed of their hate . 
i hear some noise in . 
what , do you make us music ? 
come hither , sir .

yes , yes , the ropes . 
i 'll go , sir , and not trouble you . 
what overplus thought practises of my old time ? 
whose house ? 
no , gentle romeo , we must have you dance . 
blessings on you ! 
answer me with men . 
god of heaven bless her ! 
i know well where he is . 
down with the montagues ! 
how long has he been in there ? 
no matter . 
do you love me ? 
o fell fault ! 
the all-seeing fire never saw aught to set her for the time first can . 
and yet i will but to the thing that i first have . 
i don 't wit . 
farewell ! 
answer that . 
turn your man away . 
give me some comfort , keeper . 
this is much . 
was there ever a book containing such vile stuff so fair fast ? 
why do you charge so ? 
now god of heaven bless you ! 
you may call me that , sir , that i may be a wife . 
madam ! 
it was . 
go with me to the monument . 
your mother . 
what do you say ? 
down with the capulets ! 
who is it ? 
good day.-please tell me , sir , can you read ? 
amen ! 
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ? 
farewell , my coz . 
why , she 's entrails . 
or , if he wrote his wit , give me his letter . 
a romeo &ket; why the devil did you make of us ? 
ye don 't have me . 
therefore , he that cannot lick his fingers won 't come again with me . 
who now owes the price of his dear blood ? 
where is my romeo ? 
list , sir . 
have you met with him ? 
this is news indeed ! 
a rage most wise , a choking eager , and a preserving sweet . 
where is she ? 
my fan , peter . 
i 'll go along . 
no , sir . 
come on , let 's take dispatch ! 
she speaks , but she says nothing . 
ah me ! 
your plantain-leaf is fair of that . 
will you tell me that ? 
but what do say you to thursday ? 
this is the breath of friar john . 
do what you occasion to do , as i 'm out of you . 
stay , tybalt , stand ! 
but i should pay you with much cherishing . 
let me rest here until you know . 
i will be brief , for i don 't have enough breath to this heavy tale . 
let me plead with you of your estate . 
did he say it ? 
take it any place you with . 
yeah , by my troth , the case may be mended . 
the hell of him , jack ! 
dame ? 
good heart , in what ? 
can your he stay a secret ? 
what ? 
the prince will doom you a death as you are taken prisoner . 
the what ? 
i will tell it to you . 
now you know why we 're of a haste . 
it is the lark that sings so out of tune , straining to sing horrible notes and unpleasing bills . 
you are a saucy knave . 
i know well where i should be , and here i am . 
an eagle , madam , is not to ground , as free , and hasn 't so fair an eye to paris has . 
very ill luck ! 
i 'm not proud that you have , but i 'm thankful that you have . 
what else is it ? 
you lie there . 
no . 
well , sir . 
how fares my juliet ? 
this , then , here it is ; the great paris looks you to his love . 
a good good shot ! 
monday , my lord . 
did you speak of juliet ? 
come no more . 
my dear son is too familiar with such eager cry . 
what , is your sword out within these giddy people ? 
where should she be ? 
good morrow , gentlemen . 
you shall find me light enough for that , sir , if you will give me the way . 
stand up . 
go , then . 
good night , good night ! 
how is it with her ? 
o how true ! 
why , isn 't this better now than groaning to love ? 
you list : your romeo will be here at night . 
has romeo dead himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
your part of her you could not hold of death , but heaven holds his part of eternal time . 
haste up , for fear my sword will be of your ears before you take yours out . 
what , are you busy , hello ? 
and so did i. 
and take me , love , in my eyes , so like you . 
out , you bag of draff ! 
give me your hand . 
what 's going on ? 
was as my father that went away so fast ? 
how is my lady work ? 
beams , pikes , and more pikes ! 
o me ! 
what is this ? 
this war shall judge that . 
there lies as like tybalt . 
for i never saw very fair till this night . 
i have forgotten why i called you again . 
the citizens are up , and tybalt is dead . 
no , that there were two such fellows , we should have none anon , as one would kill the other . 
yes , cry ? 
you 'll pass the loss , but not the loss of the friend you weep for . 
are you going ? 
i was sick under your arm . 
madam , your mother craves a word with you . 
don 't saints and holy pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other some didn 't . 
i know not , sir . 
your houses ! 
o , teach me how i should forget to know . 
why are you wringing your hands ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it gives me out . 
she lies the same fashion , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering . 
else , you would have made your tale sound . 
o , go away ! 
haste to your chamber . 
this is the truth , or let benvolio die . 
perchance she can 't meet him . 
i have . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he will have it on you . 
speak me , coward ! 
let me weep for blood such a loss . 
it 's out first ! 
fellow ! 
and why are you butting on , my lady wit ? 
here comes the wild tybalt back again . 
yes , the heads of maids , or their virginity . 
can 't you breathe awhile ? 
we are undone , lady , we are undone ! 
i cry you , youth , don 't put another fall on my head in motion me to speak . 
i will kiss your lips . 
why , like ? 
at nine . 
ye don 't know what you 're work ! 
nurse , commend me to your lady and mistress . 
younger girls than she are made happy dames . 
and comfort is welcomed in such a bare time . 
where do you make of ? 
is my father well ? 
i can take ready , and i 'm motivated . 
o , will you leave me so unsatisfied ? 
a greater power than we can cross has opposed our purposes . 
then , do my lips have the fault that they have taken of yours ? . 
so stand crying . 
it 's mark am . 
o cousin , cousin ! 
what shall i swear by ? 
well , we were born to die . 
and he hears you , you will make him mad . 
be patient , for the time is large and wide . 
don 't you have any word of joy ? 
i cry of justice , which you , prince , must give ; romeo dead tybalt . 
take going , take out in here , patience ! 
peace , ho , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ? 
i will follow you . 
in faith , we may put up our pipes and go home . 
put your sword away , or lay it to help me break up this war . 
what , not a word ? 
then she is fair , and nothing can be out . 
sweet , so do i. 
in our lady , thirty years . 
in mary , that , i think , is young petruchio . 
go ready to great fortune ! 
what noise is here ? 
to answer that sound , i should grant to you . 
death lies in her with an untimely frost of the sweetest blow of all the fields . 
scurvy patch ! 
this cannot blood him . 
i cannot draw . 
that dreamers often lodge . 
but why , villain , did you kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then , i 'll give it to you to pay . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo killed him ; he killed mercutio . 
leave me , and do as i desire you . 
give me your torch , boy . 
fear makes over me . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous discover , a jealous discover ! 
to what , like tell me ? 
away with the good stools , resolve the china closet , like to the trencher . 
makes no quarrel . 
i 'm not shrewd a lie . 
the answer that you make of this day is higher than the tale you answer . 
o mischief , you are ready to take in the thoughts of desperate men ! 
what ! 
did you make the point to us , sir ? 
i will bring you there . 
what does that mean ? 
well , in that take , you lose . 
the time is of such a boring date . 
are you picking a fight with us , sir ? 
i am for you . 
tybalt , the reason that i have to love you does colour too much the spirit that is good for such a greeting . 
my husband is in earth , my credit of heaven . 
i am not long , i warrant , for this time . 
gentle mercutio , put up your sword . 
for shame , for shame ! 
i have more care to go than will to go . 
commend me to thy lady ; and bid her to whip the whole household to bed , which heavy thought makes them more like to do . 
give him , good mercutio . 
she is too fair , too wise ; wisely too fair , to get her own content in making me despair . 
why , what is tybalt ? 
two of the fairest stars of all the heaven , having some cause , do entreat her eyes to twinkle of their sphere till the stars answer . 
yoke of age or not , in all days of the year , make the middle of july , she 'll be fourteen . 
have you dead tybalt ? 
you say well . 
romeo shall thank you , daughter , to us both . 
as i live to see you married , i have my will . 
then say what you know of all in this . 
i wouldn 't have them see you here of the world . 
do you with this speed ? 
what will you make us ? 
but you 're not quickly motivated to take . 
no , i am the very little o of courtesy . 
there 's store of time . 
you are to blame , my lord , a tongue her with this . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who can this bloody war ? 
stir to mantua . 
what is like you use ? 
dry thought creatures our blood . 
o most heavy , ill woman ! 
my sword , i say ! 
what , wake up , sir ! 
come hither , keeper . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . 
why , how are you , juliet ? 
death , that has taken her away to make me wail , knits up my tongue and will not let me speak . 
why do you go ? 
what sudden tongue so sweetly caps me ? 
a day as black as this has never been seen ! 
you say true . 
then , i 'll take you , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say of our marriage ? 
o world ! 
what villain , madam ? 
commend me to your lady . 
i won 't lack a chance to send you my greetings , like . 
i 'm but trying to keep the peace . 
can heaven be so jealous ? 
i will piece it out , and everything will be well , i warrant you , fellow . 
yeah , is the worst well ? 
o , forgive me for bringing you this heavy news , for you did leave it all up to me , sir . 
so ho ! 
what if this mixture doesn 't hand at all ? 
i thought it was all of the best . 
is like a gentle thing ? 
that is as the traitor murderer lies . 
good night . 
some fairer than my love ? 
not me , take me . 
give him in safety until the prince arrives . 
i will not fail ! 
o brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he told me paris was going to marry juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i of you there for the goose ? 
this is no time to play . 
go away , and stand over there . 
love ! 
young romeo , is it ? 
give her to come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i may prove the young romeo ? 
i have had it , and sound too . 
where are the worst beginners of this war ? 
then , i dare you , stars ! 
your medicine are ready . 
i did give the point , sir . 
peter ! 
here comes my man . 
well , what was yours ? 
your lady mother is coming to your chamber . 
take ! 
let 's go , and , with a fair eye , set her face of some others that i shall give you , and i will give you know your swan is a crow . 
believe me , i can tell her time to the day . 
you won 't play then ? 
o peer , look how our daughter bloods ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's almost night now . 
give me that chisel-edged pick and the iron pull . 
o lord , they 're rage ! 
i piece of as good a man as you do . 
come , come away !
