i am no villain . 
give it me ! 
you say i should groan , and tell you ? 
curse the day ! 
he was not born to be shame . 
if i can trust my dreams , some joyful news is coming . 
either thou , or i , or both of us have to go with him . 
he slew thy kinsman , brave mercutio , and then young romeo kill him . 
how canst thou be out of breath , when you have enough breath to tell me that you 're out of breath ? 
o painful , o , o day ! 
why , here 's the vial . 
and what of that ? 
i 'm glad he was 't for this quarrel . 
i would the fool were dead and married to her grave ! 
but he 's not better than mine . 
bring me in my house , benvolio , or i 'll have slept . 
his love is blind , that it by in the dark . 
i 'm done . 
i can read mine own fortune in my woes . 
i upbraid you for obsessing of her , not to love her , my student . 
o love ! 
most welcome home in mantua . 
i 'll sting thee on the ear for that jest . 
welcome , gentlemen . 
hold the friar too . 
he is the son and heir of old tiberio . 
did he make away clean ? 
can 't i speak ? 
well , sir , for silver hath a sweet sound . 
i 'll frown upon them as they pass by , and they can react what they will . 
romeo will answer the challenge . 
in my desperate estate , i must be alone . 
madam , i 'm here . 
now , by my troth , i 'm so angry that i 'm shaking all o 'er . 
as i slept under this yew-tree here , i had a dream , that my master , and one else were blows and that my master . 
is it that betimes in the day ? 
romeo is hateful , however god is 't . 
what kind of devil art thou to torture me thus ? 
so i die with a kiss . 
but here come some , in the nick of time . 
i 'll make you sing . 
i would i was your bird . 
no man that knows how to write may answer a letter . 
a dragon , did ever hide me in such a fair cave ? 
do 't you have a letter for me from the friar ? 
peter , stay for me at the gate . 
go tell him of this . 
what say you , james well , i do 't know what to say . 
i 'll go call the watch . 
what shall we say is our pardon for being here ? 
give me my sin . 
who is her mother ? 
i 'll confess to you that i love him . 
young man , that 's wrong , if you 're grow out of this bed betimes . 
there were twenty montagues blows in this heinous rise , and all those twenty could but kill one man . 
truly , cousin , i love a woman . 
investigate how this foul murder came of . 
what a man , young lady . 
if love is blind , it may 't strike the target . 
haply you 've out of life , and not from books . 
tybalt was my cousin ! 
where the devil can romeo be ? 
as i remember , this should be the house . 
you 're grow too angry . 
fie upon romeo ! 
tell me , my good friend , what is that light there ? 
who 's that cry so loud ? 
all prepare to take this fair corse to her grave . 
o plague ! 
now he 's ready for

that 's very shortly . 
but to be free and give it you once more . 
where is my mother ?

look , sir , here comes the lady walk towards my cell . 
ay , madam , he lies beyond my gain . 
what is the matter ? 
a fair target is the one is hit the fastest . 
no , not till thursday . 
i 'll give him by his thanks , that we 're even . 
peace , you mumbling fool ! 
tell me , how came you hither ? 
tell me , my daughter juliet , what is your disposition of married ? 
you were never with me for nothing , if you were 't there for the goose . 
or shall we go without apologizing ? 
romeo , get thee gone . 
this is a for mercy sight ! 
do you mean to wash him out of his grave with tears ? 
well , well , i know 't . 
can 't you find a reason without my give you one ? 
that 's him , that villain romeo .

come , come ! 
what , ho ! 
but what say you to my request ?

dinner is done , and we 're going to win too late . 
you 're not take one come to an enemy . 
what , wilt thou do ? 
look , she 's come home from confession with a merry look on her face . 
then that took my letter to romeo ? 
virginity makes her look pale and green . 
it 's late . 
do you see 't , i 'm out of breath ? 
do as i tell you . 
if we look like musicians , you may think to hear nothing but . 
is 't she proud of such a match ? 
o , what a heavy day ! 
do 't deny to him that you love me . 
how canst thou play them ? 
the boy is such me that one approaches . 
why , i pray thee ? 
but what mishaps occur , they can 't corrupt the joy i feel with one look on her . 
god choose you to receive his grace . 
do so , and tell my sweet , to be ready to chide at me . 
no , cousin , i 'm tears . 
she will a bawd ! 
commend me to your daughter . 
do you bring me a letter from the friar ? 
good morrow to you both .

from henceforth take care of your messages yourself . 
wilt thou provoke me ? 
where are they my to come ? 
ay , boy , i 'm ready . 
o heavens ! 
will 't he ? 
for a full half hour . 
she 's ready to go , but she 'll ne 'er return . 
do 't fear me . 
how should madmen hear , if wise men may do 't , see ? 
she disgusts me , the little wanton ! 
they 're call for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen . 
o heavy day ! 
i pray you again for nothing can be wrong , if she is well . 
the hence ! 
my soul lies upon it- a thousand times good night . 
i know this .

by my count , i was under your mother at but of your age , whilst you of a maid . 
what 's this noise ? 
o flesh , flesh , you 've turned pale and weak like a fish . 
i pray you , sir , have patience .

if i were in the trick of all the way you are , my life insurance rates would be of high . 
i hear some . 
a quarrel ? 
you must to juliet and show her up . 
well , begin the thought of marriage . 
ay , pilgrim-they have lips that they 're my to pray with . 
o , rude and unthankful boy ! 
that 's the way to show me love . 
he slipped away and went to bed . 
why dost thou knocks so hard ? 
ay , that 's true . 
but look on me , and i 'm invincible against their malice . 
i hear a noise in . 
hang out ? " who do you think we are , musicians in a band ? 
come hither , man . 
am i like one of these lads ? 
ay , ay , this is the rope ladder . 
i 'll go , sir , and i will 't trouble you . 
what further harm must i endure in my age ? 
whose house ? 
no , noble romeo , you 've must round . 
god bless thee ! 
answer me like men . 
god in heaven bless her ! 
i know where he is .

how long hath he been there ? 
no matter . 
do you love me ? 
o , deadly sin ! 
the sun itself is never seen a man as fair as the world began . 
but , i 'm hasty-footed time for that i have . 
i do 't know his name . 
farewell ! 
answer that . 
send thy man away . 
give me some comfort , nurse . 
this is good . 
was ever such an evil book with such a fair cover ? 
why dost thou grating so angry ? 
god in heaven bless thee . 
that might be the case , sir , 
madam ! 
it was . 
go with me to the monument . 
your mother .

who is it ? 
pray you , sir , do you know how to read ? 
amen ! 
my noble uncle , do you know why he ages here ? 
farewell , my cousin .

or , if he have set it down his thoughts , give me his letter . 
why the devil have you come between us ? 
you 're not attend me to me . 
so the cooks who can 't lick their fingers are in 't . 
who should now pay the price of mercutio 's life ? 
where is my romeo ? 
pray you , hear me , sir . 
you have spoke to him ? 
that 's no news ! 
it 's a sweet lozenge that you choke on . 
where is she ? 
give me my fan , peter . 
i 'll go with you . 
no , sir . 
come , awake , awake , awake ! 
she 's tongue , but she 's not say nothing . 
o my ! 
for when you cut your shin . 
are you bound to tell me that ? 
what think you on thursday ? 
that resounds as the voice of friar john . 
do as i pray you , for i 'm done fearing you . 
stay , tybalt , soft ! 
but i will kill thee by petting you . 
let me stand till you remember your reason . 
i will be brief , because i 'm not live to tell a tedious tale . 
let me speak with you of your fortunes . 
is 't that what he said ? 
take my remark in whose sense you please . 
ay , well , things could have better . 
leave of him , jack sauce ! 
nurse ? 
good man , why dost thou weep ? 
can thy man keep counsel ? 
what ? 
the prince will give you the death forfeiture , if you have caught . 
he knows what ? 
i 'll answer for you . 
now , you know the cause of the haste . 
it 's the lark , that sings so out of tune , so hard . 
you 're a saucy little boy . 
i remember well , where i should be , and here i am . 
madam , an eagle should not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of paris . 
unhappy fortune ! 
but i am thankful that you have found it . 
what else is love ? 
lie down , and there . 
no . 
why , then . 
how fares my juliet ? 
why , then , i 'll say this quickly : the valiant paris desires you as his bride . 
then you were well on target . 
monday , my lord . 
were you talk of juliet ? 
do 't say nothing else . 
you know too much of distress . 
what ? 
where else would she be ? 
good morrow , gentlemen . 
you 'll find me so much to do so , sir , if you give me a cause . 
stand up . 
hold on , then . 
good night , good night . 
how is she ? 
that 's foolish . 
why , this is 't not jest better than groaning of love ? 
hark , your romeo will be here . 
hath romeo slew himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
you could not prevent her from dying but ever , but heaven will give her eternal life . 
hie thee , or i 'll cuff you on the ears with my sword before you have thine drawn . 
what , wilt thou do ? 
so did i. 
and trust me , love , you look pale to me too . 
most shallow girl ! 
give me your hand . 
what art thou , girl ? 
was that my father that left here in such haste ? 
how does my wife ? 
use your cudgels and spears ! 
o my ! 
what is this ? 
this quarrel will first be that dies . 
tybalt is lying there . 
mine eyes were liars and swearers , then , for i never saw true beauty ere night . 
i have forgot why i called you again . 
the citizens are about , and tybalt is dead . 
if there were two men like you , pretty : there 'd be none for the two of you would kill each other . 
o , noise ? 
you will be the loss , but the man you weep for will be nothing . 
will you go ? 
he struck me under your arm . 
madam , your mother would speak with you . 
do 't saints and pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other girl did not love me . 
i do 't , sir . 
beshrew your red ! 
teach me to forget to think ! 
why dost thou look so ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it makes me mad . 
she 's lie on the earth , but like him , blubbering and weep , weeping and blubbering . 
o , you 're deceived . 
o , away ! 
go to your chamber . 
benvolio is part of the montague house . 
perchance she can 't find him . 
i do . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news . 
let 's go at it , coward ! 
let me be weep for such a great loss . 
i have my naked sword out . 
wife ! 
and why , good lady ? 
here comes the furious tybalt again . 
you mean their cut off their heads , take their maidenheads-whatever . 
can 't you stay for a word or two ? 
we 're undone , lady , you 're undone ! 
i pray you , young man , do 't be angry . 
i will kiss thy lips . 
why should you do it , my love ? 
by nine o 'clock . 
gregory , remember how to slash . 
nurse , commend me to your lady . 
fie younger than she oft marry , and be happy mothers . 
and that 's good to have joy in such a joyless . 
where do you ? 
is my father well ? 
i strike hard when i 'm angry . 
o , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ? 
a greater power than we cannot fight , hath puddled our business . 
then do my lips now have the sin , they took from thine ? 
hold tears . 
it 's but even now nine o 'clock . 
o cousin , cousin ! 
what should i swear by ? 
well , we were all born to die . 
if he hears you , you 'll offend him . 
you should be able to endure this for the world is broad and wide . 
do 't you have one word of joy ? 
you , prince , the man that may give me justice . 
therefore hence ! 
be quiet , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ? 
i 'll follow . 
well , we may put up our pipes and go home . 
either put up your sword or use it to help me no more of this quarrel . 
what , you do 't speak a word ? 
then she is well , and nothing is wrong . 
my sweet , so do i. 
i swear , it must be thirty years . 
well , that one , i think , is young , petruchio . 
would me fortune . 
what 's the noise in here ? 
if i have that , i 'd be drives confession to you . 
she 's dead , like a fair flower , by an unseasonable frost . 
that ungentle rat ! 
what i 'm say can 't anger him . 
you 're a lover . 
my dream told me that dreamers oft lie . 
but why , thou villain , did you kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then i 'll do give it to you . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo killed tybalt . 
leave me , and do what i told you to do . 
give me your torch , boy . 
i 'm suddenly fear . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous woman , a jealous woman ! 
what ? 
take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates . 
it 's all one . 
i 've said nothing wrong . 
the excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself . 
destructive thoughts come apace to the minds of desperate men ! 
stay . 
are you biting your thumb at us ? 
i 'll bring you there . 
what of that ? 
well , you 're not on target there . 
it 's out of the fashion to give lengthy explanations so . 
are you a quarrel ? 
i 'll fight with thee . 
tybalt , i have a cause to love you that lets me put away the rage , i should have and that abuse . 
my husband lives upon the earth , my vows of marriage is in heaven . 
i 'm lost in this world , i think . 
noble mercutio , put up your sword . 
fie ! 
i will stay , more than i will go . 
commend me to your lady , and bid her come all in the house to bed . 
call him , mercutio . 
she 's too fair and too good to serve heaven 's blessing by me herself . 
why , what 's tybalt 's tale ? 
two of the best endued with some stars in all the heaven had to go away on business , and they 're bid her eyes to twinkle in their places till they return . 
whether it 's , or odd , of all the days in the year , in the night of lammas eve , she 'll be fourteen . 
you have killed tybalt ? 
you speak well . 
romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us . 
if i live to see you marry but ever , all my will shall come so . 
tell us what you know this affair . 
i 'd give nothing to keep them from seeing you here . 
do you think it 's a good plot to haste ? 
what will you give us ? 
angry enough to run away . 
the right . 
there 's foison follow of time . 
my lord , you 're wrong to berate her so . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who began this quarrel ? 
take a little the vacation in of mantua . 
what would you ? 
alas , takes away our color . 
o , that most wicked fiend ! 
i would my sword . 
arise , man ! 
come hither , nurse . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and then it 's good night earnest . 
what 's the matter , juliet ? 
death , which hath ta 'en her to make me weep , now ties up my tongue and will 't , let me speak . 
why dost thou stay ? 
who doth salute me so early in the morning ? 
there was never been so black a day as this . 
i see . 
why , let 's fight , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say of our marriage ? 
o life ! 
what villain , madam ? 
give my praises to your lady . 
i will 't miss any to send my love to you . 
i 'm but to keep the peace . 
may be god so jealous and detested ? 
and all things shall be why , i warrant you , wife . 
is the worst well ? 
o , pardon me , to bring this bad news , but you told me , it was my office , sir . 
i 've found it out . 
if this mingle is 't work at all ? 
i thought it was the right . 
is love indeed tender ? 
that 's for the murderer lives . 
good night . 
a woman more beautiful than the one i love ? 
not i , believe me . 
hold him in guard , till the prince is here . 
i will 't shame . 
o , brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he bade me paris was about to marry juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i , press to you in the chase for the goose ? 
it 's not the true time to play . 
away , and stay asunder from me . 
mistress ! 
is it young romeo ? 
bid her come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i can find young romeo ? 
i 'm lost . 
where is the evil men that this quarrel ? 
then i rebel against you , stars ! 
his drugs work . 
i 'm biting my thumb . 
peter ! 
here comes my man , the man i 'm to seek . 
well , what was thy dream ? 
your mother comes to your chamber . 
strike them ! 
hence and compare her objectively to some other girls i 'll show you . 
ay , i know her age to the hour . 
you will 't , then ? 
o mistress , look how our daughter bleeds ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's already almost night . 
give me that pickax and the crowbar . 
o lord , they 're fight ! 
my employer is as good as yours . 
come , come away .
