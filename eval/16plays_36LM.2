o love ! 
welcome mantua . 
i will sting thee on the ear for that jest !

romeo shall answer it . 
i must be my deadly scene alone .

so , i die with a kiss . 
take some new infection to your eye , and the quality poison of the old love shall die .

give me my sin again . 
who is her mother ? 
i will confess to you that i love him . 
young son , it is arguably a distempered head that bids good morrow so soon to your bed . 
some twenty of them in this black , and all those twenty could but take one life . 
in grief , cousin , i do love a woman . 
search , seek , and know how this foul murder done . 
a man , young lady ! 
if love is blind , love can 't find the mint . 
haply you have learned it without book . 
tybalt , my cousin !

as i remember , this should be the house . 
you are too hot , under the collar . 
shame come to romeo ! 
tell me , good friend , what torch is there , that wastes with his beams to grubs and eyeless skull ? 
who is it so high ? 
every one should prepare to follow this fair corse to her grave . 
o woe ! 
now he is for the sense that petrarch flowed in ! 
is it so ? 
that 's very shortly . 
but to be honest and give it you again . 
where is my mother ? 
monday ! 
to supper ; to our house . 
what hast thou found ? 
good e 'en to my ghostly confessor . 
will you go to them ? 
you may 't speak of what you do 't . 
shall i go home , when my heart is here ? 
look , sir , the lady is coming toward my cell . 
ay , madam , from the gain of my hands . 
what 's the matter ? 
a right fair mark , fair coz , is the first . 
no , not till thursday . 
as much to him , if his thanks is too much . 
peace , you mumbling fool ! 
by a name that i do 't know how to tell you what i am . 
tell me , daughter juliet , what think you of married ? 
you were never with me for nothing , when you were not there for the goose . 
or shall we but go without any apology ? 
romeo , leave , be gone ! 
for mercy sight ! 
what , will you wash him from his grave with tears ? 
by my heel , i care not .

his son was but a ward two years ago . 
nurse !

what , lamb ! 
what , how now ! 
but now , my lord , what say you to my request ? 
we 're talking here in a common place . 
in love ? 
without his fish eggs , like a dried herring . 
o romeo , romeo ! 
you 're a liar ! 
have a gentle day ! 
i do 't , and he shall know 't , tell me . 
no , my good lord . 
the inherited estate ! 
what says romeo ? 
saint francis be my carries ! 
good romeo , withdraw thyself . 
what false take did i give thee ? 
i am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse . 
father , what news ? 
it 's no morning yet . 
so shall you confess , i am sure , that you love me . 
why , bride ! 
have you told her what we have concluded for her ? 
a challenge , on my life . 
well , peace be with you , sir . 
supper is done , and we shall come too late . 
you will not budge a foot to fight ! 
what , wilt thou do ? 
see , how she comes from confession with a happy face . 
the , that took my letter to romeo ? 
her cold , white gown is but sick and green , and fools wear it . 
it 's late . 
do you see 't , i 'm out of breath ? 
go , do what i have told you . 
if you make us musicians , look to hear nothing but . 
is 't she proud ? 
o heavy day ! 
do 't deny to him that you love me . 
how can see them ? 
the boy gives the such something is expiate . 
why , one ask ? 
but what sorrow can come , it cannot by the exchange of joy that one low , in her sight gives me . 
god mark you for his grace ! 
do so , and bid my sweet to prepare to chide at me . 
no , cousin , i 'd rather weep . 
she will give him a writ eye she has to some supper . 
commend me to your daughter . 
do 't thou bring me letters from the friar ? 
good morrow to you both . 
dispatch , make rashness , for it grows very late . 
from this time forth , do your messages yourself . 
will you provoke me ? 
where should they come ? 
ay , boy , ready . 
o heaven ! 
what , you 're furnished ! 
a full half hour . 
ready to go , but never . 
do 't fear me . 
how should they , when wise men have no eyes ? 
throw her out , the good for nothing ! 
they 're bid for dates and quinces in the pastry . 
o lamentable day ! 
i 'll ask it again ; for nothing can be wrong , if she is well . 
fie ! 
i 'll tarry , a thousand times good night ! 
what should he say of this ? 
they wash his wounds with tears . 
up . 
by my count i was thy mother pretty near the age that thou art . 
what 's the matter ? 
o flesh , flesh , how do you fishified ! 
i pray you , sir , have patience . 
are you a man ? 
if i were so easy to quarrel as thou art , no man should buy the inherited estate of my life for an hour , and a quarter . 
i hear some . 
fight , sir ! 
go you to juliet , defend her ready . 
well , think of marriage . 
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . 
o rude unthankfulness ! 
this way thou show me love . 
he is wise ; and , on my life , he hath they home to bed . 
who knocks so hard ? 
ay , it did . 
if you will see sweet , then i am protected against their hate . 
i hear some noise within . 
what , do you make us musicians ? 
come hither , man . 
am i in such a fellow ? 
ay , ay , the ropes . 
i 'll go , sir , and not trouble you . 
what additional sorrow conspires against my age ? 
whose house ? 
no , gentle romeo , we must have you round . 
blessings on you ! 
answer me like men . 
god in heaven bless her ! 
i know well where he is . 
down with the montagues ! 
how long hath he been within there ? 
no matter . 
do you love me ? 
o deadly sin ! 
the all-seeing sun never saw nothing to match her for the world first began . 
and yet i would but for the thing that i have . 
i know 't . 
farewell ! 
answer that . 
send thy man away . 
give me some comfort , nurse . 
this is great . 
was ever a book containing such vile matter so how but well bound ? 
why do you storm ? 
now god in heaven bless thee ! 
you may call me so , sir , when i may be a wife . 
madam ! 
it was . 
go with me to the monument . 
your mother . 
what say you ? 
down with the capulets ! 
who is it ? 
good day.-please tell me , sir , can you read ? 
amen ! 
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ? 
farewell , my coz . 
why , she 's in . 
or , if he wrote his mind , give me his letter . 
to romeo &ket; why the devil have you come between us ? 
you do 't understand me . 
therefore , he that cannot lick his fingers will 't back with me . 
who now owes the price of his dear blood ? 
where is my romeo ? 
hark , sir . 
have you met with him ? 
this is the news indeed ! 
a madness most discreet , a choking acid , and a preserving sweet . 
where is she ? 
my fan , peter . 
i 'll go along . 
no , sir . 
come , let 's fetch me ! 
she speaks , but she says nothing . 
ay me ! 
your plantain-leaf is excellent for that . 
will you tell me that ? 
but what say you to thursday ? 
this is the voice of friar john . 
do what you mean to do , i 'm done with you . 
stay , tybalt , soft ! 
but i should kill thee with much cherishing . 
let me stand till you remember . 
i will be brief , for i do 't enough breath to this tedious tale . 
let me wrangle with you of your fortunes . 
hath he said it ? 
take it any way thou wilt . 
ay , by my truth , the case may be amended . 
fie on him , jack sauce ! 
nurse ? 
good heart , at what ? 
can thy man keep counsel ? 
what ? 
the prince will of you to death , if you are taken prisoner . 
the what ? 
i will say it for you . 
now , you know what we 're in haste . 
it is the lark , that sings so out of tune , straining to sing monstrous songs and unpleasing notes . 
you are a ground boy . 
i remember well , where i should be , and here i am . 
an eagle , madam , is not as green , as quick , and is 't so fair an eye as paris hath . 
very ill luck ! 
i 'm not proud that you have , but i 'm thankful that you have . 
what is it ? 
you lie there . 
no . 
well , sir . 
how fares my juliet ? 
so , then , here it is ; the valiant paris seeks you for his love . 
a right good marksman ! 
monday , my lord . 
did you speak of juliet ? 
speak no more . 
my dear son is too acquainted with such sour company . 
what , is your sword out of these foolish ? 
where shall she be ? 
good morrow , gentlemen . 
you shall find me easy enough for that , sir , if you will give me the advantage . 
stand up . 
stay , then . 
good night , good night ! 
how is it with her ? 
o , how honest ! 
why , is 't this better now than groaning for love ? 
you hear : your romeo will be here at night . 
hath romeo slew himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
your part in her you could not keep from death , but heaven keep his part in eternal life . 
hie thee , for fear my sword shall be of your ears , ere you be thine . 
what , are you busy , how now ? 
and so did i. 
and trust me , love , in mine eyes , do you . 
out , you poke of garbage . 
give me your hand . 
what 's the matter ? 
was that my father that went away so fast ? 
how fares my lady ? 
cudgels , pikes , and more pikes ! 
o me ! 
what is this ? 
this fight shall determine . 
there lies the same tybalt . 
for i never saw true beauty till this night . 
i have forgot why i called you again . 
the citizens are up , and tybalt is dead . 
nay , if there were two such fellows , we should have none anon , for one would kill the other . 
ay , noise ? 
you 'll have the loss , but not the loss of the friend you weep for . 
will you go ? 
i was hurt under your arm . 
madam , your mother craves a word with you . 
do 't saints and holy pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other did 't . 
i know not , sir . 
your houses ! 
o , teach me how i should forget to think . 
why dost thou wringing your hands ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it makes me angry . 
she lies that way , blubbering and weep , weeping and blubbering . 
if not , you would have made thy tale great . 
o , away ! 
hie you to your chamber . 
this is the truth , or let benvolio die . 
perchance she can 't meet him . 
i have . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he will take from you . 
fight , coward ! 
let me weep for my such a loss . 
it 's forth already ! 
wife ! 
and why are you butting in , my lady wisdom ? 
here comes the furious tybalt again . 
ay , the heads of maids , or their virginity . 
can 't you rest awhile ? 
we are undone , lady , we are undone ! 
i pray you , youth , do 't put another sin upon my head with urging me to fight . 
i will kiss thy lips . 
why , love ? 
at nine . 
you do 't know what you 're do ! 
nurse , commend me to your lady and mistress . 
younger girls than she is made happy mothers . 
and joy is welcomed in such a needy time . 
where do you ? 
is my father well ? 
i may strike quickly , if i 'm motivated . 
o , will you leave me so unsatisfied ? 
a greater power than we may contradict hath stood out against our purposes . 
then , do my lips have the sin that they have ta 'en from yours ? . 
so call tears . 
it 's 9 . 
o cousin , cousin ! 
what shall i swear by ? 
well , we were born to die . 
if he hears you , you shall offend him . 
be patient , for the world is broad and wide . 
do 't you have no word of joy ? 
i pray for justice , which you , prince , must give ; romeo killed tybalt . 
come , away , away ! 
peace , ho , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ? 
i will follow you . 
in ruled , we may put up our pipes and go home . 
put up your sword , or use it to help me break up this quarrel . 
what , not a word ? 
then she is well , and nothing can be wrong . 
sweet , so do i. 
by our lady , thirty years . 
by mary , that , i think , is young , petruchio . 
go quickly to high fortune ! 
what noise is here ? 
to answer that , i must confess to you . 
death lies upon her , like an untimely frost on the sweetest flower in all the fields . 
scurvy knave ! 
this cannot anger him . 
i cannot move . 
that dreamers oft lie . 
but why , villain , did you kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then , i 'll give it to you as payment . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo killed him ; he killed mercutio . 
leave me , and do as i bid you . 
give me your torch , boy . 
fear comes o 'er me . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous play , a jealous play ! 
what , i pray you , tell me ? 
away with the good stools , remove the china wardrobe lies , look to the plate . 
makes no to thee . 
i 'm not a lie . 
the excuse that you make in this delay is longer than the tale you excuse . 
o mischief , thou art quick to enter into the thoughts of desperate men ! 
what ! 
did you give the finger to us , sir ? 
i will bring you there . 
what should this mean ? 
well , in that strike , mistress . 
the time is of such a tedious duration . 
are you powers above put on their instruments a fight with us , sir ? 
i am for you . 
tybalt , the reason that i love you do excuse very much in that is fitting for such a greeting . 
my lord is on the earth , the faith of heaven . 
i am not long , i , for this world . 
gentle mercutio , put up your sword . 
fie , fie ! 
i have more care to keep than will to go . 
commend me to thy lady ; and bid her to make all the house to bed , which heavy sorrow makes them more like to do . 
call him , good mercutio . 
she is too fair , too wise ; wisely too fair , return of her own happiness by me herself . 
why , what is tybalt ? 
two of the fairest stars in heaven , being the business , do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till the stars return . 
two of days , or no , of all days in the year , come in the midst of july , she 'll be fourteen . 
you have killed tybalt ? 
you say well . 
romeo shall thank you , daughter , for us both . 
if i live to see you married , i have my wish . 
then tell what you know of all this . 
i would 't have them see you here for the world . 
dost thou like this carries ? 
what will you give us ? 
but , you 're not quickly motivated to strike . 
no , i am the very little mint of courtesy . 
there 's foison follow of time . 
you are to blame , my lord , to berate her thus . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who began this bloody fight ? 
traffic to of mantua . 
what is need you ? 
thirsty sorrow carouses our blood . 
o most wicked , pernicious woman ! 
my sword , i say ! 
what , awake , man ! 
come hither , nurse . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . 
why , how now , juliet ? 
death , that hath ta 'en her to make me wail , ties up my tongue , and will not let me speak . 
why dost thou stay ? 
what betimes tongue so sweetly salutes me ? 
a day as black as this hath not been seen ! 
you speak troth . 
then , i 'll fetch thee , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say of our marriage ? 
o life ! 
what villain , madam ? 
commend me to your lady . 
i shall miss 't to send you my greeting , love . 
i 'm but to keep the peace . 
can heaven be so jealous ? 
i will piece it out , and all things shall be well , i thee , lady . 
ay , is the worst well ? 
o , pardon me , to bring you this heavy news , since you did leave it all to me , sir . 
so , ho ! 
if this mingle is 't work at all ? 
i thought it was for the best . 
is love a tender thing ? 
that is the traitor murderer lives . 
good night . 
one fairer than my love ? 
not i , believe me . 
hold him in safety , till the prince found . 
i will not shame ! 
o brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he bade me paris to juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i with you there for the goose ? 
this is no time to play . 
away , and stand there . 
mistress ! 
young romeo , is it ? 
call her to come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo ? 
i have had it , and soundly . 
where is the wicked beginners of this quarrel ? 
then , i defy thee , stars ! 
your drugs are quick . 
i did give the finger , sir . 
peter ! 
here comes the man . 
well , what was yours ? 
your lady mother comes to your chamber . 
strike ! 
let 's go , and , with a clear eye , compare her face with some other that i shall show you , and i will make you think your swan is a crow . 
believe me , i can tell her age to the hour . 
you will 't play then ? 
o mistress , look , how our daughter bleeds ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's almost night . 
give me that chisel-edged take and the iron wrench . 
o lord , they 're fight ! 
i serve as good a man as you do . 
come , come away !
