I am no villain. 
Give it to me! 
You mean I should groan and tell you? 
Curse the day! 
He was not born to be shameful. 
If I can trust my dreams, then some joyful news is coming soon. 
Either you, or I, or both of us have to go with him. 
He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed him. 
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath? 
Oh painful, painful, painful day! 
Alright, here's the vial. 
And what of that? 
I'm glad he wasn't here for this fight. 
I would the fool were dead and married to her grave! 
But he's not better than mine. 
Take me in some house, Benvolio, or I'll pass out. 
His love is blind, so it by in the dark. 
I'm finished. 
I can read my own fortune in my misery. 
I upbraid you for obsessing of her, not for loving her, my student. 
Oh love! 
Welcome back from Mantua. 
I'll bite you on the ear for that joke. 
Welcome, gentlemen. 
Hold the friar too. 
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio. 
Did he get away clean? 
Can't I say something? 
Well, sir, for silver hath a sweet sound. 
I'll frown at them as they pass by, and they can react disparagement they want. 
Romeo will answer the challenge. 
In my desperate situation, I have to act alone. 
Madam, I'm here. 
Now, I swear, I'm so angry that I'm shaking all over. 
As I slept under this yew-tree here, I had a dream that my master and one else were fighting and that my master killed him. 
Is it that early in the day? 
Romeo is hateful, though God isn't. 
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this? 
So I die with a kiss. 
But here come some people, in the nick of time. 
I'll make you sing. 
I would I was your bird. 
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter. 
Did a dragon ever hide in such a fair cave? 
Don't you have a letter for me from the friar? 
Peter, stay for me at the gate. 
Go tell him of this. 
What do you say, James Well, I don't know what to say. 
I'll go call the watch. 
What will we say is our excuse for being here? 
Give me my sin back. 
Who is her mother? 
I'll confess to you that I love him. 
Young man, something's wrong if you're sue out of bed this early. 
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this abominable riot, and together those twenty could but kill one man. 
Seriously, cousin, I love a woman. 
Investigate how this foul murder came about. 
What a man, young lady. 
If love is blind, it can't strike the target. 
Perhaps you've learned from life and not from books. 
Tybalt was my nephew! 
Where the devil can Romeo be? 
As I remember, this should be the house. 
You're sue too angry. 
Shame on Romeo! 
Tell me, my good friend, what is that light over there? 
Who's that call so loud? 
Everyone prepare to take this fair corse to her grave. 
Oh pain! 
Now he's ready for 
Is it indeed true? 
That's very soon. 
Only to be bounteous and give it to you once more. 
Where is my mother? 
Monday! 
To our house. 
What have you found out? 
That's how flimsy and unreal pleasure then is. 
Are you going to eke them? 
You can't talk of something that you don't feel. 
Can I go away while my heart stays here? 
Look, sir, here comes the lady walk towards my cell. 
Yes, madam, lies he beyond my reach. 
What is the matter? 
A fair target is the one that shows strike the fastest. 
No, not till Thursday. 
I'll give him fellow thanks, so we're even. 
Be quiet, you mumbling fool! 
Tell me, how did you get in here? 
Tell me, my daughter Juliet, what is your disposition of married? 
You were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose. 
Or should we enter without apologizing? 
Romeo, out of here. 
This is a for mercy sight! 
Are you mean to wash him out of his grave with tears? 
Well, well, I don't care. 
Can't you find a reason without my giving you one? 
That's him, that villain Romeo. 
Do you need my help? 
Oh my, Oh my! 
Come on, what did Romeo say? 
His son was a lesser but two years ago. 
Nurse! 
Take this. 
Come on! 
Hey! 
But what do you say to my request? 
We're talking here in a common place. 
You're in love? 
He looks skinny, like a dried herring without his eggs, and he hasn't had his girl. 
Oh, my! 
You lie. 
Have a good day! 
I don't know, and he won't tell me. 
No, my good lord. 
Your life insurance? 
What does Romeo say? 
Saint Francis, help me! 
Hide yourself, good Romeo. 
What do you mean I life of you out? 
I am the youngest man by that name, for there is no one younger, or worse. 
Father, what's the news? 
It's still a long time till daybreak. 
You will also confess, I'm sure, that you love me. 
Hey, bride! 
Have you told her our decision? 
I wager it's a challenge. 
Well, may peace be with you. 
Dinner is over, and we're going to get there too late. 
You're not taking one come toward an enemy. 
What, are you hurt? 
Look, she's come home from confession with a merry look on her face. 
Then that took my letter to Romeo? 
Virginity makes her look sick and green. 
It's late. 
Don't you see that I'm out of breath? 
Do as I tell you. 
If we look like musicians to you, you can expect to hear nothing but noise. 
Isn't she proud of such a match? 
Oh, what a sad day! 
Don't deny to him that you love me. 
How can you play them like that? 
The boy is such me that one approaches. 
Why, may I ask? 
But what mishaps occur, they can't corrupt the joy I feel with one look at her. 
May God choose you to receive his grace. 
Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me. 
No, cousin, I'm crying. 
She will A pimp! 
Give my noble self to your daughter. 
Do you bring me a letter from the friar? 
Good morrow to you both. 
Hurry up, it's sue late. 
From now on, take care of your messages yourself. 
Are you going to provoke me? 
Where are they my to come? 
Yes, boy, I'm ready. 
Oh heavens! 
Won't he? 
For a full half hour. 
She's ready to go, but she'll never return. 
Don't fear me. 
How should madmen hear, if wise men can't though see? 
She disgusts me, the little hussy! 
They're call for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen. 
Oh, sad day! 
I ask that again for nothing can be wrong if she is well. 
The Get out of here! 
My soul lies upon it- A thousand times good night. 
I know all of this. 
Are they batler out his wounds with their tears? 
Up. 
By my count, I was already your mother at but of your age, while you doom a virgin. 
What's this noise? 
O flesh, flesh, you've turned pale and weak like a fish. 
Please, sir, have patience. 
Are you a man? 
If I were in the trick of fighting the way you are, my life insurance rates would be sky high. 
I hear some noise. 
Start a fight? 
You should go to Juliet and fashion her up. 
Well, begin thought of marriage now. 
Yes, pilgrim-they have lips that they're my to pray with. 
Oh, rude and unthankful boy! 
That's the way to show me friendship. 
I wager he slipped away and went home to bed. 
Why are you knocking so hard? 
Yes, that's true. 
Just look at me kindly, and I'm invincible against their hatred. 
I hear a noise inside. 
Hang out?" Who do you think we are, musicians in a band? 
Come here, man. 
Am I indeed like one of those guys? 
Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder. 
I'll go, sir, and I won't meddle you. 
What further dolor must I endure in my old age? 
Whose house? 
No, noble Romeo, you've had to dance. 
God bless you! 
Answer me like men. 
God in heaven bless her! 
I know where he is. 
Down with the Montagues! 
How long hath he been there? 
No matter. 
Do you love me? 
Oh, fatal sin! 
The sun itself hath never seen any as fair since the world began. 
But I'm hasty-footed time for something I already have. 
I don't know his name. 
Farewell! 
Answer that question. 
Send your man away. 
Give me some comfort, Nurse. 
This is good. 
Was there ever such an evil book with such a fair cover? 
Why are you grating so angry? 
May God in heaven bless you. 
That might be the case sir, 
Madam! 
It was. 
Go with me to the tomb. 
Your mother. 
Lose nothing? 
Down with the Capulets! 
Who is it? 
Excuse me, sir, do you know how to read? 
Amen! 
My noble uncle, do you know why he ages this way? 
Goodbye, cousin. 
Why, she's inside. 
Or, if he wrote down his thoughts, give me his letter. 
Why the hell did you come in between us? 
You're not attend me to me. 
So the cooks who can't lick their fingers aren't hired. 
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life? 
Where is my Romeo? 
Now pray listen, sir. 
Have you spoke to him? 
That's indeed news! 
It's a sweet lozenge that you choke on. 
Where is she? 
Give me my fan, Peter. 
I'll come with you. 
No, sir. 
Come on, wake up, wake up, wake up! 
She's talking, but she's not say anything. 
Oh my! 
For when you cut your shin. 
Are you going to tell me that? 
What do you think of Thursday? 
That resounds like the voice of Friar John. 
Do as you please, for I'm done fearing you. 
Wait, Tybalt, wait! 
But I would kill you by petting you too much. 
Let me stand here till you remember your reason. 
I will be brief for I'm not going to live long enough to tell a tedious story. 
Let me talk to you of your situation. 
Isn't that what he said? 
Take my remark in whose sense you like. 
Yes, well, things could get better. 
Forget of him, Jack! 
Nurse? 
Good man, why are you crying? 
Can your man keep a secret? 
What? 
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught. 
He knows what? 
I'll answer for you. 
Now you know the reason for the rush. 
It's the lark that sings so out of tune, delivers such rough noise. 
You're an saucy little boy. 
I remember very well where I should be, and here I am. 
Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris. 
Unhappy fortune! 
But I am thankful that you have found it. 
What else is love? 
Lie down right there. 
No. 
Well then. 
How is my Juliet? 
Well then, I'll say this quickly: the valiant Paris desires you as his bride. 
Then you were right on target. 
Monday, my lord. 
Were you talk of Juliet? 
Don't say anything else. 
You know too much of suffering. 
What? 
Where else would she be? 
Good morning, gentlemen. 
You'll find me ready enough to do that, sir, if you give me a reason. 
Stand up. 
Hold on, then. 
Good night, good night. 
How is she? 
That's foolish. 
Why, isn't all this not jest better than groaning of love? 
Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight. 
Has Romeo killed himself? 
On Thursday, sir? 
You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life. 
Hurry up, or I'll cuff you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn. 
What, are you busy? 
So did I. 
And trust me, love, you look pale to me too. 
You shallow girl! 
Give me your hand. 
What are you, girl? 
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry? 
How is my wife? 
Use your cudgels and spears! 
Oh my! 
What is this? 
This fight will first who dies. 
Tybalt is lying over there. 
My eyes were liars, then, for I never saw true beauty before tonight. 
I have forgot why I called you back. 
The citizens are around, and Tybalt is dead. 
If there were two men like you, pretty soon there'd be none for the two of you would kill each other. 
Oh, noise? 
You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for will feel nothing. 
Are you going? 
He struck me from under your arm. 
Madam, your mother desires to speak to you. 
Don't saints and pilgrims have lips too? 
The other girl did not love me. 
I don't know, sir. 
Curse your families! 
Teach me to forget to think! 
Why do you look so upset? 
Madam, I am not well. 
It makes me mad. 
She's lying on the ground but like him, blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. 
Oh, you're wrong. 
Oh, go away! 
Go to your bedroom. 
Benvolio is part of the Montague family. 
Maybe she can't find him. 
I do. 
Tell him so yourself, and see how he takes the news. 
Let's go at it, coward! 
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss. 
I have my naked sword out. 
Wife! 
And why, wise lady? 
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. 
You mean their Cut off their heads, take their maidenheads-whatever. 
Can't you stay for a moment? 
We're ruined, lady, we're ruined! 
Please, young man, don't make me angry. 
I will kiss your lips. 
Why would you do that, my love? 
By nine o'clock. 
Gregory, remember how to slash. 
Nurse, commend me to to your lady. 
Girls younger than she oft marry and grown happy mothers. 
And it's good to have joy in such a joyless time. 
Where do you come from? 
Is my father well? 
I hit hard when I'm angry. 
Oh, are you going to leave me so unsatisfied? 
A greater power than we can fight hath puddled our plan. 
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours? 
Stop crying. 
It's but even now nine o'clock. 
Oh cousin, cousin! 
What should I swear by? 
Well, we were all born to die. 
If he hears you, you'll make him angry. 
You should be able to endure this for the world is broad and wide. 
Don't you have one word of joy? 
You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice. 
So out of here! 
Be quiet, for shame! 
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run? 
I'll follow after you. 
Well, we can put away our pipes and go home. 
Either put away your sword or use it to help me hold this fight. 
What, you don't say a word? 
Then she is well, and nothing is wrong. 
My sweet, so do I. 
I swear, it must be thirty years. 
Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio. 
Wish me luck. 
What's all the noise in here? 
If I answered that question, I'd be delivers confession to you. 
She's dead, like a fair flower, killed by an unseasonable frost. 
That contaminate rat! 
What I'm say can't anger him. 
You're a lover. 
My dream told me that dreamers oft lie. 
But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin? 
Madam, good night. 
Then I'll indeed give it to you. 
Give me those flowers. 
Romeo killed Tybalt. 
Leave me and do what I told you to do. 
Give me your torch, boy. 
I'm suddenly afraid. 
Here comes your father. 
A jealous woman, a jealous woman! 
What? 
Take away the stools, the sideboards, and the plates. 
It's all the same. 
I've said nothing wrong. 
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself. 
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men! 
Wait. 
Are you biting your thumb at us? 
I'll bring you there. 
So what? 
Well, you're not on target there. 
It's out of the fashion to give lengthy explanations like that. 
Are you unseen begin to a fight? 
I'll fight you. 
Tybalt, I have a reason to love you that lets me put away the rage I should feel and excuse that insult. 
My husband is alive on earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven. 
I'm done for in this world, I believe. 
Noble Mercutio, put your sword away. 
Shame on you! 
I will to stay more than I will to go. 
Give my noble self to your lady, and tell her to dispatch all in the house to bed. 
Call to him, Mercutio. 
She's too fair and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by drives me despair. 
Why, what's Tybalt's story? 
Two of the best endued with some stars in the whole sky had to go away on business, and they're beseech her eyes to twinkle in their places till they return. 
Whether it's though or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she'll be fourteen. 
Have you killed Tybalt? 
You speak well. 
Romeo will thank you, my girl, for both of us. 
If I live to see you get married someday, all my part will come true. 
Tell us what you know of this affair. 
I'd give anything to keep them from denied you here. 
Do you think it's a good to rush? 
What will you give us? 
Angry enough to run away. 
The Right. 
There's foison follow of time. 
My lord, you're wrong to berate her like that. 
Farewell. 
Benvolio, who began this fight? 
Take a little the vacation in Mantua. 
What do you want? 
Sadness takes away our color. 
Oh, that most wicked fiend! 
I would my sword. 
Get up, man! 
Come over here, nurse. 
Come, death, and welcome! 
Three words, dear Romeo, and then it's good night for real. 
What's going on, Juliet? 
Death, which hath taken her away to make me cry, now ties up my tongue and won't let me speak. 
Why are you waiting? 
Who doth salute me so early in the morning? 
There hath never been so black a day as today. 
I see. 
Alright, let's fight, boy! 
Romeo. 
What does he say of our marriage? 
Oh life! 
What villain, madam? 
Give my praises to your lady. 
I won't miss any jump to send my love to you. 
I'm but this to keep the peace. 
Can God be so jealous and hateful? 
And all will be alright, I warrant you, wife. 
Is the worst well? 
Oh, pardon me for bringing this bad news, but you told me it was my job, sir. 
I've found it out. 
What if this mingle doesn't work at all? 
I thought it was the right to do. 
Is love indeed tender? 
That's for the murderer is alive. 
Good night. 
A woman more fair than the one I love? 
Not me, believe me. 
Hold him in guard till the Prince shows here. 
I won't fail. 
Oh, brother Montague, give me your hand. 
We found him in the churchyard. 
I think he told me Paris was of to marry Juliet. 
Romeo! 
Was I though draw to you in the chase for the goose? 
It's not the right time to play. 
Go away and stay asunder from me. 
Mistress! 
Is it young Romeo? 
Tell her to come to me. 
Look, and you'll see. 
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo? 
I'm done for. 
Where are the evil men who began this fight? 
Then I rebel against you, stars! 
His drugs work quickly. 
I'm biting my thumb. 
Peter! 
Here comes my man, the man I'm seek for. 
Well, what was your dream? 
Your mother is coming to your bedroom. 
Hit them! 
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I'll show you. 
Yes, I know her age down to the hour. 
You won't, then? 
Oh wife, look at how our daughter bleeds! 
Romeo is coming. 
It's already almost night. 
Give me that pickax and the crowbar. 
Oh Lord, they're fighting! 
My employer is as good as yours. 
Come, come away.
