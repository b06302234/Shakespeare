You will be the loss, but the man you weep for will feel nothing. 
Are you going? 
He struck me under your arm. 
Madam, your mother desires to speak to you.

So out of here! 
Be quiet, for shame! 
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run? 
I'll follow after you. 
Well, we may put up our pipes and go home.

Wait. 
Are you should tear thy thumb at us? 
I'll bring you there. 
So what? 
Well, you're not on target there. 
It's out of the fashion to give lengthy explanations like that. 
Are you to a fight? 
I'll fight you. 
Tybalt, I have a cause to love you that lets me put away the rage I should be and that insult. 
My husband lives upon earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven.
