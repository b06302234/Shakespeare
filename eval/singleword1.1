i am no villain . 
give it to me ! 
you mean i should groan and tell you ? 
curse the day ! 
he was not born to be shameful . 
if i can trust my dreams , then some joyful news is coming soon . 
either you , or i , or both of us have to go with him . 
he killed your relative , brave mercutio , and then young romeo killed him . 
how can you be out of breath when you have enough to tell me that you 're out of breath ? breath 
oh painful , painful , painful day ! 
alright , here 's the vial . 
and what about that ? 
i 'm glad he wasn 't here for this fight . 
i wish the fool were dead and married to her grave ! 
but he 's not better than mine . 
take me some house , benvolio , or i 'll pass out inside . 
his love is blind , so it belongs in the dark . 
i 'm finished . 
i can read my own worth in my misery . 
i scolded you for about her , not for loving her , my student obsessing . 
oh love ! 
welcome back from mantua . 
i 'll bite you on the ear for that joke . 
welcome , gentlemen . 
hold the friar too . 
he is the son and heir of old tiberio . 
did he get away clean ? 
can 't i say something ? 
well , sir , because silver has a sweet sound . 
i 'll frown at them as they pass by , and they can react however they want . 
romeo will answer the challenge . 
in my desperate situation , i have to act alone . 
madam , i 'm here . 
now , i swear , i 'm angry so that i 'm shaking all over . 
as i slept under this yew-tree here , i had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him . 
is it that early in the day ? 
romeo is hateful , even though god isn 't . 
what kind of devil are you to torture me like this ? 
so i die with a kiss . 
but here come some people , right in the nick of time . 
i 'll make you sing . 
i wish i was your bird . 
any man who knows how to write can answer a letter . 
did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave ? 
don 't you have a letter for me from the friar ? 
peter , wait for me at the gate . 
go tell him about this . 
what do you say , james well , i know what to say don 't . 
i 'll go call the watch . 
what will we say is our excuse for being here ? 
give me my sin back . 
who is her mother ? 
i 'll confess to you that i love him . 
young man , something 's wrong an you 're getting out of this bed early . 
there were twenty montagues fighting in this awful riot , and those twenty could only kill one man together . 
sadly , cousin , i love a woman . 
investigate how this foul murder came about . 
what a man , young lady . 
if love is blind , it can 't hit the target . 
perhaps you 've learned from life and not from books . 
tybalt was my nephew ! 
where the devil can be romeo ? 
as i remember , this should be the house . 
you 're getting too angry . 
shame on romeo ! 
tell me , my good friend , what is that light over there ? 
who 's that calling so loud ? 
everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave . 
oh pain ! 
now he 's ready for 
is it true really ? 
that 's very soon . 
only to be generous and give it to you once more . 
where is my mother ? 
monday ! 
to our house . 
what have you found out ? 
that 's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is . 
you are going to join them ? 
you can 't talk about something that you don feel 't . 
can i go away while my heart stays here ? 
look , sir , here comes the lady walking toward my cell . 
yes , madam , he lies without my danger . 
what is the matter ? 
a beautiful target is the one that hit the fastest gets . 
no , not until thursday . 
i 'll give him even thanks , so we 're even . 
be quiet , you mumbling fool ! 
tell me , how did you get in here ? 
tell me , my daughter juliet , what is your station about getting married ? 
you were never anything with me for an you weren 't there for the goose . 
or should we enter without apologizing ? 
romeo , get out of here . 
this is a pitiful sight ! 
are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears ? 
well , well , i don 't care . 
can 't you find a reason without my giving you one ? 
that 's him , that villain romeo . 
do you need my help ? 
oh , oh my my ! 
come on , what did romeo say ? 
his son was a minor only two years ago . 
nurse ! 
take this . 
come on ! 
hey ! 
but what do you say to my request ? 
we 're talking here in a public place . 
you 're in love ? 
he looks , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he got his girl 't hasn skinny . 
oh , my ! 
you lie . 
have a nice day ! 
don i know 't , and he won 't tell me . 
no , my good lord . 
your life insurance ? 
what does romeo say ? 
saint francis , help me ! 
hide yourself , good romeo . 
what do you mean i faked you out ? 
i am the youngest man by that name , because there is no one younger , or worse . 
father , what 's the news ? 
it 's still a long time until daybreak . 
you will also confess , i 'm sure , that you love me . 
hey , bride ! 
have you told her our decision ? 
i bet it 's a challenge . 
well , may peace be with you . 
dinner is over , and we 're going to get there too late . 
you 're not taking one step toward an enemy . 
what , are you hurt ? 
look , she 's come home from shrift with a happy look on her face . 
who then took my letter to romeo ? 
virginity makes her look sick and green . 
it 's late . 
don 't you see that i 'm out of breath ? 
do as i tell you . 
if we look like musicians to you , you can expect to hear nothing but noise . 
isn 't she proud of such a match ? 
oh , what a sad day ! 
don 't deny to him that you love me . 
how can you assay them like that ? 
the boy is warning me that someone approaches . 
why , may i ask ? 
but whatever misfortunes occur , they can 't ruin the joy i feel with one look at her . 
may god sort you to receive his grace . 
do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to rate me . 
no , cousin , i 'm crying . 
she will a pimp ! 
give my regards to your daughter . 
do you bring me a letter from the friar ? 
good morning to you both . 
hurry up , it 's getting late . 
now , take care of your messages yourself from on . 
you are going to provoke me ? 
where are they supposed to come ? 
yes , boy , i 'm ready . 
oh heavens ! 
he won 't ? 
for a full half hour . 
she 's ready to go , but she 'll never return . 
don 't worry about me . 
how should madmen hear , an wise men can 't even see ? 
she abhors me , the little hussy ! 
they 're calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen . 
oh , sad day ! 
i ask again because nothing can be wrong an she is well that . 
the get out of here ! 
my soul depends on a thousand times good night it- . 
i know all of this . 
are they washing out his wounds with their tears ? 
up . 
by my count , i was your mother at just about your age , while you remain a virgin already . 
what 's this noise ? 
o flesh , flesh , you 've turned pale and weak like a fish . 
like , sir , have patience . 
are you a man ? 
if i were in the habit of fighting the way you are , my life insurance rates would be sky high . 
i hear some noise . 
start a fight ? 
you should go to juliet and dress her up . 
well , start thinking about marriage now . 
yes , pilgrim-they have lips that they 're supposed to pray with . 
oh , rude and unthankful boy ! 
that 's the way to show me friendship . 
i bet he went to bed and slipped away home . 
why are you knocking so hard ? 
yes , that 's true . 
just look at me , and i 'm invincible against their hatred kindly . 
i hear a noise inside . 
hang out who do you think we are in a band ? musicians , " ? 
come here , man . 
am i really like one of those guys ? 
yes , yes , this is the rope ladder . 
i 'll go , sir , and i won 't bother you . 
what further pain must i endure in my old age ? 
whose house ? 
no , gentle romeo , you 've got to dance . 
god bless you ! 
answer me like men . 
god in heaven bless her ! 
i know where he is . 
down with the montagues ! 
how long he has been there ? 
no matter . 
do you love me ? 
oh , deadly sin ! 
the sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began . 
but i 'm wishing for something i have already . 
don i know 't his name . 
farewell ! 
answer that question . 
send your man away . 
give me some comfort , nurse . 
this is good . 
was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover ? 
why are you acting so angry ? 
may god in heaven bless you . 
that might be the case sir , 
madam ! 
it was . 
go with me to the tomb . 
your mother . 
lose nothing ? 
down with the capulets ! 
who is it ? 
excuse me , sir , do you know how to read ? 
amen ! 
my noble uncle , do you know why he acts this way ? 
goodbye , cousin . 
why , she 's inside . 
or , if he wrote down his thoughts , give me his letter . 
why the hell did you come in between us ? 
you 're not paying attention to me . 
so the cooks who can 't lick their fingers aren 't hired . 
who should now pay the price for mercutio 's life ? 
where is my romeo ? 
now like listen , sir . 
you have spoken to him ? 
that 's really news ! 
it 's a sweet lozenge that you choke on . 
where is she ? 
give me my fan , peter . 
i 'll come with you . 
no , sir . 
come on , wake up , wake up , wake up ! 
she 's talking , but she 's not saying anything . 
my oh ! 
for when you cut your shin . 
are you really going to tell me that ? 
what do you think about thursday ? 
that sounds like the voice of friar john . 
do as you please , because i 'm done worrying about you . 
wait , tybalt , wait ! 
but i would kill you by petting you too much . 
let me stand here until you remember your reason . 
i will be brief because i 'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story . 
let me talk to you about your situation . 
isn 't that what he said ? 
take my remark in whichever sense you like . 
yes , well , things could get better . 
forget about him , jack ! 
nurse ? 
good man , why are you crying ? 
can your man keep a secret ? 
what ? 
the prince will give you the death penalty an you get caught . 
he knows what ? 
i 'll answer for you . 
now you know the reason for the rush . 
it 's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise . 
you 're an insolent little boy . 
i remember very well where i should be , and here i am . 
madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as swift as fair as the eyes of , and paris . 
unhappy fortune ! 
but i am thankful that you have found it . 
what else is love ? 
lie down right there . 
no . 
well then . 
how is my juliet ? 
well then , i 'll say this quickly : the valiant paris wants you as his bride . 
then you were right on target . 
monday , my lord . 
were you talking about juliet ? 
don 't say anything else . 
you know too much about sufferance . 
what ? 
where else would she be ? 
good morning , gentlemen . 
you 'll find me swift enough to do , sir , if you give me a reason that . 
stand up . 
hold on , then . 
good night , good night . 
how is she ? 
that 's foolish . 
why , isn 't all this joking better than groaning about love ? 
listen , your romeo will be here tonight . 
has romeo killed himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
you could not her from dying , but heaven will give her eternal life someday prevent . 
hurry up , or i 'll you on the ears with my sword before you have drawn . yours smack 
what , are you busy ? 
so did i. 
and trust me , love , you look pale to me too . 
you worthless girl ! 
give me your hand . 
what are you , girl ? 
that was my father who left here in such a hurry ? 
how is my wife ? 
use your clubs and spears ! 
my oh ! 
what is this ? 
this will fight decide who dies . 
tybalt is lying over there . 
my eyes were liars , then , because i never saw true beauty before tonight . 
i have forgotten why i called you back . 
the citizens are around , and tybalt is dead . 
if there were two men like you , pretty soon there 'd be none because the two of you would kill each other . 
oh , noise ? 
you will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing . 
you are going ? 
he struck me from under your arm . 
madam , your mother wants to talk to you . 
don 't saints and pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other girl did not love me . 
don i know 't , sir . 
curse your families ! 
teach me to forget to think ! 
why do you look so upset ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it makes me mad . 
she 's lying on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering . 
oh , you 're wrong . 
oh , go away ! 
go to your bedroom . 
benvolio is part of the montague family . 
maybe she can 't find him . 
i do . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news . 
let 's go at it , coward ! 
let me keep weeping for such a great loss . 
i have my naked sword out . 
wife ! 
and why , wise lady ? 
here comes the furious tybalt back again . 
you mean their cut off their heads , take their maidenheads-whatever . 
can 't you wait for a moment ? 
we 're ruined , lady , we 're ruined ! 
like , young man , don 't make me angry . 
i will kiss your lips . 
why would you do that , my love ? 
by nine o 'clock . 
gregory , remember how to slash . 
nurse , give my regards to to your lady . 
girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers . 
it 's good to have joy in such a joyless time and . 
where do you come from ? 
is my father well ? 
i hit hard when i 'm angry . 
oh , you are going to leave me so unsatisfied ? 
a greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan . 
then do my lips have now the sin they took from yours ? 
stop crying . 
it 's only nine o 'clock just now . 
oh cousin , cousin ! 
what should i swear by ? 
well , we were all born to die . 
if he hears you , you 'll make him angry . 
you should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide . 
don 't you have one word of joy ? 
you , prince , are the man who can give me justice . 
so get out of here ! 
be quiet , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way he did run ? 
i 'll follow after you . 
well , we can put away our pipes and go home . 
either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight . 
what , you don 't say a word ? 
then she is well , and nothing is wrong . 
my sweet , so do i. 
i swear , it must be thirty years . 
well , that one , i think , is young petruchio . 
wish me luck . 
what 's all the noise in here ? 
if i answered that question , i 'd be making confession to you . 
she 's dead , like a beautiful flower , killed by an unseasonable frost . 
that dirty rat ! 
what i 'm saying can 't anger him . 
you 're a lover . 
my dream told me that dreamers often lie . 
but why , you villain , did you kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then i 'll really give it to you . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo killed tybalt . 
leave me and do what i told you to do . 
give me your torch , boy . 
i 'm suddenly afraid . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous woman , a jealous woman ! 
what ? 
take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates . 
it 's all the same . 
i 've said nothing wrong . 
the excuse you make the news is longer than the news itself to delay . 
scathful thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men ! 
wait . 
are you biting your thumb at us ? 
i 'll bring you there . 
so what ? 
well , you 're not on target there . 
it 's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that . 
are you trying to start a fight ? 
i 'll fight you . 
tybalt , i have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage i should feel and excuse that insult . 
my husband is alive on earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven . 
i 'm done for in this world , i believe . 
gentle mercutio , put your sword away . 
shame on you ! 
i want to stay more than i want to go . 
give my regards to your lady , and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed . 
call to him , mercutio . 
she 's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven 's blessing by making me despair . 
why , what 's tybalt 's story ? 
two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away , and they 're asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return . on business 
whether it 's even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of lammas eve , she 'll be fourteen . 
you have killed tybalt ? 
you speak well . 
romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us . 
if i live to see you get married someday , all my wishes will come true . 
tell us what you can about this affair . 
i 'd give anything to keep them from seeing you here . 
do you think it 's a good idea to rush ? 
what will you give us ? 
angry enough to run away . 
the right . 
there 's plenty of time . 
my lord , you 're wrong to berate her like that . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who started this fight ? 
take a little vacation in mantua . 
what do you want ? 
sadness takes away our color . 
oh , that most wicked fiend ! 
i want my sword . 
get up , man ! 
come over here , nurse . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and then it 's good night for very . 
what 's going on , juliet ? 
death , which has taken away to make me cry , now ties up my tongue and let me speak 't won her . 
why are you waiting ? 
who greets me so early in the morning ? 
there has been never so black a day as today . 
i see . 
alright , let 's fight , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say about our marriage ? 
oh life ! 
what villain , madam ? 
give my compliments to your lady . 
i won 't miss any chance to send my love to you . 
i 'm only trying to keep the peace . 
can god be so jealous and hateful ? 
and everything will be alright , i promise you , wife . 
is the worst well ? 
oh , pardon me for bringing this bad news , but you told me it was my job , sir . 
i 've found it out . 
what if this mixture doesn 't work at all ? 
i thought it was the right thing to do . 
is love really tender ? 
that 's because the murderer is alive . 
good night . 
a woman more beautiful than the one i love ? 
not me , believe me . 
hold him in custody until the prince gets here . 
i won 't fail . 
oh , brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he told me paris was about to marry juliet . 
romeo ! 
i was even to you in the chase for the goose close ? 
it 's not the right time to play . 
go away and stay apart from me . 
mistress ! 
is it young romeo ? 
tell her to come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i can find young romeo ? 
i 'm done for . 
where are the evil men who started this fight ? 
then i revolt against you , stars ! 
his drugs work quickly . 
i 'm biting my thumb . 
peter ! 
here comes my man , the man i 'm looking for . 
well , what was your dream ? 
your mother is coming to your bedroom . 
hit them ! 
go there and like her to some other i 'll show you girls objectively . 
yes , i know her age down to the hour . 
you won 't , then ? 
oh wife , look how our daughter bleeds at ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's already almost night . 
give me that pickax and the crowbar . 
oh lord , they 're fighting ! 
my employer is as good as yours . 
come , come away .
