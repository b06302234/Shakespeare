I am no villain.
Give it to me!
You mean I should groan and tell you?
Curse the day!
He was not born to be shameful.
If I can trust my dreams, then some joyful news is coming soon.
Either you, or I, or both of us have to go with him.
He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed him.
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath?
Oh painful, painful, painful day!
Alright, here's the vial.
And what about that?
I'm glad he wasn't here for this fight.
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave!
But he's not better than mine.
Take me inside some house, Benvolio, or I'll pass out.
His love is blind, so it belongs in the dark.
I'm finished.
I can read my own fortune in my misery.
I scolded you for obsessing about her, not for loving her, my student.
Oh love!
Welcome back from Mantua.
I'll bite you on the ear for that joke.
Welcome, gentlemen.
Hold the friar too.
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio.
Did he get away clean?
Can't I say something?
Well, sir, because silver has a sweet sound.
I'll frown at them as they pass by, and they can react however they want.
Romeo will answer the challenge.
In my desperate situation, I have to act alone.
Madam, I'm here.
Now, I swear, I'm so angry that I'm shaking all over.
As I slept under this yew-tree here, I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him.
Is it that early in the day?
Romeo is hateful, even though God isn't.
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this?
So I die with a kiss.
But here come some people, right in the nick of time.
I'll make you sing.
I wish I was your bird.
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter.
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave?
Don't you have a letter for me from the friar?
Peter, wait for me at the gate.
Go tell him about this.
What do you say, James  Well, I don't know what to say.
I'll go call the watch.
What will we say is our excuse for being here?
Give me my sin back.
Who is her mother?
I'll confess to you that I love him.
Young man, something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early.
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together those twenty could only kill one man.
Seriously, cousin, I love a woman.
Investigate how this foul murder came about.
What a man, young lady.
If love is blind, it can't hit the target.
Perhaps you've learned from life and not from books.
Tybalt was my nephew!
Where the devil can Romeo be?
As I remember, this should be the house.
You're getting too angry.
Shame on Romeo!
Tell me, my good friend, what is that light over there?
Who's that calling so loud?
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave.
Oh pain!
Now he's ready for
Is it really true?
That's very soon.
Only to be generous and give it to you once more.
Where is my mother?
Monday!
To our house.
What have you found out?
That's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is.
Are you going to join them?
You can't talk about something that you don't feel.
Can I go away while my heart stays here?
Look, sir, here comes the lady walking toward my cell.
Yes, madam, he lies beyond my reach.
What is the matter?
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest.
No, not until Thursday.
I'll give him equal thanks, so we're even.
Be quiet, you mumbling fool!
Tell me, how did you get in here?
Tell me, my daughter Juliet, what is your attitude about getting married?
You were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose.
Or should we enter without apologizing?
Romeo, get out of here.
This is a pitiful sight!
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears?
Well, well, I don't care.
Can't you find a reason without my giving you one?
That's him, that villain Romeo.
Do you need my help?
Oh my, Oh my!
Come on, what did Romeo say?
His son was a minor only two years ago.
Nurse!
Take this.
Come on!
Hey!
But what do you say to my request?
We're talking here in a public place.
You're in love?
He looks skinny, like a dried herring without its eggs, and he hasn't got his girl.
Oh, my!
You lie.
Have a nice day!
I don't know, and he won't tell me.
No, my good lord.
Your life insurance?
What does Romeo say?
Saint Francis, help me!
Hide yourself, good Romeo.
What do you mean I faked you out?
I am the youngest man by that name, because there is no one younger, or worse.
Father, what's the news?
It's still a long time until daybreak.
You will also confess, I'm sure, that you love me.
Hey, bride!
Have you told her our decision?
I bet it's a challenge.
Well, may peace be with you.
Dinner is over, and we're going to get there too late.
You're not taking one step toward an enemy.
What, are you hurt?
Look, she's come home from confession with a happy look on her face.
Then who took my letter to Romeo?
Virginity makes her look sick and green.
It's late.
Don't you see that I'm out of breath?
Do as I tell you.
If we look like musicians to you, you can expect to hear nothing but noise.
Isn't she proud of such a match?
Oh, what a sad day!
Don't deny to him that you love me.
How can you test them like that?
The boy is warning me that someone approaches.
Why, may I ask?
But whatever misfortunes occur, they can't ruin the joy I feel with one look at her.
May God choose you to receive his grace.
Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me.
No, cousin, I'm crying.
She will  A pimp!
Give my regards to your daughter.
Do you bring me a letter from the friar?
Good morning to you both.
Hurry up, it's getting late.
From now on, take care of your messages yourself.
Are you going to provoke me?
Where are they supposed to come?
Yes, boy, I'm ready.
Oh heavens!
Won't he?
For a full half hour.
She's ready to go, but she'll never return.
Don't worry about me.
How should madmen hear, if wise men can't even see?
She disgusts me, the little hussy!
They're calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen.
Oh, sad day!
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well.
The  Get out of here!
My soul depends on it- A thousand times good night.
I know all of this.
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears?
Up.
By my count, I was already your mother at just about your age, while you remain a virgin.
What's this noise?
O flesh, flesh, you've turned pale and weak like a fish.
Please, sir, have patience.
Are you a man?
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are, my life insurance rates would be sky high.
I hear some noise.
Start a fight?
You should go to Juliet and dress her up.
Well, start thinking about marriage now.
Yes, pilgrim-they have lips that they're supposed to pray with.
Oh, rude and unthankful boy!
That's the way to show me friendship.
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed.
Why are you knocking so hard?
Yes, that's true.
Just look at me kindly, and I'm invincible against their hatred.
I hear a noise inside.
Hang out?" Who do you think we are, musicians in a band?
Come here, man.
Am I really like one of those guys?
Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder.
I'll go, sir, and I won't bother you.
What further pain must I endure in my old age?
Whose house?
No, noble Romeo, you've got to dance.
God bless you!
Answer me like men.
God in heaven bless her!
I know where he is.
Down with the Montagues!
How long has he been there?
No matter.
Do you love me?
Oh, deadly sin!
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began.
But I'm wishing for something I already have.
I don't know his name.
Farewell!
Answer that question.
Send your man away.
Give me some comfort, Nurse.
This is good.
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover?
Why are you acting so angry?
May God in heaven bless you.
That might be the case sir,
Madam!
It was.
Go with me to the tomb.
Your mother.
Lose nothing?
Down with the Capulets!
Who is it?
Excuse me, sir, do you know how to read?
Amen!
My noble uncle, do you know why he acts this way?
Goodbye, cousin.
Why, she's inside.
Or, if he wrote down his thoughts, give me his letter.
Why the hell did you come in between us?
You're not paying attention to me.
So the cooks who can't lick their fingers aren't hired.
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life?
Where is my Romeo?
Now please listen, sir.
Have you spoken to him?
That's really news!
It's a sweet lozenge that you choke on.
Where is she?
Give me my fan, Peter.
I'll come with you.
No, sir.
Come on, wake up, wake up, wake up!
She's talking, but she's not saying anything.
Oh my!
For when you cut your shin.
Are you really going to tell me that?
What do you think about Thursday?
That sounds like the voice of Friar John.
Do as you please, because I'm done worrying about you.
Wait, Tybalt, wait!
But I would kill you by petting you too much.
Let me stand here until you remember your reason.
I will be brief because I'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story.
Let me talk to you about your situation.
Isn't that what he said?
Take my remark in whichever sense you like.
Yes, well, things could get better.
Forget about him, Jack!
Nurse?
Good man, why are you crying?
Can your man keep a secret?
What?
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught.
He knows what?
I'll answer for you.
Now you know the reason for the rush.
It's the lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise.
You're an insolent little boy.
I remember very well where I should be, and here I am.
Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris.
Unhappy fortune!
But I am thankful that you have found it.
What else is love?
Lie down right there.
No.
Well then.
How is my Juliet?
Well then, I'll say this quickly: the valiant Paris wants you as his bride.
Then you were right on target.
Monday, my lord.
Were you talking about Juliet?
Don't say anything else.
You know too much about suffering.
What?
Where else would she be?
Good morning, gentlemen.
You'll find me ready enough to do that, sir, if you give me a reason.
Stand up.
Hold on, then.
Good night, good night.
How is she?
That's foolish.
Why, isn't all this joking better than groaning about love?
Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight.
Has Romeo killed himself?
On Thursday, sir?
You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life.
Hurry up, or I'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn.
What, are you busy?
So did I.
And trust me, love, you look pale to me too.
You worthless girl!
Give me your hand.
What are you, girl?
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry?
How is my wife?
Use your clubs and spears!
Oh my!
What is this?
This fight will decide who dies.
Tybalt is lying over there.
My eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight.
I have forgotten why I called you back.
The citizens are around, and Tybalt is dead.
If there were two men like you, pretty soon there'd be none because the two of you would kill each other.
Oh, noise?
You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for will feel nothing.
Are you going?
He struck me from under your arm.
Madam, your mother wants to talk to you.
Don't saints and pilgrims have lips too?
The other girl did not love me.
I don't know, sir.
Curse your families!
Teach me to forget to think!
Why do you look so upset?
Madam, I am not well.
It makes me mad.
She's lying on the ground just like him, blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Oh, you're wrong.
Oh, go away!
Go to your bedroom.
Benvolio is part of the Montague family.
Maybe she can't find him.
I do.
Tell him so yourself, and see how he takes the news.
Let's go at it, coward!
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss.
I have my naked sword out.
Wife!
And why, wise lady?
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
You mean their  Cut off their heads, take their maidenheads-whatever.
Can't you wait for a moment?
We're ruined, lady, we're ruined!
Please, young man, don't make me angry.
I will kiss your lips.
Why would you do that, my love?
By nine o'clock.
Gregory, remember how to slash.
Nurse, give my regards to to your lady.
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers.
And it's good to have joy in such a joyless time.
Where do you come from?
Is my father well?
I hit hard when I'm angry.
Oh, are you going to leave me so unsatisfied?
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan.
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours?
Stop crying.
It's only just now nine o'clock.
Oh cousin, cousin!
What should I swear by?
Well, we were all born to die.
If he hears you, you'll make him angry.
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide.
Don't you have one word of joy?
You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice.
So get out of here!
Be quiet, for shame!
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?
I'll follow after you.
Well, we can put away our pipes and go home.
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight.
What, you don't say a word?
Then she is well, and nothing is wrong.
My sweet, so do I.
I swear, it must be thirty years.
Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio.
Wish me luck.
What's all the noise in here?
If I answered that question, I'd be making confession to you.
She's dead, like a beautiful flower, killed by an unseasonable frost.
That dirty rat!
What I'm saying can't anger him.
You're a lover.
My dream told me that dreamers often lie.
But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin?
Madam, good night.
Then I'll really give it to you.
Give me those flowers.
Romeo killed Tybalt.
Leave me and do what I told you to do.
Give me your torch, boy.
I'm suddenly afraid.
Here comes your father.
A jealous woman, a jealous woman!
What?
Take away the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.
It's all the same.
I've said nothing wrong.
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself.
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men!
Wait.
Are you biting your thumb at us?
I'll bring you there.
So what?
Well, you're not on target there.
It's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that.
Are you trying to start a fight?
I'll fight you.
Tybalt, I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult.
My husband is alive on earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven.
I'm done for in this world, I believe.
Noble Mercutio, put your sword away.
Shame on you!
I want to stay more than I want to go.
Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed.
Call to him, Mercutio.
She's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair.
Why, what's Tybalt's story?
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business, and they're asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return.
Whether it's even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she'll be fourteen.
Have you killed Tybalt?
You speak well.
Romeo will thank you, my girl, for both of us.
If I live to see you get married someday, all my wishes will come true.
Tell us what you know about this affair.
I'd give anything to keep them from seeing you here.
Do you think it's a good idea to rush?
What will you give us?
Angry enough to run away.
The  Right.
There's plenty of time.
My lord, you're wrong to berate her like that.
Farewell.
Benvolio, who started this fight?
Take a little vacation in Mantua.
What do you want?
Sadness takes away our color.
Oh, that most wicked fiend!
I want my sword.
Get up, man!
Come over here, nurse.
Come, death, and welcome!
Three words, dear Romeo, and then it's good night for real.
What's going on, Juliet?
Death, which has taken her away to make me cry, now ties up my tongue and won't let me speak.
Why are you waiting?
Who greets me so early in the morning?
There has never been so black a day as today.
I see.
Alright, let's fight, boy!
Romeo.
What does he say about our marriage?
Oh life!
What villain, madam?
Give my compliments to your lady.
I won't miss any chance to send my love to you.
I'm only trying to keep the peace.
Can God be so jealous and hateful?
And everything will be alright, I promise you, wife.
Is the worst well?
Oh, pardon me for bringing this bad news, but you told me it was my job, sir.
I've found it out.
What if this mixture doesn't work at all?
I thought it was the right thing to do.
Is love really tender?
That's because the murderer is alive.
Good night.
A woman more beautiful than the one I love?
Not me, believe me.
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here.
I won't fail.
Oh, brother Montague, give me your hand.
We found him in the churchyard.
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet.
Romeo!
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose?
It's not the right time to play.
Go away and stay apart from me.
Mistress!
Is it young Romeo?
Tell her to come to me.
Look, and you'll see.
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo?
I'm done for.
Where are the evil men who started this fight?
Then I rebel against you, stars!
His drugs work quickly.
I'm biting my thumb.
Peter!
Here comes my man, the man I'm looking for.
Well, what was your dream?
Your mother is coming to your bedroom.
Hit them!
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I'll show you.
Yes, I know her age down to the hour.
You won't, then?
Oh wife, look at how our daughter bleeds!
Romeo is coming.
It's already almost night.
Give me that pickax and the crowbar.
Oh Lord, they're fighting!
My employer is as good as yours.
Come, come away.
