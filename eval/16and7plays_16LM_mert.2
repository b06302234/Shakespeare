i am not a villain .

what , shall i groan and tell you ? 
she 's dead , pitiful day ! 
he was not born to shame . 
if i may trust the event while i slept , my dreams bode some joyful news is coming . 
either thee or i , or two of us , must go with him . 
there lies the man slain by young romeo , that killed your cousin , brave mercutio . 
how dost thou out of breath , when you have breath to say to me that you are out of breath ? 
o woeful , woeful , woeful day ! 
come , vial . 
and what ? 
i am very glad he was would not at this fight . 
i would the foolish wench wedded to her grave ! 
no better ? 
help me into some house , benvolio , or i shall fall . 
his love is blind and it becomes the dark best . 
i am done . 
ay , my own fortune in my woes . 
for doting , not for loving , my pupil . 
o love ! 
welcome in mantua . 
i will sting thee on the ear for that jest ! 
welcome , gentlemen ! 
hold the friar too . 
the son and heir of old tiberio . 
is he gone , and he hath nothing ? 
can would not one speak ? 
marry , sir , for silver hath a sweet sound . 
let them take it what way they will . 
romeo will answer it . 
i must act my dreadful scene alone . 
madam , i am here . 
now , before god , i am so wrath that every part of me quivers . 
as i was sleeping under this tree yew here , i did dream that my master and another fought , and that my master slew him . 
good morrow , cousin is it morning ? 
romeo can , though heaven cannot . 
what devil art thou so wonder me thus ? 
so , i die with a kiss . 
take some new infection to your eye , and the estates poison of the old love shall die . 
i will would not any hooked instruments . 
i would i were your bird . 
any man that can write may answer a letter . 
did a dragon ever keep so fair a cavern ? 
do you would not letters to me from the friar ? 
peter , stay at the gate . 
go tell him of this . 
faith , i would not know what to say . 
i 'll go call the watch . 
what shall we give as our excuse ? 
give me my sin again . 
who is her mother ? 
i will confess to thee that i love him . 
young son , it is arguably a distempered head that bids good morrow so soon to your bed . 
some twenty of them fought in this black fight , and all those twenty could but take one life . 
in melancholy , cousin , i do love a woman . 
search , seek , and know how this foul murder chanced . 
a man , young lady ! 
if love is blind , love can would not find the mint . 
perchance you have learned it without book . 
tybalt , my cousin ! 
where the devil can this romeo be ? 
as i remember , this should be the house . 
you are too hot under the collar . 
shame come to romeo ! 
tell me , good my friend , what torch is yonder that wastes giving his light to grubs and eyeless skull ? 
who is wishest so loud ? 
every one should prepare to follow this fair corse to her grave . 
o woe ! 
now he is for the sense that petrarch flowed in ! 
is it so ? 
that 's very shortly . 
but to be honest and give it to thee again . 
where is my mother ? 
monday ! 
to supper ; to our house . 
what hast thou found ? 
godden to my ghostly confessor . 
will you go to them ? 
you may would not speak of something you do would not feel . 
shall i go home when my heart is here ? 
look , sir , here the lady is coming toward my cell . 
ay , madam , from the pelt of my hands . 
what 's the matter ? 
a right fair mark , fair coz , is the first hit . 
no , not till thursday . 
as much to him , else his thanks is too much . 
peace , you mumbling fool ! 
by a name that i would not know how to tell you that i am . 
tell me , daughter juliet , what do you think of married ? 
you were never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose . 
or shall we do but go on without any apology ? 
romeo , leave , be gone ! 
miserable sight ! 
what , will you wash him from his grave with tears ? 
by my heel , i care not . 
would not you take some occasion without my giving you one ? 
it is he , that villain , romeo . 
do you need my help ? 
o me , o me ! 
come , what says romeo say ? 
his son was but a ward two years ago . 
nurse ! 
take thee that . 
what , lamb ! 
what , ho ! 
but now , my lord , what say you to my request ? 
we 're talking here in a common place . 
in love ? 
without his fish eggs , like a dried herring . 
o romeo , romeo ! 
you 're lied ! 
have a good day ! 
i would not know and he will would not tell me . 
no , my good lord . 
the rash estate ! 
what says romeo say ? 
saint francis be my speed ! 
good romeo , withdraw yourself . 
what false take did i give thee ? 
i am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse name . 
father , what news ? 
it 's not morning yet . 
so will you confess , i am sure , that thou lovest me . 
why , bride ! 
have you told her what we have concluded for her ? 
a challenge , upon my life . 
well , peace be with you , sir . 
supper is done , and we shall come too late . 
you will not move one foot to fight ! 
what , are you hurt ? 
see how she comes from confession with a happy face . 
the , that took my letter to romeo ? 
her chaste , white gown is but sick and green , and fools wear it . 
it 's late . 
do you would not see that i 'm out of breath ? 
go , do what i have told thee . 
if you make us musicians , look to hear nothing but noise . 
is she would not proud ? 
o heavy day ! 
do would not deny to him that thou lovest me . 
how can see ' em ? 
the boy gives the warning something is expiate . 
why , may one ask ? 
but what sorrow can come , it cannot equivocal the exchange of joy that one short minute in her sight gives me . 
god mark you for his grace ! 
do so , and bid my sweet to prepare to chide me . 
no , cousin , i 'ld rather cry . 
she will give him a writ parley to some supper . 
commend me to your daughter . 
do would not thou bring me letters from the friar ? 
good morrow to you both . 
dispatch , make rashness , for it grows very late . 
from this time forth do your messages yourself . 
will you yet tarre me ? 
where should they come ? 
ay , boy , ready . 
o heaven ! 
what , you 're suited ! 
a full half hour . 
ready to go , but never to return . 
do would not fear me . 
how should they , when wise men have no eyes ? 
throw her forth , the good for nothing ! 
they 're imploring dates and quinces in the pastry . 
o lamentable day ! 
i 'll ask that again ; for nothing can be wrong if she is well . 
fie upon thee ! 
i 'll tarry , a thousand times good night ! 
what can he say of this ? 
they wash his wounds with tears . 
up . 
by my count i was your mother pretty near the age that you are now . 
what 's playing ? 
o flesh , flesh , how dost thou fishified ! 
i pray you , sir , have patience . 
are you a man ? 
if i were so easy to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the rash estate of my life for an hour and a quarter . 
i hear some noise . 
fight , sir ! 
you go to juliet , help her ready . 
well , think of marriage now . 
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . 
o rude unthankfulness ! 
this way you show me love . 
he is wise ; and , upon my life , he hath stol 'n home to bed . 
who knocks so hard ? 
ay , she indeed did . 
if you will but look demurely , then i am protected against their hate . 
i hear some noise within . 
what , do you make us musicians ? 
come hither , man . 
am i such a fellow ? 
ay , ay , the cords . 
i 'll go , sir , and not trouble thee . 
what additional sorrow conspires against my age ? 
whose house ? 
no , gentle romeo , we must have you jig . 
blessings on you ! 
answer me like men . 
god in heaven bless her ! 
i know well where he is . 
down with the montagues ! 
how long hath he been in there ? 
no matter . 
do you love me ? 
o deadly sin ! 
the all-seeing sun never saw nothing to match her since the world first began . 
and yet i would but for the thing that i have . 
i would not know . 
farewell ! 
answer that . 
send thy man away . 
give me some comfort , nurse . 
this is great . 
was ever a book containing such vile matter so how but well bound ? 
why do you storm so ? 
now god in heaven bless thee ! 
you may call me that , sir , when i may be a wife . 
madam ! 
it was . 
go with me to the monument . 
thy mother . 
what say you ? 
down with the capulets ! 
who is it ? 
good day.-please tell me , sir , can you read ? 
amen ! 
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ? 
farewell , my coz . 
why , she 's within . 
or , if he wrote his mind , give me his letter . 
to romeo &ket; why the devil did you come between us ? 
you do would not understand me . 
therefore , he that cannot lick his fingers will would not come back with me . 
who now oweth to the price of his dear blood ? 
where is my romeo ? 
hark , sir . 
have you met with him ? 
this is news indeed ! 
a noyance most discreet , a â€™ s point and choke acid , and a preserving sweet . 
where is she ? 
my fan , peter . 
i 'll go along . 
no , sir . 
come , let 's avaunt ! 
she speaks , but she says nothing . 
ay me ! 
your plantain-leaf is excellent for that . 
will you tell me that ? 
but what say you to thursday ? 
this is the voice of friar john . 
what do you mean to do , for i 'm done with you . 
tarry , tybalt , soft ! 
but i should kill thee with much cherishing . 
let me stand here till you remember . 
i will be brief , for i would not have enough breath to this tedious tale . 
let me expostulate with you of thy complaining . 
did he say it ? 
take it any way you please . 
ay , by my troth , the case may be amended . 
the hell with him , jack sauce ! 
nurse ? 
good heart , at what ? 
can your man keep counsel ? 
what ? 
the prince will sentence you to death if you are taken prisoner . 
the what ? 
i will say it for you . 
now you know why we 're in haste . 
it is the lark that sings so out of tune , straining to sing horrible songs and unpleasing notes . 
you are a saucy boy . 
i remember well where i should be , and here i am . 
an eagle , madam , is not as green , as quick , nor hath would not so fair an eye as paris hath . 
very ill luck ! 
i 'm not proud that you have , but i 'm thankful that you have . 
what is it else ? 
you lie there . 
no . 
well , sir . 
how fares my juliet ? 
thus , then , here it is ; the valiant paris seeks you for his love . 
a right good marksman ! 
monday , my lord . 
did you speak of juliet ? 
talk no more . 
my dear son is too familiar with such sour company . 
what , is your sword forth among these foolish servants ? 
where should she be ? 
good morrow , masters . 
you shall find me easy enough for that , sir , if you will give me the occasion . 
stand up . 
stay , then . 
good night , good night ! 
how is it with her ? 
o how honest ! 
why , is would not this better now than groaning for love ? 
you hark : your romeo will be here at night . 
hath romeo killed himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
your part in her thou couldst not keep from death , but heaven keeps his part in eternal life . 
dispatch , lest my sword will be of your ears before you get yours out . 
what , art thou busy , ho ? 
and so did i. 
and trust me , love , in mine eyes , so do you . 
out , thou poke of offal ! 
give me your hand . 
what 's playing ? 
was that my father that went away so fast ? 
how does my lady ? 
cudgels , pikes , and more pikes ! 
o me ! 
what is this ? 
this fight shall determine that . 
there lies that same tybalt . 
for i never saw true beauty till this night . 
i have forgot why i called you in again . 
the citizens are up , and tybalt is dead . 
nay , if there were two such fellows , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other . 
ay , noise ? 
you 'll feel the loss , but not the loss of the friend you weep for . 
are you going ? 
i was hurt under your arm . 
madam , your mother craves a word with you . 
do would not saints and holy pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other did would not . 
i know not , sir . 
your houses ! 
o , teach me how i should forget to think . 
why are you wringing your hands ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it makes me angry . 
she lies the catalogue , blubbering and weep , weeping and blubbering . 
otherwise , you would have made your tale large . 
o , away ! 
hie thee to thy chamber . 
this is the truth , or let benvolio die . 
perchance she can would not meet him . 
i have . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it from you . 
fight me , coward ! 
let me weep for feeling such a loss . 
it 's out already ! 
wife ! 
and wherefore are you butting in , my lady wisdom ? 
here comes the furious tybalt again . 
ay , the heads of maids , or their chaste treasure open . 
can would not you rest awhile ? 
we are marred , lady , we are marred ! 
i pray you , youth , do would not put another sin on my head by urging me to fight . 
i will kiss your lips . 
why , love ? 
at nine . 
you do would not know what you 're doing ! 
nurse , commend me to your lady and mistress . 
younger girls than she are made happy mothers . 
and joy is received in such a needy time . 
where do you come from ? 
is my father well ? 
i can hit quickly , if i 'm full of purpose . 
o , will you leave me so unstanched ? 
a greater power than we can contradict hath opposed our complots . 
then , do my lips have the sin that they have taken from yours ? . 
so stop crying . 
it 's 9 am . 
o coz , coz ! 
what shall i swear by ? 
well , we were born to die . 
if he hears you , you will make him angry . 
be patient , for the world is broad and wide . 
do would not you have any word of joy ? 
i pray for justice , which you , prince , must give ; romeo killed tybalt . 
get you gone , hence , leave ! 
peace , ho , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ? 
i will follow you . 
in faith , we may put up our pipes and get you home . 
put up your sword , or use it to help me break up this fight . 
what , not a word ? 
then she is well , and nothing can be wrong . 
sweet , so do i. 
by ' r lady , thirty years . 
marry , that , i think , is young petruchio . 
go quickly to high fortune ! 
what noise is here ? 
to answer that question , i should confess to you . 
death lies upon her like an untimely frost on the sweetest rose in all the fields . 
scurvy knave ! 
this cannot anger him . 
i cannot move . 
that dreamers oft lie . 
but wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then , i 'll give it to thee as fee . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo slew him ; he killed mercutio . 
leave me , and do as i ask you . 
give me your torch , boy . 
fear comes over me . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous spy , a jealous spy ! 
for what , i pray you tell me ? 
away with the good stools , remove the china wardrobe lies , look to the plate . 
makes no difference . 
i 'm not telling a lie . 
the excuse that you make in this delay is longer than the tale you excuse . 
o mischief , thou art quick to enter into the thoughts of desperate men ! 
what ! 
didst thou give the finger to us , sir ? 
i will bring you there . 
what does this mean ? 
well , in that hit , you miss . 
the time is of such a dry duration . 
are you powers above put on their instruments a fight with us , sir ? 
i am for you . 
tybalt , the reason that i have to love you does excuse much the rage that is sorting with such a greeting . 
my husband is on earth , my fay in heaven . 
i am not long , i warrant , for this world . 
gentle mercutio , put up your sword . 
fie , fie ! 
i have more care to stay than will to go . 
commend me to thy lady ; and bid her to haste the whole house to bed , which heavy sorrow makes them more like to do . 
call him , good mercutio . 
she is too fair , too wise ; wisely too fair , to earn her own happiness by making me proclaims . 
why , what is tybalt ? 
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , having some business , do importune her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till the stars return . 
couple of days or not , of all days in the year , come the midst of july , she 'll be fourteen . 
have you killed tybalt ? 
you say well . 
romeo shall thank you , daughter , for us both . 
if i live to see you married , i have my wish . 
then tell what you know of all of this . 
i would would not have them see you here for the world . 
dost thou like this speed ? 
what will you give us ? 
but you 're not quickly full of purpose to hit . 
no , i am the very final angle of courtesy . 
there 's foison of time . 
you are to blame , my lord , to berate her thus . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who began this bloody fight ? 
post to of mantua . 
what is need you ? 
thirsty sorrow carouses our blood . 
o most wicked , pernicious woman ! 
my sword , i say ! 
what , awake , man ! 
come hither , nurse . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . 
why , how dost thou , juliet ? 
death , that hath ta 'en her away to make me wail , ties up my tongue and will not let me speak . 
why do you stay ? 
what early tongue so sweetly recommends me ? 
a day black as this hath never been seen ! 
you speak truly . 
then , i 'll get thee , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say of our marriage ? 
o life ! 
what villain , madam ? 
commend me to your lady . 
i will would not miss a chance to send you my greeting , love . 
i 'm received to keep the peace . 
can heaven be so jealous ? 
i will work it out , and all will be well , i warrant you , wife . 
ay , is the worst well ? 
o , forgive me for bringing you this sad news , since you did leave it all up to me , sir . 
so ho ! 
what if this mingle doth would not work at all ? 
methought it was all for the best . 
is love a tender thing ? 
that is for the traitor murderer lives . 
good night . 
one fairer than my love ? 
not i , believe me . 
hold him in safety till the prince found . 
i will not fail ! 
o brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he told me paris was going to wed juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i with you there for the goose ? 
this is no time to play . 
away , and stand yonder . 
mistress ! 
young romeo , is it ? 
call her to come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo ? 
i have had it , and soundly too . 
where are the wicked beginners of this fight ? 
then , i defy you , stars ! 
your syrups are quick . 
i did give the finger , sir . 
peter ! 
here comes my man . 
well , what was yours ? 
your lady mother is coming to your bedchamber . 
strike ! 
let 's go , and with plainer eye , compare her face with some other that i shall show you , and i will make you think your swan is a crow . 
believe me , i can tell her age to the hour . 
will you would not play then ? 
o wife , look how our daughter bleeds ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's almost night now . 
give me that chisel-edged take and the iron wrench . 
o lord , they 're fighting ! 
i serve as good a man as you do . 
come , come away !
