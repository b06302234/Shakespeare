stay , tybalt , stand ! 
but i would pay you for petting you too much . 
let me rest here until you know your reason .

the prince will give you the end answer that you take caught . 
he knows what ? 
i 'll answer to you . 
now you know the cause of the fly . 
it 's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such sharp cry . 
you 're an immodest little boy . 
i know too well where i should be , and here i am . 
madam , an eagle does not have eyes to ground , as free , and as fair as the eyes of paris . 
sick fortune ! 
but i am thankful that you have found it . 
what else is love ? 
lie down good there . 
no .

where else would she be ? 
good morrow , gentlemen . 
you 'll find me light enough to make that , sir , that you give me a cause . 
stand up . 
hold on , then . 
good night , good night . 
how is she ? 
that 's fool . 
why , isn 't all this pleasant better than groaning of love ? 
list , your romeo will be here tonight . 
has romeo dead himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
you could not stay her of dead someday , but heaven will make her divine time . 
haste up , or i 'll smack you by the ears of my sword before you have yours drawn . 
what , are you busy ? 
so did i. 
and take me , love , you look pale at me too . 
you base wench ! 
give me your hand . 
what are you , she ? 
was as my father who left here in such a haste ? 
how is my wife ? 
lay your beams and pikes ! 
o my ! 
what is this ? 
this war will determine who dies . 
tybalt is lying over there . 
my eyes were liars , then , for i never saw very fair or tonight . 
i have forgotten why i called you again . 
the citizens are abroad , and tybalt is dead . 
if there were two men with you , pretty soon there 'd be none for the two of you would kill each other . 
o , cry ? 
you will pass the loss , but the man you weep for will pass nothing . 
are you going ? 
he struck me from under your arm . 
madam , your mother occasions to come to you . 
don 't saints and pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other she did not love me . 
i don 't know , sir . 
beshrew your families ! 
teach me to forget a judge ! 
why do you think so wild ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it gives me mad . 
she 's lying on the ground but with him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering . 
o , you 're out . 
o , go away ! 
go to your chamber . 
benvolio is kind of the montague house . 
perchance she can 't like him . 
i do . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news . 
let 's go in it , coward ! 
let me stay weeping of such a great loss . 
i have my naked sword out . 
fellow ! 
and why , grave she ? 
here comes the wild tybalt back again . 
you think their cut off their heads , have their maidenheads-whatever . 
can 't you stand for a charge ? 
we 're undone , lady , we 're undone ! 
content , young man , don 't make me out . 
i will kiss your lips . 
why would you do that , my love ? 
for nine o 'clock . 
gregory , know how a scotch . 
nurse , make my desire to to your lady . 
girls younger than she oft bride and be happy dames . 
and it 's good to have comfort in such a joyless time . 
where do you make of ? 
is my father well ? 
i take much that i 'm out . 
o , are you going to leave me so unsatisfied ? 
a greater power than we can speak has undone our purpose . 
then make my lips now have the fault they took of yours ? 
stand crying . 
it 's but even now nine o 'clock . 
o cousin , cousin ! 
what should i swear by ? 
well , we were all born to die . 
and he hears you , you 'll make him mad . 
you should be able to endure this for the time is large and wide . 
don 't you have one word in joy ? 
you , prince , are the man who can make me justice . 
so take out of here ! 
be quiet , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ? 
i 'll go after you . 
well , we can turn away our pipes and go home . 
either turn away your sword or lay it to help me leave this war . 
what , ye don 't say a word ? 
then she is fair , and nothing is out . 
my sweet , so do i. 
i swear , it must be thirty years . 
well , but one , i think , is young petruchio . 
will me hap . 
what 's all the noise of here ? 
and i returned as sound , i 'd be making confession to you . 
she 's dead , like a fair flower , dead with an unseasonable frost . 
that foul rat ! 
what i 'm word can 't blood him . 
you 're a friend . 
my dream told me that dreamers often lodge . 
but why , you slave , did you kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then i 'll good give it to you . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo dead tybalt . 
leave me and do what i told you to do . 
give me your torch , boy . 
i 'm suddenly afeard . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous woman , a jealous woman ! 
what ? 
take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates . 
it 's all the like . 
i 've said nothing ill . 
the answer you give to stay the news is higher than the noise itself . 
fell thoughts make ready to the minds of desperate men ! 
stand . 
are you sudden your thumb in us ? 
i 'll bring you there . 
so what ? 
well , you 're not a mark there . 
it 's out of fashion to make lingering reasons with that . 
are you trying to meet a war ? 
i 'll speak you . 
tybalt , i have a cause to love you that lets me lay by the spirit i should pass and answer that wrong . 
my husband is quick in earth , my vows of marriage are of heaven . 
i 'm done to of this world , i trust . 
great mercutio , put your sword away . 
shame on you ! 
i want to go more than i want to go . 
make my desire to your lady , and bring her to whip everybody of the house to bed . 
write to him , mercutio . 
she 's too fair and too wise to win heaven 's blessing in making me despair . 
why , what 's tybalt 's argument ? 
two of the brightest stars of the whole heavens had to go away in question , and they 're asking her eyes to twinkle of their offices until they return . 
where it 's meet or odd , of all the days of the year , in the night of lammas eve , she 'll be fourteen . 
have you dead tybalt ? 
you say well . 
romeo will thank you , my girl , to both of us . 
as i live to see you take married someday , all my wishes will make true . 
tell us what you know of this business . 
i 'd give aught to keep them from seeing you here . 
do you think it 's a good conceit to fly ? 
what will you make us ? 
sharp enough to run away . 
the good . 
there 's store of time . 
my lord , you 're out a tongue her with that . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who offered this war ? 
have a little vacation in mantua . 
what do you want ? 
weight takes away our color . 
o , that most heavy fiend ! 
i want my sword . 
take up , sir ! 
come over here , keeper . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and then it 's good night to good . 
what 's going on , juliet ? 
death , which has taken her away to make me cry , now knits up my tongue and won 't let me speak . 
why are you waiting ? 
who greets me so early in the morning ? 
there has never been so black a day to today . 
i see . 
alright , let 's fight , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say of our marriage ? 
o world ! 
what villain , madam ? 
make my commendation to your lady . 
i won 't lack any chance to turn my love to you . 
i 'm but trying to keep the peace . 
can god be so jealous and detested ? 
and everything will be alright , i warrant you , fellow . 
is the worst well ? 
o , pardon me for bringing this ill news , but you told me it was my hand , sir . 
i 've found it out . 
what if this mixture doesn 't hand at all ? 
i thought it was the good thing to do . 
is like good gentle ? 
that 's as the murderer is alive . 
good night . 
a woman more beautiful than the one i love ? 
not me , take me . 
give him at court until the prince takes here . 
i won 't fall . 
o , brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he told me paris was about to marry juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i meet hard to you in the course of the goose ? 
it 's not the good day to play . 
go away and go apart of me . 
love ! 
is it young romeo ? 
bring her to come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i can find young romeo ? 
i 'm done to . 
where are the ill men who offered this war ? 
then i cry of you , stars ! 
his medicine hand ready . 
i 'm sudden my thumb . 
peter ! 
here comes my man , the man i 'm looking for . 
well , what was your dream ? 
your mother is coming to your chamber . 
take them ! 
go there and set her coldly to some other girls i 'll give you . 
yes , i know her time down at the day . 
you won 't , then ? 
o peer , like a how our daughter bloods ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's first like night . 
give me that pickax and the crow . 
o lord , they 're rage ! 
my manager is as good as yours . 
come , come away .
