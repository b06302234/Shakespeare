there lies as like tybalt . 
for i never saw very fair till this night . 
i have forgotten why i called you again . 
the citizens are up , and tybalt is dead .

and comfort is welcomed of such a bare time . 
where do you come from ? 
is my father well ? 
i can take ready , and i 'm motivated . 
o , will you give over me so unsatisfied ? 
a more power than we can cross has opposed our purposes . 
then , do my lips have the fault that they have taken of yours ? . 
so stand crying . 
it 's 9 am . 
o cousin , cousin ! 
what shall i swear by ?

peace , ho , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way he did run ? 
i will follow you .

o mischief , you are ready to meddle with the thoughts of desperate men ! 
what ! 
did you make the point to us , sir ? 
i will bring you there . 
what does that mean ? 
well , in that take , you lose . 
the time is of such a boring date .

gentle mercutio , put up your sword . 
for shame , for shame ! 
i have more care to go than will to go . 
commend me to thy lady ; and bid her to the house to bed , which makes them more like to do sorrow deep haste together . 
give him , good mercutio . 
she is fair , grave wisely too fair , to get her own content in making me despair ; too too . 
why , what is tybalt ? 
two of the fairest stars of all the heaven , having some cause , do entreat her eyes to twinkle of their sphere till the stars answer . 
yoke of age , of all the year , make the deep in july , she 'll be fourteen days of or not . 
have you dead tybalt ?
